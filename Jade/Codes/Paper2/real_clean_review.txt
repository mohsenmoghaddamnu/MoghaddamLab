This shoe is perfect for regular everyday users and very breathable for running I do not have the squeaky sounds like the 2017 model anymore

I have never worn a shoe that felt so good I have not taken this thing off in 4 days need I say more

I have only had these shoes for a few weeks now but have had multiple short run sessions road and treadmill and lifting sessions These are very comfortable shoes I have to agree with a review i read on here about the fact they squeak while walking i have had this issue before with new Free shoes It has not bothered me enough to stop buying them because i do like the way they feel on my feet i am not sure if it is the outsole material Nike is using but this certainly is not an isolated issue

These shoes are so comfortable I am usually between a 10 511 I have kind of have a wide foot so I went with the 11s just to be on the safe side and they fit great They have a good grip specially on asphalt

I have been running in these shoes for about 4 months now They are extremely comfortable and I love them for treadmill workouts and road runs even long ones The Flyknit material and midsole are more durable than I expected

I really wanted the regular version of the Free RN but they were too narrow for my toes it is a struggle to find shoes that are not wide with room in the toe box I took a chance with these Free RN Flyknit is and they fit well This is my first pair of Flyknit is so I am getting used to the heel but after wearing them over the weekend I am definitely keeping them I wear them as a casual shoe and will be ordering another color

Since getting my first pair of free runs I have gotten nothing else These looked amazing but to be honest they are pretty flimsy it seems I do not know whether due to the fly knit there is not actually enough structure to the shoe or I just got a pair that should not have passed inspection

My daughter has skinny feet and not much of an arch These shoes fit her great

I bought these shoes while on a baseball trip due to me losing my regular shoes Right as I saw them in the store in the all black model I felt appealed While training on off days in these shoes I began to really like the shoe due to its easy tight feel but also so lightweight that it feels like no shoes on at all Once I came back from my trip I have not taken them off and I wear them everywhere weather it is to walk around or to go for a run Now I am looking to purchase the all white This shoe is worth every single penny no doubt still looks brand new

I have always loved Nike running shoes but all these ones have done is disappoint I find myself constantly adjusting the heel of my foot when I am running as the heel portion of the shoe does not fit snug The size of the shoe is not an issue I definitely will not be recommending this shoe to anyone and am a little hesitant to buy Nikein the future as I am a daily runner

I bought this shoes only about 4 months ago I upgrade from the 2017 Free RN Flyknits which I loved These felt even better until they ripped at the top most shoelace hole The knitting material is definitely lighter on these than the 2017s and I guess it was just too much for it to take Never had this happen before

Love the comforrt and versatility of this shoe it is a shame Nike did not make a multicolor colorway this year The previous yearcolorways were exciting and different The 2018 colors are a little booooring

These shoes fit me just right very comfortable for what they are made for The design is very cool in terms of getting rid of the heat while running

I think this shoe is good for it is intended use The flyknit upper is extremely comfortable It is also very breathable The the midsole does not have very much cushion or support but I do not think it was designed to The shoe is extremely light and flexible I have had this shoe for over 3 months and it still looks brand new I expect them to last for a long time It is very comfortable despite its lack of cushioning I could wear these all day They make great walking shoes I think these do well for short runs or runs on lower impact surfaces i do not think they have enough cushioning for runs more than 3 miles unless you are used to shoes like this Overall I think these shoes are great for what they are made to do Short runs and walking I would definitely recommend this to a person looking for a barefoot like feel without sacrificing comfort

Feels like I am walking on pillows Have a pair to workout in and some others for walking around in They hug your feet comfortably not constricting they do not slip off I love them

I bought both the flyknit and regular 2018 Free RN shoes and in my opinion flyknit is way more comfortable inside the shoe Your foot is not as cr and ed and the toe box does not feel as cr and ed If you are choosing between the two I would definitely go flyknit

I purchased these approx 2 weeks ago and they are just what I am looking for I run moderately 15 miles a week with core training These fit the bill with some flair and style The fit is on pointI have narrow long feet and the size 12 fits me perfectly like a sock I could not give an accurate review for the durability because I only purchased these 2 weeks ago NoteI purchased color platinum black white

Needed an everyday shoe to replace last yearfrees These are amazing in every way they are even more comfortable and light that last yearfrees Huge fan of flynit design durability can not go wrong Fit true to Nike sizing Depending on feet mine are a little wider than avg go 5 size up vs Adidas UA

These shoes are great Out of all the free runs I have owned these are the best Great cushion and nice snug fit with the Flyknit These are great gym shoes but also great everyday shoes

Aesthetically much better than the predecessors even more cushion super light what is not to like

Fit well are very light and comfy I got the blue and like them a lot Not sure about durability as i just got them but first impression is good

The Nike Free RN gets better and better every year Updated sole and toes this go around could not be happier with them

Loved the everything about the shoe except the her tab It digs Into the back of my ankle Really comfortable besides that I wear it when I am out walking around all day

Loved This Color Combo and they Were On Sale Very Happy With The Fit and quick Shipping

Very comfortable and very stylish I give this shoe a 9 out of 10 Many compliments when I wear them from both malesand females

These are pretty sweet I love the retro future style The black and white colorway goes with anything I only have one issue the tongue You have to take a little care putting them on otherwise it gettwisted at the top But defiantly not a deal breaker The react is super comfy I like cushioning and bounce more than ultraboost or vapormax I just hope it does not bottom out over time like my ultraboosts did

The shoes fit true to size but if you have a wide foot this shoe is not for you Nike made these shoes very comfortable stylish and very durable Definitely a must cop

Light weight comfy Runs a half size small Wear a true 11 5 had to return and buy a 12 Bought two colorways as well Volt and black and white and black Both great

So first off wanna start by saying these are super fly Fit kinda small I am a true size 11 and I had to go a half size up because I have a thick foot so the size 11 was a little small I am gonna have to double up on these definitely

Great shoe looks fantastic and very comfortable Definitely would recommend this shoe to others

Looks really cool but this shoe is just another example of Nike using thin poor quality non durable material to make shoes last only a few months before you have to replace them Really sad to see them treating customers like this Shoes will tear fall apart within a very short time

Was blown away by the comfort and functionality Expected the shoe to be for lifestyle but after trying on realized how functional the build was The react sole is a bit softer than the epic react and the upper is extremely thin and flexible

I loved these shoes when I got them but after the first wear they shredded the back of my heels while staining the back of them with blood will not be buying or wearing these again

Unbelievably light and cushioned shoe The closest thing to being barefoot Excellent cushioning especially in the heel Runs a bit tight so I ordered a half size larger I like the regular insole on these as opposed to the cork in the 87Pretty decent support all around especially in the heel Takes some getting used to for running have to be careful how you land each step Best for flat roads and track jogging One complaint is the tongue which is just a piece of suedeit keeps folding and sliding down I ended up tacking the tongues in a couple of places to keep them in place

The shoes are great tongue is thinner than expected so do not be surprised People say you need to order a size or a half size up but that is not the fact order your normal size I had to return mine through mail and am proceeding to go ahead and order my actual size Shoes did not fit and they still felt great OVERALL GREAT SHOE

These shoes are so great but they run a bit small I have wide feet but in other styles I see no difference I would strongly recommend buying a half size bigger Otherwise love I was a little surprised because my size was perfect in the 87s Takeaway = 1 2 size bigger you will love

The toe box narrows almost like a soccer cleat so sizing is going to be weird If you have wide feet order a full size up and if you have narrow feet order a half size up from your Foot size My feet are 11 5 and a little wide so I order a 12 I like to half about a thumbs width 2cm of space Between my big toe and the edge of the shoe and my foot to sit in the shoe and i get this with size 12 When i got these in the mail my toe was maybe 1cm maybe a little more from the edge so a 12 5 would have been perfect I think The upper is made of the same material as the exp x14 and the element 87 I will edit this once they break in

I have a pair of Elements 87 and love them so this purchase was a no brainer I was not disappointed Beautiful colorway construction and comfort will not wear them now cuz it is winter in the frosty Midwest but spring will come soon and I will do some serious wearing Another great product from Nike do not hesitate these kicks are the real thing

shoes fit great i can not complain not one bit I like how they compliment my feet so I will buy multiple colors if possible

GREAT STYLE fits well comfort is great looks with shorts and pants

I love this shoe It is great for everyday wear I enjoy running in them as well But they have a thick sole that makes turning rough when I am running in them Very stylish and comfortable I am sold on the react foam

I was hesitant to purchase but the classic throwback look stuck in my head I ended up making a runner purest faux pas I chose style over performance and everything else for that matter Nevertheless the shoe performs very well and the classic look is better than expected it is a rare exception when the coloring of the real thing is better than the picture but these shoes are a rare exception Sail is a true tint and the large Black swoosh with Sail stitching are prefect

The waistband is very constrictive Otherwise the liner weight and stretch of the shorts are excellent I have been waiting for the next iteration of these to come out before purchasing again

Sneakers run small so order 1 2 size larger I ordered 10 5 needed an 11

The shoes look fly I love the colors But even with the laces all the way loose the shoes are way too tight If your feet are wide even slightly these will not work

I ordered my usual size and they were barely long enough to fit my foot In addition the fit of the entry for the foot is so tight that I could not get it on without bending down the back of the heel so it was caught inside against my heel Even with a shoe horn I could not get it on comfortably I do not think a larger size would solve this problem it is just poor design I have other bootie style shoes that do not fold down in the heel They need a tab or some way to hold on to that part as the foot is inserted I checked not durable although I returned them without wearing Other users have reported that they crack too easily after a short time

Best gym running short I have owned to date Brief liner is terrific Great length and nonrestrictive fit The media pocket with vapor barrier is a must have for any short manufactured today it is large enough for an iPhone with case Probably need to start making that a little bigger though Fabric looks feels and performs great No problems with runs or any other defect after 3 months in the rotation I own 4 pair I will keep buying these as long as they make them Bring back the red

So I have had these shoes for about 4 months now and they look awful First off the leather is completely destroyed in the front and gets scuffed like crazy I do not even thinks its real because it peels off a lot and i have had too paint over it Secondly the paint on the sole rubs off way to easy i got some dirt on them a couple days after i got them and i tried to rub it off but the paint just started coming right off Not too mention the lining is worn too and appears too have holes in it I also got these muddy when i was riding on a dune buggy and now both shoes have a pink tint and the mud completely stained them and would not come out ON TOP OF THAT the leather on both is scratched too and will not come off Its not like i even wear these ever single day i like too wear my other shoes too such as my Curry 2 5 and Air Jordan Ultra High Retro 1 flynitetc I mean my Air Force 1i got like 2 1 2 years ago are in better condition then these and i have done way more in them do not get me wrong i have done a lot in these shoes too but quality is certainly lacking in their design The only reason these kicks do not get one star is that they have a cool street ready build and they go with almost anything i also have a lot of complements in so i mean if you want these shoes too stay nice you have gotta like do nothing in them which is NOT the point of having nice shoes NIKE please improve on your quality of these shoes They cannot withstand anything I am disappointed too give such epic shoes a bad repGener41Thunder

My daughter plays club soccer and all she wears are Nike I tried saving a few bucks and ended up regretting it while trying to break them in she got a quarter size blister on the back of her ankle way to go Nike on the quality of the shoe

Super comfortable I feel like I can run for miles I bought two pairs different colors

I am a huge fan of the Air Max 90 and own several pairs but something has changed I loved the look of the blue but the shoes were way too narrow at the toes I had the same issue with the watermelon air max and lately I have seen other reviews with the same complaint Almost returned these but I was able to pass them on to someone else Nike please fix this issue

I am 5 10 165 lbs 31 waist and bought size medium Nike says medium should fit 32 25 waist These shorts have all the features updated waistband pockets notched hem perforation reflective trim I want except for comfort fit Feels like I am wearing a jock strap very tight waistband and inner brief compared to previous Nike medium running shorts I will give them another week to see if they stretch a little before returning them

Absolutely recommend I have always had problems with shin splints and after a day of practice is these they were gone and have not bothered me since I read many reviews that these were very narrow and hard to break in which made me very hesitant because I have always considered myself to have wider feet but they fit like a glove and have not hurt my feet once Absolutely love these shoes

I am very unhappy with this shoe I ordered the light blue zoom cage 3 and it was perfect color and fit The shoe was NOT durable though because within 2 months my shoe cracked on the bottom Nike swish They do not have a large selection of my size 11 and I am very unhappy I then ordered the crimson tint which are a very unattractive color and I do not recommend buying them and they fit terribly I absolutely hate the color options for this shoe

This shoe runs very narrow My feet hurt extremely bad after a day of tennis The skin of the shoe fell apart in two months and is not covered under the 6 month warranty Also the tongue of the shoe is connected to the shoe and makes it hard to put on and take off I miss the Cage 2 shoes

The Cage 3 is a perfect snug fit with the bootie construction and significantly lighter than the Cage 2 I am a toe dragger and these have shown no signs of wear after 1 month of heavy use Took about 1 week to break in Highly recommend if you are hard on your court shoes and rely on speed for your game

Very comfortable you can chill with shorts or jeans and sturdy enough to train in Goog support a little narrow until you break in look good with casual wear recommended

Very light weight and easy to get on and off Run slightly small true to size

Stylish shoe Great material Way to attract some heads

My 7 year old daughter is very picky when it comes to anything I bought this shoe hoping she would just wear it for outdoor activities but she likes the shoe so much she wears it everywhere She says its really comfortable and durable

My daught like it very much Its verycomfortable I recommend it

Shoes are a little chunky and make your feet look wide I think my personal style is more of a minimalist shoe without the extra bulk But they are fine for what they are Just not my particular style

These shoes look great and are comfortable I would not work out or run in them but for casual wear they have earned lots of compliments

These shoes are comfortable and I love the way they look

Looks good with all the clothes Great for an everyday shoe

I just got some mas money and these are not available in a size 11 or 10 5 Are these a special release or something I was going to buy them especially at a such a great price hopefully they will restock them in my size soon

Great sneaker Looks great with jeans too Very comfortable

Item was exactly as was described and timely shipping Good job guys

Comfortable and attractive I would recommend these shoes

Made for comfort and style Im very impressed in the way the shoe feelsize on my feet Nike great job

These sneakers are great for just running around doing errands and being able to stay comfortable A must buy

Shoes are very shock absorbent and comfy when walking around in not so much when standing around in but love the look of the shoes always wanted them and now I have them

Great fitting shoes Very nice shoes I own a few pair of these styles

I would love to get more pairs of these

I have 4 pairs of Air Max 90s and for some reason the left shoe rubs against the top of my foot on the left side I am hoping once they break in a bit this goes away and is as comfortable as the other 3 pairs

These shoes are really comfortable I love them and they look nice also

Comfort durability and stylish I have bought this pair of shoes multiple times and still feels like the first time

Focus on the product and your individual experience using itShoe has excellent support for feet and the fit is true to size The detail and quality match the price point

Another great pair for my collection AIR MAX or nothing Thanks Nike

I love these shoes The comfort is everything to me so thats the first thing I noticed The style of shoe is very clean and goes good with Nike joggers The color way is great for the winter Ive gotten many compliments Thanks Nike

My wife orders these for me I wouldnt have picked them myself but now that I have them they are the best I love the colors and fit and they are so comfortable Great shoes

Not bad They are good I will be wearing them in the future

I always roll with Nike because they make a nice reliable shoe In this case it was on sale and in clearance and I couldnt pass up Got a good deal with this transaction so Im happy with my purchase

My Daughter Like most is Very Active this is by far her favorite running shoe

There air maxs what can you say A very comfortable shoe

I love the sneaker they feel good to walk in and run in the park

Great shoe but not very durable Daughter loves them

These are great although for some reason the left foot gets bothered on the inside but thats just me It may be different for everyone else Even though the colors look kind of blue in person its gray Its a great looking shoe

Love these shoes I went on vacation to Mexico so I knew I was going to be walking and standing around a lot and these were the perfect shoes Fit great and they are really comfortable plus they are very stylish always a plus

Nice and comfortable I would definitely recommend it to someone

Nike at its best the details and comfort are just out of this world hold one in your hand and you`will never buy another brand

My feet stay very comfortable I can stand on my feet longer in a Nike shoe

You cant go wrong with a pair of am90s Air max 90s are my favorite shoes I own 13 pairs They are classic comfortable Reliable

Bought these for my 5 and 8 year old daughters they love them and could not say enough good things They love the comfort and they seem very durable

Super impressed with this shoe love the style and have been wanting to buy a pair and I finally did Very impressed with the comfort too Overall great shoe and I recommend the 90s to many of my friends

The feel and look amazing I would highly recommend

I do not actually run in these I always liked this shoe and the solid gray is dope

Didnt looked like what I expected But they feel good overall I returned mine Just wasnt digging the colors

They look great with everything I rock them at work and on the weekends They are mad comfortable and last forever

Got my shoes fast The shoes were awesome no damage Shoe fits perfectly It was also packed nicely and was double boxed Air max 90 and air force ones are the best Will definetly order another pair from nike com CU service is also very helpful Thanks nike Nike is the best

My kid love this she was so happy having this and wanted me to get her little sister a smaller version

My daughter has reached for these sneakers every day since they arrived They run a little big in the length but are comfy and adorable Thanks for making such a versatile sneaker

Once I first got them they were cool but the suede on them gets very ashy and faded but that is what suede does It still gives a good look to the shoe Also the only problem I had was that the shoe ran a little narrow but it might just be because my feet are a little wide but other than that its a good shoe

I love this shoe I bought a pair for my daughter and she asked for a pair in every color

The Air Max 90 is an overall great shoe I do not use them to run because there are others on the market that are better runners but the 90 is a great casual wear shoe Very comfortable and durable

I purchased these shoes for my boyfriend and he indicated that these were the most comfortable Airmaxs he has ever worn They may run a little small but he is wearing to see if he can break them in Awesome look I originally was looking in stores but learned they were only available through Nike Ordering was easy and fast Overall great shoe and experience

I love these shoes they feel good on her feet Im order more for my nephews and nieces

Air Max 90 is a classic shoe This color way is so simple and clean but it really pops with the subtle red hits

These shoes are very comfortable and stylish I have a wide foot and was worried the shoe would be too narrow but they are just right Love these shoes

I bought these for my husband and he loves them According to him they are beyond comfortable They are true to size and feel pretty durable

Product itself is comfortable great sneakers for everyday wear

Awesome comfort for a light weight clean looking shoe

This pair of shoes are good yet excellent cause when I got them and I tried them on the former partby which I mean the part that wrapped your forefeet is somehow a little bit tight and making it uncomfortable the size is right the length I mean The cushion is soft and very comfortable Nike shoes has always been my favorite so I still want to give it a five stars of its amazing design

Price is below MSRP too

The air Maxs I got have a great durability My fav

Nice shoe Good Air Max quality Size is true to fit Step right on the track and ready to go

As soon as I put these shoes on it felt like I was walking on clouds These shoes are very comfortable and feel very durable They fit perfectly depending on your shoe size and can be taken anywherem

I was very amazed when I receive this package I thought it wasnt gonna be that good but it was excellent and it fits perfectly well

I like this shoes very much It looks like very cool

Comfortable running shoe Up to date appearance and easy to clean

Shoe fits true to size Not too wide or narrow Could use more cushioning would not use it for running but it is great for walking Color schemes and fabric looks better in person

Shoes are great for running walking or even for casual wear It is also comfortable and fits true to size

These sneakers are very well made Got it on sale great price My husband is super happy

The product is really good for everyday use casual walking training and running

This is my second pair of Air Max 90 I need shoes with good arch support because I suffer from over supination and sometimes my knees hurt after long walks This shoes have helped me with my problem and I love the design

Cant go wrong with Air Max 90 perfect shoe for all purpose I would not use for running though they are a bit heavy

The air max 90 is one of the most comfortable and also stylish pair of air max Not only can you get a great workout in these you can also be stylish Would recommend to anyone

These shoes are Awesome When they first came out years ago I always wanted a pair but never got a chance to purchase a pair And then they were discontinued Im glad they are back in with the fashions of today I purchased two pair Thanks Nike for bringing the Air Max 90s back

I loved these shoes They are so comfortable i have decided to get another one in different color I highly recommend this product

Bought for my daughter She loves the way the feel and look

Looks good and feels good You cant go wrong with the Air Max 90

My favorite color combo is Black and Red and I love how Nike designed this shoe so it wasnt all black Typical comfortable Air Max I actually got a compliment from a sales guy in the referee shoe store yesterday Its either Nike or nothing

Airmax 90 are a comfortable pair of shoes I work in a warehouse where I am on my feet for 12 hours a day And at the end of day my feet arent hurting Thats a shoe I will keep investing in

Purchase this product for my son and he enjoys the look and comfort of the shoe We will be purchasing the all red Airmax for his birthday coming up really soon and also be buying this product for his brother

I am in love with all Air Max 90s I own them in 4 different colors now and intend on getting at least 3 more I definitely recommend the shoe

This shoe is an attention getter Comfortable and gives a feeling of stability when walking Good support

I love airmax sneakers no complaints Not really much of work out buff but these sneakers make me feel like I do Thanks Nike

Love these Got them for my bf for his bday and he loves them too

I love the air max 90 I have a lot of older models and they lasted me many years and I would continue to purchase the new ones to if there are colorways that I like Great shoes you cant go wrong

Great fit and a great style Feels like I am running on air

Nice deep red unlike all the pink stuff coming out over the last few years

These sneaks are super comfy great price at under 100 and I love the colorway

Loved the gym show very comfortable this style is my favorite have a least three other different colors

They are comfortable and sleek enough to turn heads

Very comfortable shoe fits nice and tight without tightening the shoe laces Quality and stitching is superb Will definitely buy more and spread the word

I always have very good experiences with Nike Air Max shoes These shoes are stylish very comfortable right out of the box and feel right for just about anything you run into I actually do not buy these shoes for running but use them for just about everything else I do I would recommend them to anyone Added bonusThe Customer service at Nike Com is outstanding Steve and Jeremiah are both top notch very knowledgeable and make the entire purchase first class Thank you

When the sneakers came they were a different color than what they looked like online and they are tight on the sides I love air max nikes but these were kind of ugly good shoe tho

I love my Air Max 90s They arrived in a timely manner I would recommend anyone and everyone to purchase Air Max 90 They also very comfortable

I bought this for my husband who always always wears a nike air max He loves it and the color can be matched with any clothing he has so it was a perfect buy

Love this style and comfort Been a AirMax client for years

I will buy another pair soon so worth the money

I bought these more for style than comfort cuz I have wide feed

I would recommend this shoe to anyone 100 satisfied

The Air max 90 shoe is a comfortable shoe and also has a nice style to it I have been getting a lot of compliments on my pairs I like this shoe because it gives that bolky style that looks just right I would also say that the air bubble gives myself a couple inches taller I would really recommend this product it is a sturdy product and a comfortable one

Nice looming shoe comfortable runs slightly narrow like all nike shoes

Very comfortable Classic design Can wear with just about anything

I have had MANY Air Max 90since I really like this classic design I really like this dark navy monochromatic color way on the AM90 It looks great with light colored pants while being so comfortable

The air max 90 is the perfect blend of style and comfort however I would run on them They are a style sneaker not a performance one

Super fast shipping and very comfortable shoes Item received is better than picture posted Bought as a gift and absolutely worth the it I just wish it price would go down I was hoping it will be cheaper here than outside vendors

The Air Max 90 in its original form never gets old Not only is it stylish but upholds a maximum level of comfort I can not get enough of this shoe and will probably purchase the all grey and all black color ways as well

This is one of my favorite style that Nike has come out with Love them

Great durability and comfort highlight this shoe Highly recommended plus it is a classic silhouette

I have been looking for a specific design Finally I would found it with these shoes This is my favorite Air Max so far It is very comfortable and the design is really awesome It runs wide too which is good for the people like me who have wide feet This product is not just for running and trainingit is also for fashion Also I like the feel when I wear these shoes The materials that they have used were really suitable for the tired feet I can wear this all day Will purchase this again Thanks Nike

Extremely comfortable and very classic I recommend you get a pair

I love this shoe because it has a great arch support

I love this product so much I wanna own all of them

These are perfect for running and style Ill wear them when i train but also wear them for fashion They are very comfortable

I simply lose these sneakers because that are extremely comfortable and gives the same level of comfort to my feet like the Air Max 360 however it is not just a running sports shoe which you can not wear at a little formal occasions The grey color gives it a nice formal touch and they can be worn everywhere

they fit great the design is one of the best Their very comfortable Easy to clean They are all together a great show My boyfriend and I always rock nike

A very good buy and I highly recommend this

Yes believe it or not these are my first official pair of Nike shoes I think I am in love These shoes are fantastic and the white is gorgeous I am hoping to invest more into Nike soon along with Jordan Air Just be aware you would be best sizing a half up if you have wide feet I did that and it worked out for the best

Delivered in 2 days Sneakers were dope

Shoes are comfortable Do not recommend to run Look nice for everyday shoes Most likely to buy another pair in different color

Very comfortable and nice and has good support on my feet

Although it feels a little tight and narrow hopefully it will break in nicely i love the overall look of this shoe

I personally really like the shoes The shoes is very comfortable to wear I would recommend this shoes for everyone

This shoe has had staying power for a reason Stylish comfortable durable true to size

I have always liked air max shoes I love the fit the look but most important I love how comfortable they are

Love this color way and the look of this sneaker It does not make my foot look big and looks great with shorts The front is a little bit narrow but it might be because I have not broken them in All in all great sneaker for a great price

They are not the lightest shoes but definitely the most comfortable

nike looking shoes must have product

i really like this pair of shoes not only because the nice design with classic white black and grey color but also for the comfortable

Air Max 90 remain the most comfortable shoe I have worn They are versatile for either running walking or just having a cool pair of shoes to wear

I bought these Nike Air Max 90 Essentials for my husbands birthday and they were exactly what he wanted They looked the exact same as they did in the picture with no surprises He loves them

As always Nike puts out a stylish comfortable and all around great shoe with the Air Max 90 This review is for the black grey white shoe which looks blue in the photo I was actually expecting it to have that blue tinge but it came out not blue at all

The shoes is very comfortable for those who have wide feet The quality is good Great for being on feet for long hours

Very comfy and stylish for its price with a great selection of colors

A classic white Nike I get looks and compliments and hope to keep these nice for a long time They shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition

i like and i enjoy all nike products for their comfortability and their fashion style

I only wear these as sportswear Go great with light and dark jeans

I just got the air max 90 and they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever wore I would recommend this product to anyone

Great product Good material Greay Purchase Noce shoes

I bought the exact pair in 1990 And they are just as stylish now as they were then I wear them around town and I love them They are very comfortable I can not imagine running in them

Ended up going to a nearby Nike store and changing them for the right size now I feel good on my Air Max 90 Essentials

This product is very comfortable and very durable

Great shoe for every day use I love to just slip on and mess around in them

The shoes are great They are very comfortable Break in time is minimal and they fit my wide feet perfectly Super under rated shoe in my opinion

Fits great very comfortable Use it primarily for work for long durations

They are so comfortable and they look great with jeans good for everyday wear and the color combos are awesome I recommend them

These shoes are very comfortable Get alot of compliments

these shoes are very nice and have good traction for everyday use

got this shoe in anthracite black about 5 days ago and i couldnt be more thrilled with my purchase the color mix was good and also a great option if you do not just want the all black color shoes feel very durable from the few times worn so far and exceptionally comfortable would defenitly recomend this shoe product to anyone looking for a great all around sneaker shoe

Love air max to the fullest But the color way and comfort level of these are top of the line Great shoes

Comfortable shoes I have received numerous compliments on them

I was really impressed by this shoe The comfort level is really good and it is not to narrow on my foot Overall a really great shoe

It is a good shoes but somebody asked me about the leather Is it made from pigskin or cow skinI do not have any idea about it Somebody can tell me

Picked up my all black pair last week and would not trade them for anything picked up a second pair with the Crimson and Black as well These are super comfortable super lightweight and a fairly true fit to their size If you have never had a pair you need to make that purchase here on Nike com and post your review

Copped these onAirMaxDay Nike Head Bliss I Love them

These classics are too sick chicken soup will not even help Of all the Nike classics the 90s are the ones sitting upon the pedestal

This design is 25 years old that is older than most of the people who will read this review I remember seeing them in store as a yungun thinking that they were the fanciest things I would ever seen And by gum they still hold up

It is super comfy Its also good looking and practically glows with you

Love this color scheme so much i bought 2 pair Everyone should have Air Max 90 in their arsenal Classics

I like this shoe very much for fit in all purposes Great fit and very comfortable

Love me some Air Max 90I can wear this shoe with someshirt and jeans or a button up and khakis and be good to go The only thing is after not even a week of wear I am already seeing creases on the sides With that said I still love wearing these few other shoes are as comfortable as these

This shoe was very comfortable for just casual wear I am a high school student and i basketball player and i wear these sneakers most of the week just casually The only problem was that when i wore these after a few days one stitch came apart and there were many creases along the inner side of the shoe Other than that this shoe was excellent

I have been looking for these Air Max for a longtime i actually remember get these pay back in the day Hint i graduated hs back in 94 so these bring back memories

When I wear these shoes its a bit wide like my ankles sides make it wider but also it helps me out with running but hard to clean the front of the shoe used a brush hard to get the mud out The sole is smooth and soft it is a alright running shoe but not one the best running shoes i had

Classic shoe that you really cant go wrong with It has a great silhouette and a colorwayto fit everyone I get compliments on them all the time Drop the coin and get the shoes

Very happy with my purchase one of the most comfortable sneakers ever owned Will be buying another pair of air maxnext year

These are the best shoes I ever had there very comfortable there very nice and the price are not too bad These are gonna be my next pair of shoes for the rest of my life

Great fit and awesome comfort Whether its just walking around NYC or jogging these sneakers are just what I need Major plus is they look good too

I got these a while ago and tried them on and they were great but i put them in the box for maybe a week and then i pulled them out and the mesh was a greenish yellowish color it looks a little bit like stale milk very comfortable i do not use them for running as much as a fashion statement but very durable shoe as well

Comfort Also I love colors match of the shoes Good design

I can not recommend these maxes Almost unwearable for longer than 30 minutes Very nice looking though

very comfortable shoe fits jam up prefect cross traning shoe also great style shoe would recomend this shoe air max 90 to anyone cant wait until these ware out to get another pair

The sneaker is very sharp looking and goes with most clothes It is also really comfy I use them as my going out sneakers I do not use them to work out in

I love the shoe but the shoe looks yellow and it was like green when it got to me

I like the shoes but the blue is nothing like the picture Much brighter more electric blue than it appears

Shoe has great support very comfortable stylish would definitely recommend this shoe

Solid and good looking shoe

The shoe looks and fits great Was so easy to order on my phone Customer service was awesome An agent actually answered the phone without my having to go thru any prompts which is extremely rare these days I have been a Nike customer for over 20 years and love the look and especially the durability of all the Nike shoes I have ever owned

Use for everyday wear and ging to the gym Very comfortable Good cushioning

Great shoe would recommend to anyone looking for a long lasting pair of shoes Got my roommates to buy some and they love them too

The product had cracking soles stain on the upper stain on the sole

Product is light but durable This is my 2nd pair which I use at gym regularly

Looks good Feels good Great support Great color choices

The shoes look good it is just they run big and are very uncomfortable to wear before they are broken in

I really like the Nike Air Max 90 but these guys run small but really comfortable I recommend them

i like these shoes I usually wear them for style or fashion But If I run in them i feel like i am running in my socks Good by the way and they are a good style shoes Good Colorways by the way

The all leather shoe feels a little snug but still comfortable

A great fitting running shoe comfortable that is very stylish

do not really write many reviews but I have to give love to these classics Just picked up a pair in the Dark Grey Cool Grey Anthracite Volt colorway and its one of those rare exceptions where they look much better in person than online instead of the mesh toebox there is a sort of pseudo ripstop material which makes the shoe look nicer and makes it more sturdy such a classic

Sneakers arrived filthy Black spots all over and dirty laces

They comfortable durable and really good looking I get compliments everytime I wear them

Feels good looks amazing Must Have An the air maxcome in multiple colors can not get any better then that

I use my Airmax primarily for casual wear It is very comfortable and durable

Great traction and secure fit great style

I love airmax and feel in love with the green and grey 90a must have for me

It comfort for me wear every time to anywhere that I use them

I bought these shoes to conduct PT in while overseas and they are good for the feet as I run at over 5 000 feet above sea level and are also stylish and get compliments every time I run in them Thanks Nike for your continued support for the troops while we protect the homefront

I would be sure to order another pair of these shoes I would also tell a friend about this product and how well I was handled by nike and what a good job you guys done on the order

Great shoe wanted something to look like the stylish gray new balances but i love nikes and they were perfect at great price

You will experience immediate comfort the moment you lace the shoes up Wouldnt recommend training in these but definitely great for casual wear Not to mention that these shoes are an eye grabber

They are a really good sneaker one of the best i have purchased and are rather comfortable and nice build quality

I had a tough time trying to find these blue suede shoes but when I received them from Nike com I was very pleased The quality of the suede is outstanding The shoe is built strongly with none of the flimsiness of other sneakers Excellent foot support The addition of both blue and white laces was a class act Really changes the look of the shoe I am just wearing these for casual wear so cannot comment on running suitability

Purchased the Hyper Blue pair for a modern look on a classic shoe Great for casual wear and perhaps a light jog However they are not the best running shoe the always innovative Nike has I highly recommend these for casual use and as I previously stated they are a neat take on one of Nikemost popular shoes

Would not recommend this shoe for training purposes It is a stylish shoe but it is heavier than most training shoes I prefer the nike freeBesides that I love them and am looking into buying another pair

I love the Air Max shoes and this is my second pair

nuetral rating all catagories i havent used shoe yet i do not intend on using this shoe for fitness rather fashion most air max are really heavy and uncomfortable to work out in but they look sick hopefully 2013 air max will do better they look lighter and more flexible

I have always had great experiences in Jordans and now my son has and will A great shoe for a little one when they walk and they look great in them as well

Got these as a gift for the husband and he loves them Loves that they are stylish and cute Can rock these anytime of the year and would definitely recommend buying

Very light weight and comfortable shoe First pair are almost a year old and still look great I am ordering every color You can not go wrong

I bought these shoes a week before I left for Nashville The entire week before the trip I wore them and all day in Nashville I wore them I never had pain on my feet whatsoever Comfy to wear The mesh top makes it easy for my feet to breathe I would 100 recommend these shoes

These shoes fit perfect and are very comfortable I wore them recently on vacation I walked around town all day and my feet did not hurt at all Also these shoes are very stylish

I have a bad knee and after the purchase it really shows that this shoe supports that So far have bought myself 1 pair and my daughter has almost all the colors Thank you they are extremely comfortable This shoe is great for walking jogging and standing You will not be disappointed

Needed a stylish shoe for everyday school wear Comfortable and looks great Well made and looks as though it will last longer than most athletic shoes Good support and fits true to size

The sizes run smaller I normally get a 13 but it would not fit So I needed a 14 and no one was available

I really like these shoes the fit and the style are perfect for me Very comfortable I purchased 3 pair white black and navy blue I never bought adidas in my life Thought I was Nike Air Max for life I WAS WRONG

COMFY AND SLICK GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME WHEN I WEAR THEM

Good shoes Nice fit Great price

Looks nice great pricemy son says they feel very comfortable He loved it I enjoy looking at themxe2 x98 xba

Casual wear and light excercise shoe

The shoe fits wider then it is Nike adversary So for me the width was nice but the arches were too high If you have flatter feet then this show is definitely not for you

I was amazed how great these fit and the feel I usually only wear Nike brand sneakers but I must admit I may have to look at ADIDAS now

I bought these shoe for there style and casual wear

LOVE THESE SHOE COMFORTABLE THEY LOOK GREAT IN BLACK

Very happy with this purchase Shipping was fast The shoe is very comfortable and stylish I bought another pair because I was so pleased with the product Would definitely recommend

Definitely a great shoe support light weight stylish all around good purchase

I really like this shoe they felt a bit odd when I first put them on but now they feel good on me a little getting use too

The black on black are dope I get many compliments on them

The shoes wear great I will be visiting the local store soon to exchange to another size Thank you

When my shoes arrived the left shoe is yellowish grey and the right is white as seen in the pictures here It looks like totally different material They were bought as a gift so someone and I was kind of embarrassed about the 2 different looking shoes

I ordered this shoe as a Christmas present for my son he is satisfied with the fit and receives a lot of compliments from his friends A few of his friends have recently ordered this shoe but in a different design

Purchased for my son and he absolutely loves them This is his 3rd pair of flux in less than 6 months

I like shoe in the finishi lin com

The shoe has an amazing look due to the materials Adidas had used for the shoe It allows for the image to be placed on the shoe with amazing quality and texture while the feel allows the wearer to feel that it will not run bleed or fade These are an amazing pair to add to any collection and durability assures you that it will stay in the rotation for a good amount of time

get a lot of good compliments on this unique shoe true to size The wave print is vinly ish and easy to clean which is a nice feature and keep the shoe super light

Awesome shoe great value Adidas did a great job with this new style Love the print on these very lightweight

The personalization is awesome Adidas has been my favorite brand for 30 plus years now So cool to have my own pair I feel famous Famous enough at least

These shoes are the most comfortable for my feet i have ever experienced i walk 50 miles a month an my feet feel great Bring back navy blue though 

I used this shoe for more less my daily life from school to dates And it fits be perfectly the cushioning that it provides means i can go on shopping dates with my GF and yet my leg does not hurt from all the walking and standing I have yet to try to run in it but i am sure it will do just fine in supporting my legs

I really liked these shoes But now the stripes on one shoe is peeling off

Love my shoes They are super cute and comfortable

Great shoe lightweight stylish all white very comfortable

these are bomb I got my pair today and there amazing and very comfortableand fast shipping So worth it

This shoe is really good It actually looks better in person than online I love how it is so comfortable The shipping was amazing My shoes came in two days And unlike Nike the shoe feels comfortable and looks better I highly recommend this shoe for anybody out there

True to style These shoes complement your outfit always and never take away style with one color

I use this shoe mostly for daily activities sometimes I run and play backyard sports and these shoes hold up through all of it They are surprisingly easy to clean and everyone at my school loves them

I love my shoes I already bought 5 adidas

This shoe is amazing its comfortable stylish and has good grip light weight and is an overall well structured shoe

I love the zx flux brand because of all the colored shoes and I love colored soles I have 4 pair I got these hot pink shoese and they are super dope you will not be disappointed I have gotten soo many complements

These shoes are much better looking in real life I have already received a lot of compliments on them They are also comfortable good for running and moderate amounts of hiking and match nearly everything in my closet Overall an excellent purchase

Nice style very comfortable can wear almost anywhere

This shoes are awesome especially if your really active and like to run you will love this shoes

with the nice color and comfortable

Very comfortable flexible fitting and stylish

Comfortable and look nice The fabric is good quality and everyone likes them

These shoes look so awesome in person Buy these while they are still in stock Totally worth it

Nothing but all round great service super delivery on time and number one price guarantee Brilliant purchased 3 pairs while on vacation in the Windy City shoes are a must

I am not a runner at 81 I purchased the shoes for their bright colors very comfortable fit and of obvious Adidas Master quality Oh yes they are fun to wear

Read a lot of reviews stating to go half a size bigger but to me these fit true to size The look of this shoe is amazing but the feel is even better If you have never tried a zx flux on before they almost feel like slippers with good support That being said they are rather warm after wearing the shoe for a while Otherwise a great buy Get used to getting complimented and people looking at your shoes all the time with these

great shoe

Luv this shoe comfortable and stylish Customizing it was a plus

All though this shoe may seem a bit simple it is comfortable and very fashionable

These shoes live up to the hype Besides being killer looking they are super comfortable out of the box Buy them now Overpay even Totally worth it

BEST LOOKING SNEAKER EVER I AM 60 AS COOL AS THE SNEAKERS I WEAR

Extremely comfortable Would recommend

These shoes have good comfort and look great These are my go to shoes if want to look nice I always get good comments on these shoes Nicest shoes I have ever owned and my first pair of Adidas looking forward to get more of these

The fit of these shoes are about a 1 4 size large I know that sounds ridiculous But they are not too large to justify me noting they are 1 2 size large Or it could just be the cut of the shoe to give it that larger feel

I love these sneakers I am loking to buy another pair to add to my zu flux collection

I love these shoes They are light weight comfortable and have a lot of different styles which I really enjoy I like these shoes some much i bought my wife 3 pairs I would totally recommend these to anyone

great app idea for custom sneakers for a classic name brand

if you are a woman buying this shoe completely ignore the adidas size chart it is wrong It says a size 8 should buy the 7 do not do that 6 5 is probably a better bet but I will not be trying again so I do not know for sure It was also uncomfortable but Idk if that is due to the overall size issues The arch feels too high and the whole arch area just put a bunch of pressure on my foot Very uncomfortable it is a good looking shoe though so 1 star for that

When my shoes came in they were the right fit and they are extremely comfy

Great shoe very comfortable not as breathable as I thought But it was worth the buy The colors showed great when the sun hit the shoes

I do not usually spend a lot on shoes I find shoes that fit are comfortable and do not look too bad That is until I saw the ZX Flux shoes I have always loved iridescent things and boy do these fit the bill They look fantastic and are very comfortable Many people have commented on them in my first week wearing them I bought a second pair for when the first pair wears out I must be in my second childhood AWESOME

Excellent support on the feet

These are THE shoes to have They sell out as soon as released and for good reason They are great running shoes and very comfortable but the best part is the changing snakeskin colors I get nothing but compliments on these shoes That is why I own 3 paris now Get them while you can

Shoes are comfortable and stylish

Got them for my 16 yr old son and he loved them Very cool shoes

Nice cool shoes

This shoe was so comfortable and had amazing quality The craftsmanship was great and the 3M is beautiful Just a little wide but Adidas tend to run a little larger for me If you are on the fence get them You will be happy you did I got a lot of complements and the shoes look good on foot

The shoes are okay The 3M seems to be more vibrant through a camera lens Through the human eye the 3M still takes affects but its not as bright These shoes run big when I say big I mean size I recommend going half a size down for a good fit going down full size gives the shoe a snug fit I apparently went a full size down the snug fit was okay but the way my toes cause little bump at the toe box at certain angles and when I put pressure on it my feet would expand pass insole would be about 1 2 cm bothered me This is my personal experience of going down full size

been looking all over for this sneaker and I was super excited when adidas restocked them online So I bought my pair and I was so excited to receive them But when I opened them up and took the sneakers out to look at them I noticed a stain like mark on one of the sneakers I do not know what to do because I really want to return them because the mark is really bothering me but then I do not want to get rid of the sneakers because I really love them

This is a brilliant shoe that I have been wanting to get a hold of for ages but unfortunately they barely come in womensizes This shoe should be offered in womensizes or at least sizes 5 to 6 5 for menWhy does Adidas or other shoe competitors in the game offer neon colored or bright colored shoes for females can not a girl get a pair of black shoes or a rad shoe without the extra stuff on it Very disappointed and would probably check out other competitors that offer cooler more high fashionsneakers for women without the unnecessary add on 

Just ordered my second pair now I have the set complete Truly amazing shoes at an affordable price point Styling

Im 42 years old and I collect Shoes I have purchased nearly 100 pair since January alone and now I have come to a halt The ZX FLUX Xeno has wanting nothing but reflective Xeno technology type shoes This shoe has shut down all other sneakers in my collections My Sonand daughterfriends were at our home recently and took photos of my shoes When they saw the Xeno shoes they started posting and tweeting After one hour my kids were telling me my photos were the talk of the town on social media Now that ive found them in my kids sizes they will be just as impressed with the shoe as I am I never wear the same pair of shoes twice in a week but this one ive worn 6 days straight Unbelievable Shoe

Neck breaker

I initially purchased the ZX FLUX XENOfor their insane iridescent qualities The images online accurately portray the effects of the skin I was also overwhelmed by the comfort of the shoes soft lining with a sturdy mid sole It runs a little narrow for wide footed people

Great look and feel Got lots of complements on them at my grandsons basketball game

These are definitely the most interesting pair of sneakers I have ever purchased I can not stop looking down to see how the light is catching them

Will buy more shoes from them

Love them

Received an email featuring these bad boys and when I went to the site it said there were only five left in my size I did not think they could actually look as advertised but nevertheless bought them on impulse They work as advertised and I do not have even the slightest regret at picking these up Some of the coolest shoes I have ever owned and comfortable too Looking forward to more of the iridescent products coming down the pipeline

I bought these shoes based on being really different once I put them on they are extremely comfortable upper material very soft Highly recommended if you like some flash

Awesome sneaker very comfortable conversation peice They rarely appear black when wearing on foot They literally look as if they are glowing I wear them for casual use Very comfortable shoe to walk around in They encase your foot Top 10 shoe out right now Instant classic Classic like this will be up there with shoes they retro at this point game changer write it down

These were the first adidas I have purchased in many years These shoes are comfortable but the design and reflective color scheme was what drew me to these These are my new go to shoe for the coming summer

Probably one of the most comfortable Adidas shoes I have purchased Looking forward to purchasing more soon

i love the shoe they make my foot look a bit bigger than they are but they are really comfortable for walking i did have to get half a size bigger because i did not like the snug fit i like to be able to have some room in there but other than that they are nice sneakers and they are neon good for night time running or just out

always getting compliments when I wear these shoes A order the Onix and have the black flux

Absolutely love this shoe Getting ready to order another pair or two

i would give five stars but i do not like when my shoes crewe and these crease on the inner sides of the shoe but it is not noticeable

be sure to look at the size charts if you wear a size 11 I wear an 11 in most shoes but I had to go half a size down in these Most shoes are a UK 10 in US 11 These are a UK 10 1 2 Amazing shoe though I can not stop looking at them

These are the best Shoes ever

at first i was not so sure about getting them but once i got my first pair i am now truly obsessed with these would recommend with no doubt

Adidas should not make any more of this color way to make it a limited colorway

Many restocking zx ocean event finally I have ordered these style in my size that is so amazing to have this coolest style Thank you adidas so much

i highly recommend this shoe it is comfy and amazing for a pretty fair price THIS IS A GREAT SHOE Keep it up Adidas

These shoes look really cool in person and are very comfortable

I recently bought the Adidas Ultraboost ST Im not a fan of Adidas brand but because of the price discount regular price too high for me and from previous reviews I decided to give it a try Im glad I did After a quick 5k run the shoes are great Great cushioning and support They are lightweight also The grip is good I have issues with my shins and with this shoes no issue at all So far is the most comfortable running shoes I have had

Great product with quick delivery The shoes are comfortable and easy to wear

Love the comfort this is my fifth pair I would only wear them

Always loved the quality of Adidas but this pair is not good Rubber was peeling when I took them out of the box did not even wear them and had to return

I like these because they are great fro running and add more stability than the regular UBI wear them to the gym and they are great except on leg day The cushion is a bit too spongy for squats

I am a fan of adidas ever since but now a lot of their designs are really made for narrow feet Except for this This fits naturally with my big wide feet and it does not hurt like any other shoe Plus the extra support you get from the heel because of the wedge like sole

Looks better in the pictures Was too small returned for a bigger size

These are super comfortable and last a long time I keep buying these because I can not find another shoe quite as pluch as these

Great for pronation and very comfortable It will provide stability for a road run

Great look and super comfy especially after walking in Italy and Greece

I had excruciating foot pain and plantar fasciitis and this completely got rid of it

Great on the feet and overall comfortable Had no trouble with it

These shoes have a strange looking design although they are well made

I love these shoes feels so great running outside or outside excellent materials excellent comfortable

This is the best running shoe on the market in my opinion I have tried them all and none compare to this beautiful combination of comfort and spring Toe box is much more breathable then the Ultra Boost Always go with the ST

I have a wide foot and these are the only cool looking boosts that fit Adidas really needs to make more better color ways or allow customers to customize mon Adidas

Tried several different brands and styles all rode too high in the arch The Ultraboost ST fits perfectly making it through a half with no discomfort or foot pain

As comfortable as the standard ultraboost but with more stability More room in the toe box slightly wider inside Weight is bit more notable in the ST Overall nice fit

Nothing compares to these sneakers usually support shoes are heavy and not so stylish but not these ones Adidas you nailed it They can be worn at any occasion I always have 2 3 pairs in my shoe rack

These run a bit too narrow compared to my other boosts

Very springy and responsive running shoes Comfortable for wide feet Look much better than most support running shoes

The grip of the foot inside and outside wid highest level of comforts with style statement Just love this pair of shoes

very comfortable good for workout or running will buy it again

I am an avid runner who gets around 20 25 miles in every week These shoes are a definite go to for me The boost cushioning combined with the overpronation friendly stability section never failed me once However adidas tends to have the sizes 1 2 too big Please buy 1 2 size US smaller if you want the most lockdown

These shoes are super comfortable provide great traction and stability and look great

I have severe flat feet and overpronation as well this shoe has been a god send The arch support is extremely noticeable better then my orthotic inserts The boost feels much more cushioned and responsive then the traditional ultraboost I went half size up and they fit like a Glove The PK upper feels nice and thick I will be wearing this shoe for the rest of my life and i hope there are new ST models in the works This is a true blessing for anyone with wide flat feet

I have had 3 pairs of these still some of the best and most comfortable shoes I have ever had

I love the style of these shoes The tongue is different than my other Boost shoes which do not have a tongue so the feel is a little different but they still have the crazy cushion feel

The shoes are super comfortable However they were a little longer than I expected Also the product looks better in the images Regardless keeping them because of comfort I enjoy running in these

So comfy and doesnt hurt my feet love it I brought 5 pairs of these and good price too

Excellent shoe and comfort while running both indoor and outdoor along with using for HIIT workouts

If Adidas puts a Boost sole on it you are going to love it I own 5 different pairs of Ultra Boost shoes They are seriously the best

Too narrow fit not comfortable feels different than other boast

This shoe has some amazing shock absorption capabilities almost like I feel it taking the weight of my body The materials feel really comfortable and it shoe securely hugs your foot There is one draw back that I wish they would consider which is to make the to a tad wider I do not feel like I can trail run in this type of she let alone shift quickly from side to side and the side of my foot is almost off Somehow the shoe still works for me though and remains to be comfortable because of its fabrics build quality and shock absorption

Very well made shoe and extremely comfortable and supportive A little wider though than the other runners

I like the comfort and support of these shoes as well as this yearstyle

Perfect amount of support and give The shoe supports your inner arch while being flexible and bouncy at the same time

Nice shoes CP value is high and very comfortable

The shoes are very comfortable which is most important and they are stylish as well

Great and very quaity This the best running shoe I have purchase I bought three pair of them The material is high quality and very comfortable its also fashionable to sport on a night out Thanks adidas I would love to be in a commercial representative your product

I tried running with regular ultraboosts and really had a bad experience I waited a year before trying these and they are much better for my foot strike A little narrow so they can roll around a bit but after about 25 miles they are settling in real nice Interested to see how long before the boost wears out but right now on point

it is comfortable stylish and is worth the money I love the ultraboost st way more than traditional ultraboost

I love the graphic design on this boot It also breathes quite well

Overall great shoe

The Ultra Boost ST model is by far one of my favorite shoes that Adidas has You can not go wrong with buying these shoes they are super comfortable and the materials are superb Great job Adidas

My Favorite Adidas Shoes Best Ultra Boost Color Yet These are really comfortable and supportive I wear them 12 hours or more daily and I am always on my feet running around at work or home These will get you where you need to go and make your feet feel like they are floating on air all day I cannot say enough good things about these shoes

I am on my school Cross Country and track Teams This is by far the best sneaker I have ever run in None of the other brands can compare

This shoe is really useful and comfortable for running

Ultraboosts are the way to go Most comfortable shoe out there and high quality

Shoes are super comfortable and lightweight Great for working out Or casual outings

I am 43 and I like to running but lately I could not After ordering ultraboost I can run like I used to Thanks

Great for everyday use in anything you do After wearing BOOST your feet will seldomly feel fatigued by the end of a long day of standing

A great shoe for anyone needing a softer heal strike

Upper stretches too much After 3 runs the shoes lost all support in the forefoot Would not recommend

The shoe is to wide it is not a good look I will not wear theses shoes to often if they did not cost so much they would stay in the closet I wish I could send them back and get a different style I really do like adidas just not this style

I really love the extra boost support much more cushioning than the original ultra boost And estecially they are on point

Really comfortable and the cushion is outstanding Will buy another pair soon

not cheap but well worth the money easy on my feet and great durability

great shoes need more colors available though

These shoes were not comfortable They fit right but something in the fabric inside the shoe was very rough It felt like little pins sticking my feet I could not keep them due to this

Another awesome shoe Again wish it came in all black without the white adidas logos Thank you

These shoes are overwhelmingly comfortable right out of the box I typically wear size 7 but first bought 7 5s on a reviewer suggestion Those went back because they were a bit big The 7 are perfect I bought these shoes because of my need for prominent arch support These shoes have that without the need for superfeet inserts No foot heel or arch pain I am a very happy c and er

Great for those who need stability The boost is still soft with a higher offset than the ultraboosts

A friend said these were his favorites so I figured they were worth a try Great shoes Highly recommend

I love this color and the boost technology Shipping was very fast

Comfortable for long runs and durable across miles

Fabric will start to tear apart in 3 months or less

I own both the regular UB and these UB ST shoes These are not nearly as comfortable as the regular UB I own From the time I put them on to the end of the day they are not comfortable I am very unhappy with this purchase and am trying to return them or exchange them for regular UB Avoid these I do not know why they are more expensive than regular UB especially because they are not as comfortable

These shoes changed my life I have flat feet and wear orthotic braces The braces are uncomfortable and I can not run in them These shoes have replaced the braces they are comfortable and I can run just like I used to

First of all the shoes are kinda narrow which causes you to ride the outer limits of support second the material used in the heel sticks to your socks for some strange reason third the worse continental rubber is horrible wears out just looking at it

But The shoe said core black core black solar orange it is more like teal and it ruins the shoe especially the design between the three stripes and the toe If you make another color way Core black core black white cloud would make a lot of customers happy including myself

This is my 4th pair and I am addicted to them They are the most comfortable shoes I have

Shoe is not really made fir running does not wear very well your lucky to get 3minthe out of it before seams cone apart

This shoe is not only comfy but will work great for wide footers and wider ankle people Like me I fit fine in the shoe but my ankle is long I guess is how to put it but the ankle collar squeezes to much on the regular UB but these are made to fit So the fact that there not getting the attention they deserved bums me out I would go after more if these had adidas came out with better designs So hope you think about it God bless

These shoes will make your feet very hot no good

Love it treated with waterproofing and now perfect

Excellent shoe for most activities or just lounging around Black and white killer whale color way is on point Super comfortable and durable all around shoe What is not to love

This is a perfect shoe for people who have flat feet The shape is not concave so it fully support a flat section Using with the insole for flat feet is just perfect

Boost St are the only shoe i run In Outside with Gym amazing comfort

My only complaint is that my little toe is right behind the reinforcement on the front edge of the shoe When I run my toe is hitting the end of the plastic reinforcement running across the front edge of the shoe I wear a size 14 not sure if its just a size thing but you guys would be batter off running the reinforment a little further back like on the Supernova ST to make sure it goes past the last little toe

Great potential I liked the shoe but Its too bulky

the construction of the shoe is killing my knees I have to return the shoe

Heav  or pricy Runs narrow Not 8mm 13mm Wide width

they survived a convention under 350 pounds thats better than alot of shoes ive owned in the past

Just finished a 9 mile run and I did not want to take these shoes off They are perfect in every way quality cushioning stability and style I am 65 yrs 6 0 ft 195 lbs and run about 20 miles a week I started with adidas 40 years ago been through all the major competitors and have come back for good

Typically a 12 NIKE so as with most Adi 11 5 in these put in roughly 30 Miles a week on and off road and this is my 4th pair of st Frequently try new product from both Adi and other brands and I have found this to be what I always end up back in happily Just a rock solid all around runner with good support more so than the UB from Adi but not too much

The product is good but not great fit if someone has broad feet

I just tried to wear it and run today it is so amazing esp boost technology Feel like hydraulic When you stop running you can feel the boost is stop working like hydraulic

Would like more sedate and classy color options easier to wear at work Best were the navy blue ones I got in Oct 2016 Current colors do not serve my purpose as well but I buy them for the comfort

Best shoes ever super comfy Adidas rocks and make me customer for life

unlike my other boost shoes this shoe is too bouncy and bulky

I like the upper and inside feel of the shoe but the toe part is too narrowed it is more narrowed than the pureboost I brought I feel there is not enough support on the lateral movement I feel like it is ok for running but nkot good for normal walking It feels like comfortable socks with bad foundation support You should try It in the stores vs pureboost and you shall see what I mean

Very confortable and beautiful range of colors would recommend

it is light weight and so comfortable Excellent shoe

very comfortable have two pairs and will get a third

Next to My Yeezy Boost this is the Most Comfortable Sneaker that I Own

Finally a shoe that has stability and a flexible knit upper I can not wear the ultraboost without stability but I love the boost cushioning I did not buy these before because there were not good neutral colors for women Please keep making the all black version for women We do not want to wear only loud pink and purple stereotypical colors These are great to wear to work or just to walk all over NYC with amazing comfort I can fit my arch support inserts in these no problem I just wish they had more color options for women Amazingly comfortable and my foot does not slide all over the place The design is stylish subtle and more tasteful than the other versions

Just like the looks not the functionality Simple shoe but very good looking

Great shoe Just enough stability for me and the cushioning is more than adequate Replaces the Hoka Arahi as my GTS

Hi have used Ultra Boost ST instead of the regular UltraBoost as I tend to Underpronate a bit Overall the shoes seems great nice comfort yes feels light when running would recommend but if you give it a thought you can definitely get top end speciality brand product at much cheaper cost

Perfect and the shoes are really comfortable and suitable for everyday use

I work 12 hours shifts as a nurse and these shoes are the best

These shoes are like perfect for the people who would love to run jog and walk I run 4 5 miles everyday and it seems like a cake walk for me now after started running with ultrabooston I lost like 10kgin 2months includes a proper diet obviously after started using ultraboostand my feet just loves it

But i want triple white color for this shoe or cream white

I have 3 pairs of ultraboost ST Two of the pairs have perfect depth of the heel but one pair the heel is too shallow I think these are the best shoes ever but you should definitely try them on before running in them so you can return them for a different pair if there is an issue

Very supportive and comfortable In my opinion the toe box material and lacing is improved over earlier version

If you ever try this shoe on you will be amazed at how comfortable and stable it is and you will not want to wear another I really love it and hope it is quality remains the same in the long run

its comfortable and great for walking and it helps take stress off my back

Quality materials breathable and most of all comfortable

I am adidas fanatic every sport garment that I own is adidas brand I love adidas

Great tennis shoes very comfortable worth the price

I am not a runnerI purchased these for work and walking around town Super comfortable and fits true to size

After happily wearing Adidas Sequence Boosts for years I decided to take a chance and try the Adidas Ultraboost ST Well I have to say that I am SO THRILLED about these shoes Although they do not feature the same overt stability of the Sequence Boosts the Ultraboost STride is much more plush while stay maintaining the stability I need I like them so much I have purchased an additional pair and I will definitely by purchasing another pair when I have exhausted my current Ultraboost STI run approximately 25 miles a week and these make running an enjoyable endeavor

As a cross country runner Ultraboost ST is one of the most comfortable and supportive shoes Highly recommended

This shoe is Super comfortable and what is different then the regular ultrabooost is the stability of the shoe

very comfortable much better than the regular ultraboost

I suffer from a lot of foot pain and find most shoes uncomfortable These shoes are amazing the inside cushioning makes walking very comfortable I have a new favorite shoe

Extremely conformable to wear and look really good

Best ultra boost shoe on the market right now Not a one piece upper the ST version has a traditional tongue and laces configuration so the width is adjustable making it very comfortable Has the most boost material giving them the most cushioning on the feet knees and back

I picked these over the regular ultraboosts because of the added support and more locked in feel for running This is my first time in Adidas running shoes and definitely will not be my last These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ran in used to run in Brooks Adrenaline Well done

As for the shoes best most comfortable runners I have ever owned I bought black and red which are actually black and orange but at least they are close The blue is not even remotely close

box mis shaped hard edges dig in your foot foot gets lost in the shoe

The UltraBoost line by far the best running shoe in the market Best way to describe it is like having pillows on your feet I run a lot of half marathons and some full mostly on trails and my feet would hurt really bad afterwards from the rough terrain until I tried the UltraBoost Shoe truelly absorbs the impact from the rough terrains This is my third pair and already looking forward to my next one Also the online shopping experience was first class Got an email right away to inform me that my shoe was being shipped as well as when it arrived at my door Way to go adidas team

A little too high off the ground and not a soft as first pair of altaboost

I have 4 pairs of ultra and this is my 5th but only st I bought these to run in since I those pairs I wear casually I have not had a decent run in these but they are even more comfortable than my other pairs These got more Boost and a separate tongue Only problem with I have with these pairs is the back part kind of slides It never slides off but it gives me that feeling that it will Great pair of shoes definitely a buy if you want to try long distance running or walking

Ultraboost ST looks very impressive The shoes feel extremely comfortable Good for running

Keep up the good work

soft bounce with the amazing high tech styrofoam

The most comfortable running shoes I have ever put on my feet Selection was easy Shipping was fast Great experience all around

Go at least a half size down Wear a 13 in ultra boost but could run a 12 5 or even a 12 with the St version

it is very comfortable sneaker and still manages to stay sexy very flexible on the tongue for your toes and all around awesome

Quality and efficiency both are good to like by any one

Compared to the regular Ultra boost the ST fits wider

Love the shoes except real colors somewhat different than online appearance

Great cushioning stabilization runner The sizing did change a bit from the first release

Hands down THE most comfortable shoe on the market I spend at least 7 hours a day on my feet walk at least 6 miles as well I wish I would have known about the UltraBoost earlier

Too wide unlike the pureboost Pads on the ankles are too thick

Like walking on butter My wife wants a pair So make some in 7 5 white fast

The fit is great the quality is great but the photos on the website mischaracterize the color of the shoes it is almost deceptive how the blue orange shoe is made to look so different from the real product which is almost pink on the front half of the shoe Would not trust the other colorways now as a result

This is my third pair of ultraboosts in the past year and a half and they certainly are not the last They are amazing I run on 4 school and club running teams a year so I need a shoe that can last me at least one season for each team and these are it Adidas did not sacrifice comfort for weight Super lightweight with incredible comfort These are the perfect running shoes with the greatest style you will find in the running world

These shoes have a very cushy sole that reduces impact The knit uppers are soft and flexible

Comfortable great performance Fast shipment Good fit

I am impressed by the continual engineering improvements that ADIDAS achieves in their running shoe product line

Look amazing in person I have transformed from Jordanto NMDand UltraBoosts The comfort of the Adidas is unparralled

Very comfortable shoes for running with great design

Very comfortable but can not really lace them without them falling off

I am 6 5 225 and nobody has ever called me el gato I have no mechanical issues my feet or stride All I have ever wanted in a shoe was the equivalent of two pillows to bolt on my feet Historically though my heal strike would go right through the cushion of a soft shoe which was harder on my body than the harder mid soles These are by far the softest shoe I have used that I do not crash through the padding I am only running on dirt and caliche so cannot rate them on pavement They are replacing my older ultra boost They are softer than the old shoe but the fact that the old shoes held up so well encourages me as to if they will last

Comfortable perfect light will everyday styles

Too small too tight too narrow is not confortable

A bit heavier than the original Ultra Boosts but in a good way They definitely give me more support than my regular boosts have the same level of comfort and I love the Grey colorway

Great shoe however the outer sole the alleged Continental outsole that is wears out after 200 miles but the boost material is intact sorry Adi Dassler but i will usin the Pegasus Turbo

These shoes fit very comfy Definitely my most comfortable of the 4 ultra boosts I own They have added stability in the heel hence the ST name You can not go wrong with these if you spend a lot of time on your feet like I do

Very comfortable for running and daily workouts You will feel less stress on your heel and overall feet if you usually have pain in your feet

the reflective surface is really cool Unfortunately they ran a full size too small

it is a good looking and comfortable shoe i like it a lot

I love the technology and shoes Very comfortable and relaxing Best running shoes

I love this shoe Comfortable nice fits well I would recommend

Cool colur choice and very comfort i would fully recommend this model

Just bought these and love themcomfortable and very good looking shoe

These bad boys are the real deal

This shoe is a sharp looking running shoe Bought it in black white and the UA logo on the side as well as the tongue tab is an impressive low key reflective material great Addition to an already great shoe I was hesitant to order 1 2 size up but it was definitely a good decision The 1 2 size up will give you the perfect amount of room in the toe box without feeling like your toes are crammed into the shoe I did not experience the difficulty getting these on like other reviewers it is simply just learning how to get used to a different fitting shoe Great to run in feet do not hurt highly highly recommended

These are more comfortable than I expected The tongue comes up a little higher than I would like but overall great product

I love these shoes I would buy these shoes again

Very sleek look incredible comfort throughout and light on the feet More colorways please

I got these to use for showering at the gym and for around the pool While I have not used them for that yet I can tell by the materials and design that they will be much better for that than my other sandals Based on reviews on this website and others I went a size up size 11 compared to 10 They are still a bit snug although they are breaking in some Length wise they are slightly shorter than my other sandals Jordan and Adidas both of which are size 10

This sandal is good to use for anything water related such as taking a shower going to a pool or beach or even being inside a sauna The width is a little narrow but once you break them in they become more comfortable I would recommend for sure

I recommend straps on Nike slides Slides fit a little tight I have the right size

Bought 2 different pairs for my better half for fathers day he loves them

Great for shower and walking the material is very soft Hopefully it is durable enough Other reviews claim that they run small perhaps a little bit but you do not want it to be big old flip flops anyway just get your running shoe size and you will be okay standard nike sizing

Love these shoes Love that they are all plastic so they dry super fast They are definitely shower shoes but you can pull off like the kids do They do run super small I normally wear 8 5 womenso i ordered a men7 and were too small I would have preferred to go 1 size up

This sandal is different in size compared to the Nike Benassi Menslides I recommend getting a size bigger This sandal makes a great shower sandal

Not sure why these are not marked in the description or name as a Shower Sandal but these are awesome for pool deck Shower The box they arrive in actually says Shower Sandal on the description I am going to order more just so that I have them as they are tough to find

Thes Nike JDI Slides are what I needed for foot comfort while going to the beach and or the pool Oh lets not forget walking around the house

I read quite a few reviews that said if you order your regular size for this particular sandal they will be too tight narrow so I took their advice and was glad I did I wear a size 12 with my Air Force 1 shoes ordered a 13 with these slides and they fit almost perfect no problem with the width or narrowness I wear them with and without socks the length is a half inch too big but they are slides so its fine I recommend ordering one size above your regular shoe size they are worth 20 bucks

Go up a size I am a size 12 and ended up exchanging them for a 13 I think slides should be a little big

Very narrow Very narrow

When you first receive them they are tight when it comes to width After several wears they have loosened a bit I am 6 6 and size 13

I am very disappointed in how tight they fit Looking for different brand to purchase that will have better truer fit

Really comfy slippers It has cushion inside of the top part which feels really great Strong and elegant slippers

My fiance loves these he says they are the best slides he is had He wears them everyday All day lol

Bought shoes for son as gift He wears an 11 5 in sneakers so I got an 11 in this slide in Reason being is his foot is long and narrow and he still has room in this shoe Great shoe all around love them

My son LOVES his new sandals He wants another pair

orderd same size as my jordans and they fit tight wish I went up a size

These looked like they were made out of a hard material that would not be as comfortable as I thought

Like my slides This is my 3rd pair 1 or 2 more colors and I will have the set How about a Red pair been waiting patiently

Pretty comfy and good fit Great for walks to the mailbox or chilling at the pool

Very easy to wear all day Goes well with casual looks Great to put on after hooping

My son loves them Purchased the black and white pairs Easy to slide on and go

I bought it as a gift online because it was a great deal but after receiving the sandals found out that it was way too narrow for the person I got them for his feet barely went it should have went with the Adidas or Jordan slides at least they adjust

Was in need of some slides for the beach as well as casual wear I saw these were on sale and I am pretty pleased with the purchase Very comfortable and well worth the price

Great Deal my son loves his shoe he always wanted a pair and now he has it

Purchased for my husband to wear to the beach and he loves them wears around the house too Very comfy and good price

it is perfect The size is right fit it is light and soft and i would recommend it to all ages

Stylish and comfortbable Came a little tight but after wearing them a few times theybstretched to fit my feet

These slides look nice and are very comfortable They have cushioning under the upper part that is very comfortable like slippers I brought these on a week long vacation to Mexico and they were comfortable everywhere

I been seeing a lot of peoples wearing these throughout the summer I thought I will give them a try I see what they liked in them They are comfortable light weight If I out wear these after the summer I will be sure to get another pair next year

My narrow foot constantly slides backwards Not comfortable

Love them will always shop with finishline need more coupon will continue to shop

Bought them for work I wear boots all the time in the truck I got these to keep my feet dry

This is a great pair of flip flops that is why I brought 2 pairs

Very comfortable Feel like they have a bit of a squishy feel on the sole but overall more comfortable than adidas slides

The cushion sucks on the slide makes your feet hurt after like 10 mins

do not buy these they run small not comfortable at all bad quality I am going to return these did not even wear them outside yet

I bought these slides for my husband because my son have a pair and loves them My husband loves his so much that he wish he could wear them everywhere Very comfortable wear

We have 8 boys in the family all athletic Instead of buying them clothing I brought three pairs of this shoe They were an absolute hit My nephews wore them right out of the box I recommended them to another relative who brought them for her husband

My sons loves them I did not want him to walk barefoot on cold tile floor during fall winter

The Nike Benassi JDNlI Slides are super comfortable I definitely recommmend them for any type of wear they are very cheap compared to the other Nike Slides

My boyfriend already has a pair they are getting old so I bought him a new pair for Christmas He loves them And will be happy

They are extremely comfortable on my feet Great quality

Bought them for my boyfriend He loves them I might as well get me some too

I like the fit but my feet with socks on slip out often

I wear them to the gym and back pretty much all day very comfortable A

Not really recommended for wide feet although I was able to stretch out the sides a bit

If you are looking to save money and still buy stylish nike sandals at the same time then these are the sandals for you Very comfortable as well Highly recommended

I literally bought these slides a few days ago and I love them so simple yet so stylish I got these in a size 7 and they fit great They fit snug and my feet do not slip out the little balls on the insole feel good against my feet too I just wish I could have found them in a size 6 for an even tighter fit but that is just me Durable and a great spend for 25 you will not regret it Tipif you have wide feet this sandal might be slightly uncomfortable for you

Slippers were hard and uncomfortable and they are not true to size

Love Nike they are a good quality shoe I was able to cash in my reward points and get this free

My boyfriend loves them He says they are comfortable made well and stylish They run just a tad small

I bought these to replace some olders sandals that were being held together by super glue The new sandals are comfortable and do not poke the bottom of my feet as other brands of sandals have done

They love how comfortable they are and of course of the in thing to wear They look great And the price can not be beat

This is a very comfortable sandal it is lightweight and the Nike logo gives it a nice look

I got these for my daughter and she loves them She rather them than any other shoe

My son needed these shoes for his comfort after the game He needs to take his cleats off

Needed a replacement for a older pair of Jordan slides Comfort level and cushion is great May get another just because

Great price got them for my son and he likes them a lot

Very comfortable and great price I had to buy 2 pairs

Although I wish they would have the black white pairs at the time

Pretty comfortable slippers Just make sure to get it two sizes bigger than your own actually size

It was a good buy 20 reward plus it was on sale I think it was only 9 with shipping and you can not go wrong with a Nike product I wear these all day if I am not wearing sneakers Two thumbs up

Great deal only thing wish it had an adjustable strap instead of the nonadjustable strap

We love our Nike slides I try to get my boys a pair in almost every color Sooo comfortable and always a great quality slide I will say it looked like Ace Ventura delivered the package but they were in good shape

This is a great slip on sandal for after games when your taking off your cleats and want to change to something a bit more comfortable and easy to put on Fits great

its a high quality product for a good price but if you have wide feet i suggest you get one size bigger

Very short brief review Fit was absolutely terrible I usually wear 11 5 went for 12 and they barely fit my foot but never want to stay on I have to walk flat footed and cannot walk naturally if I want any chance for them to stay on Quality is low and I certainly will never buy any kind of sandal branded by Nike again

Great sandals and the quality is great bought Jordan sandals and they tore up pretty easy This will last you quite a while Get a size bigger and be more comfortable

These shoes are very comfortable and good for fashion My children like for me to wear things that look cool and I am all about comfort So I get the comfort and a good style all in one

My son loves these when he gets pout of basketball he just slips them on and off he goes

overall quality price and comfort is good just a little too narrow on me personally would recommend to someone who has a narrow width type of feet

Great pair of shoes to walk around in at the house outside

These work for me as I only use them at the gym

Bought these sandals for my dad and he is happy with them He wears a sz 11 but they are a bit snug on him he is stretching it a bit by wearing socks with them

I love the quality and the value The soles are thick and comfortable They are great for outside in the summer The heat of the streets or sidewalks will not be felt thru the soles

I picked up the white ones these a great quality slide that not only feel good but look good as well

3 fairprice

I love my Nike slides and I am thinking about getting a few more pairs of these They are very relaxing and comfortable for my feet after a long day and at my age they are very fashionable too I highly recommend them to anyone who does not have a pair of these

I enjoy these flip flops Many ask why white and its simple I am leaving the heard

The slides are amazing and have great comfort for your feet I can not stop wearing them to places I go and sport events I attend The slides are great for activities to just slip on

The Nike slideare a comfortable pair of shoes which continue to solidify Nikestandard of quality The base of the shoe with the raised round edges feel like a massage to the bottom of your feet making them that much more comfortable

a bit small get 1 2 sizes up then normal they are comfy but a bit snug but that is okay

At first these slides were great They fit nice they were comfortable and they were just starting to really mold to my feet Then this happened The part where your foot bends just suddenly tore on one slide I checked the other just to see and the same exact thing happened Really I have had these less than 6 months and I have barely even used them I used them partially in the summer and just this past week for a trip Annoyed Figured Nike would have better quality materials than this One star for you

Might need to size up at least one full size

boguht 2 pairs one for myself and one for my wife my wifesize is her sneaker size and fit perfectly I also bought my regular sneaker size 14 i could not even get these things on my feet i have never had a problem with the fitment of any nike sandals before but these are just ridiculous the arch of my foot is not even high at all but i could only get my foot half way into these

They are very stylish or eye catching but not comfortable in my opinion The sizing in this model runs small so you might want to go up a size for fitting correctly

Great fit very comfortable good arch support thickness

I love the look and the Just Do IT print on this slide and I really really want to love them but they just do not fit right And after trying Kawa slides and not loving them either well it is not you Nike it is me While Nike sneakers fit me better than most brands the slides do not The fit of the Benassi slide is right at size 14 but there is just something funny about how my foot fits on the footbed it feels like my heels are falling off to the inside as I walk it is almost like they need a bit more of a curve to the slide itself or maybe my foot is just curved more than most people

These are my 9 month old puppy favorite chew toy He chews on them all day long and they STILL have not lost their shape You can barely tell the damage im super impressed all my other sandals are destroyed 10 10 would recommend

Buy them a size up especially if you plan on wearing them with your game day socks They feel a little tight with even thin socks

The slides are very great in terms of comfortably and style too You can just slide them on when going out shopping or doing other kinds of chores as also wearing them to school when you do not feel like dressing up

Good product for the price Very basic slide Pretty comfortable just a little big but very durable and washable

When I do not feel like wearing my shoes I put on my Nike slides they are very comfortable and affordable

She says they are comfortable and really cool she can not wait to get more allowance and get another pair

These are those comfortable sliders ever these are my 3rd pair in 3 different colors

These slides fit a bit smaller first few times to wear they are getting more comfortable as I kept wearing them Very comfortable Nice to wear after working out

These are the best sandals for anyone They are comfortable and everyone should have a pair of them

They are definitely comfortable and a great pair of sandals considering the price but run a little narrow Wish they came in half sizes

These slides fit somewhat true to size however the actual part keeping in your foot is somewhat tight and can get quite hot at times otherwise i great product just wish there were half sizes to size up

I wore these maybe 30 days maybe 40 days total before the sandals broke My last pair of sandals from a different manufacturer lasted me 8 years of normal use Needless to say I will not use these sandals again

These are a good and comfortable pair of slippers but they run a little narrow

Look no further buy this product It was exactly what I was looking for and for a great price

This product was complete what I expected from the site It was durable correct sized and was all mine Thank you so much for your services

Ive sent it back via UPS It was too small I ordered a size 10 and sent it back requesting a size 11 Other than that no complaints

Very comfortable and easy to slide on when you need to go quickly

Got them in three colors for my best friend and he can not stop raving about them

this is the 3rd time ive bought these since I was a kid they are just the right sandal for me comfortable last a long time and so easy to care for thanks

More comfortable than the other brands for sure Nike did good with these sandals

Sandal is comfortable but runs small Sandal needs to be stretch At first very tight fitting I had bought a bigger size and still should have bought one more size up

This is an amazing product and fits great I definitely will buy this again

It look way better in person Great Slippers Everyone should own a pair of Nike slippers

i have nothing bad to say i have always liked nikes and still do

First off I have to give it to Nike for the A 1 shipping of their products They do not hesitate or hold your order The second they can get you item out the door to you they do Thumbs up for that As far as the product Its great Durable great price and long lasting materials Thanks Nike

My boyfriend loves these flip flops and he wears them all the time He wears them in the house too as slippers

it is very stylish and comfortable Great for lounging

The product runs much too tight and narrow in my experience I am about 5ft7 and am of thin build so its not that my foot is abnormally fat or anything of the sort The only way these have been able to fit comfortably are with very thin socks which I do not plan on wearing with these comfortable socks tend to run on the thick side I am exchanging these for a size up and would advise future buyers to go ahead and order a full size up All that considered they are very comfortable and provide very good arch support

I love the shoes that I bought my boyfriend they are very comfortable and very durable he tells me he loves them a lot and would like another pair

This product was a gift for my husband He loved it and wears then all the time

Excellent value very comfortable would definitely buy again

I Can Do Practicly Anything In These Shoes they are Great For Doing Any And Everything

This slip on is perfect for everyone I recently bought every person in my family a pair for xmas and they cant get over the comfort fit and ease that they have come to expect from Nike Perfect 10

I got the male size because the womens was sold out runs a little small but fit really snug This shoe is comfortable for just relaxing around the house or running errands

These are great shoes that cradle the feet for comfort Love relaxing and wearing these

I use my slides everyday and everywhere I even have them on right now Nike slides are the best and I wouldnt use any other brand

Its my boyfriend and I first gift exchange Hes been wanting to buy some new slippers for the longest but could never find the time so I decided to surprise him He loves these slippers literally wears them everyday and anywhere Id allow him that is lol

The sandals are really comfortable and very durable I really like the quality and style They were listed at a great price as well thank you

Amazing sandals very comfortable the camoflauge is a great feature

They fit good when you first get them get your shoe size They are slightly tight on your foot but within a few days of wearing they will be great Only wear them with socks because it is not comfortable without socks They look cool are comfortable affordable and overall a great slide

These sandal are very Comfortable practical and stylish too

It is great comfort and I love to wear them I love the red and black color and the Nike sign

I needed these for after I finished refereeing my matches They are a bit narrow Was hoping for them to be roomier but they are still comfortable and sleek

These Sandals Are The Best Sandals In The World And If I Win This 100 Gift Card I Would Love To Buy More Please Pick Me

I really like this product I have bought them for my sister boyfriend and myself and we all love them Super comfortable and would definitely recommend

Once they were broken in they are perfect due to a none adjustable strap

Very comfortable slide for the money I will definitely buy another pair

I use these sandals after my soccer games They are very comfortable I recommend these to all soccer players

can not stop wearing them They are so comfortable even my sister steals them and I am a size 13

Slippers are very comfortable Fit just perfect and does the job

very comfortable great price highly recommended

I bought these for my son He thought they were comfortable and fit great

they are tight yet very comfortable fit these are very good slippers i also really like the way they look

Good price and good look Recommend people to buy it when you wear it at home or walk

Very comfortable slides Although seem to run small

The best made Sandels for the price it is well worth the purchase even late in the season I purchased a pair in August

Great shoes great price and great comfort and as a special bonus the shoes arrive before expected

Best slides ever and the color is bananas I even bought pairs for my kids

Great for the beach lounging or after a game perfect fit

Bought these for my son to wear to and from the gym for basketball He does not have a thick foot and very tight for him to slip his foot all the way in Heel of his foot almost hanging off the back Already wore them outside so can not return

These slides arrived just on time They look nice and are comfortable The length was great but the band was a little tight at first We just assumed maybe you need to work them in so we kept them

Great for after a workout or just to be comfortable

This shoe is really great My son loves the slider type shoes They are easy to slip on and can be worn around the house or stepping out to the store Im thankful for previous reviews because I had to purchase the shoes a whole size bigger for comfort and they kind of run small Overall I have not gotten any complaints

Very comfy Got the mens ones and sized down because they were a better price

This slipper is what I have been looking for it is comforting and has has great support Ideal for moderate exercise and relaxation

They were smaller then expected but I still like them

Size appears appropriate with ultimate comfort after break in it will feel a little tight across the front at first My kids want to wear mines to school so they be in the cool crowd Wow my kids think I am hip again

These slides are the real deal HolyField lol Very clean and simple but gets the job done Very durable and comfortable feel Taking it back to the basics not complex just a good overall product No major complaints

My son has wanted some for sometime Finally I got him a pair and he hardly takes them off He said they feel so good to his feet and he loves them Several of his friends have now bought some too

DOWNSIDEThese do not dry quick So if you get them wet the inside will not try quick unless you want to wait overnight so they do not really make a good shower sandal

Comfortable and easy to put on they do not fall off and good in water

Width and length fit me just fine but the strap is too tight and is not adjustable I use these only for showering at the gym and for that purpose they are fine Overall I am satisfied I paid a low price with them being on sale

They are very comfortable I really like them and you can wear them after a shower or after a sport They are very nice I recommend them to anybody

i like this shoe it is VERY comfy it also looks very good i personally do not swim i use this before and after basketball and football

These are great slides I got th blue ones ive been complemented on how they look and they are real comfortable

great slide comfortable and great price My son wears them after football practice and loves them

I love the nike sandals the only thing is that you should order a size up or two Thats the only thing

takes a while to dry i recommend to only by one size up i bought mine two sizes up and its kinda loose when i wear them great buy though Nice slippers for a good price

good slippers Fun to use Very comfortable I am probably going to buy my brother a pair You can just walk around in them or use them for any after sport activity

These were for my 14 year old son Acually he wears a size 14 not 8 as listed above He loves them He wears them to school and also toand from school basketball games and said they are great and just what he was looking for I would recommend them to anyone looking at a pair of sliders for a reasonable price 99 9 of the shoes in my familyhouse are NIKE and we could not be happier with their products

These are great shoes Nice to wear after games etc Very comfortable The only thing is that you do not have the ability to make the shoe tighter so you have no choice as to how lose or tight it is on your foot Otherwise its a perfect fit

These were a gift for son in law he loves them HE BRAGS ON THE WORKMANSHIP HE IS ROUGH ON FOOT WEAR BUT THESE HOLD UP WELL

These shoes are great for when your done playing basketball and you want to relax your feet Or if you just wnt to walk around in the house in them

IF YOU WEAR A SIZE 9 ORDER A SIZE 10 OR 10 AND 1 2 BECAUSE THEY COME IN SMALL SIZES SINCE THEY DID NOT FIT ME I GAVE THEM TO MY MOM IDK WHAT SHE THINKS OF THEM I GUESS SHE WOULD SAY THEY are OK

I walked 6 miles first time I wore them and had no issues So that tells it all

Cushion is good but I need just a bit more for some old feet

After a year of wearing them they have started to separate between the fabric of the shoe and the bottom The rubber on the side that attaches to the fabric is starting to separate on both sides of the shoe on both feet

The bottom of the sneaker ripped after 3 weeks of use I would not recommend the sneaker to anyone who runs a lot They are very comfortable but not durable at all Look at the picture

These are not great running shoes but they are comfortable and easy on off They have the dumbest and worst tread design I have ever seen in any shoe let alone a running shoe Perhaps we are supposed to run indoorsSmall stones easily get lodged in the treads I just did 1 2 mile and had to pry out around 15 stones from each shoe They have a heel crunching sound indoors on laminate tile floors

The sock lining and soft heel make the shoe really comfortable Sole is pretty supple too

I have been wearing Free Runs for years and these were the worst ones I have worn as far as quality goes After about two months of normal use I had to replace the insoles because they wore down so quickly I have had these for less than six months total and the exterior of the back heel area is tearing on both shoes I only use these for casual activity so I do not understand how they could get so worn down so quickly Compared to Free Runs in the past the durability has not been even close to what it was I would definitely recommend investing in another shoe

I got this pair about less than a month ago and have enjoyed using it since I run exercise almost every day mostly focused on speed than duration and these shows feels like you are wearing nothing it is so light I cannot comment on its quality as it has not been long enough to measure that Overall definitely recommend these shows

Bought this couple of weeks ago I ordered US size 10 but it is way smaller than the usual US size 10 on the shoes it says US 10 UK 7 5 but the size chart claims that it should UK size 9 9 5 it is just kind of weird

Aight so first of all fit is great Comfortable running shoes as always But fam i bought this shoes about 2 to 3 weeks ago walked and ran a bit for about less than 10 miles in total Then guess what one of the round rubber at the bottom of the shoes straight up broke out Bad design or bad materialOnly weeks man Compare to my 2016 nike free which last for almost 2 years this is a little disappointment

I bought a black pair just six months ago and the sole has not endured even average wear I wear these mostly walking around the city seldom to the gym and the sole in each heel has worn down considerably faster than I would have expected

This version of the Free line feels too cushioned The reason I have worn the Free for the past eight years is because I needed a shoe that has a barefoot like feel I have worn the Nike Free 3 0 for training and racing because cushioned shoes are generally unstable and causes many of the injuries I have had These however feel like they have Zoom Air even though I know they do not If you are looking for a minimalist shoe that is close to being barefoot look elsewhere

Most comfortable shoes I have ever had Worn Nike Free RN for the past few years and these are the most comfortable I have had They have great support for running and CrossFit while also being comfortable enough to wear everyday They are very easy to clean and repel water very well

the constant squeaking is torture I have to put baby powder in the sole every two days

After a decade in NB trainers a 04mil rise and wide toe box I forgot why I do not normally wear Nike Too narrow and the other reviews were accurate size up I did not and I regret it A wider toe box for trainers should be a given The fact that there are no width options for such a popular shoe tells me these are for show not for serious trainers runners

Love these shoes but I really love to wear them without socks un fortunately whenever i remove them the insole from both shoes roles out with my foot and has to be replaced Was this an intentional part of the design

Overall great shoe but loses a star for average durability

this shoe is super sleek and comfortable very good cushioning and supportive feel definitely recommend going up half a size have not had them for that long so I can not speak on durability but for now they seem great

Great shoes Felt great right when I put it on I took the advice of other reviews and sized up Glad I did I normally need a wider shoe but so far these work I wish Nike would make more shoes available in wide or extra wide But so far very happy

This shoe was great from the minute I put it on I would definitely recommend going a half size up though they run a little small

I got the free and flex rn 2017 and they were very comfy and so were these My foot is very hard to feet because it is wide but these fit perfect and are very well cushioned Good job nike

I got these shoes back in April as a gift and they are great By far the best running shoes I have had However I have the white pair and have notice how the toe easily becomes dirty after going for a neighborhood run Do you or anybody have suggestions as how to clean the white pair

I used to own several pairs of the Nike 5 0 back around 2010 Best shoes ever Well now i thought these would be the same but i was definitely wrong They felt great the first 5 days But after that they began to lose collapse And at the 2 week mark it felt like all support was gone completely Well yesterday made 1 month since i bought them from Finish Line and my feet hurt constantly I will never buy another pair like these again

When I bought these shoes they were extremely comfortable and I would wear them for short periods of time with no issues Then I went on vacation and wore them all day at Disney after the first day I had blisters on my feet and by the end of the trip I could barely stand to wear them I only brought this pair of shoes on the trip and I wish I had not purchased them in the first place and wore my old Nike running shoes

Very comfortable shoe but would recommend going up at least one half size to a full size

I like how the back hugs my foot These are really comfortable and not fat like older shoes

Best and most comfortable Free yet Good for running working out or just hanging out Ended up buying a second pair in a different color

Awesome shoe Looks really cool Awesome comfortable footing but too small and not available in wide size or size 16 very bummed because it seems I would love this shoe if it fit me right

What a fantastic shoe a great improvement over last yearmodel stellar comfort plushier and yet still light weight and breathable do not pass on these shoes if you like Nike Free models

I Love the way these sneakers feel on my feet I will be buying another color

I have purchased a few different styles of the Nike Air Max in the past and I must say These are the most uncomfortable shoes I had to go up two sizes Colors are popping though

They fit true to size and can be worn with just about anything They are definitely worth it

These shoes I love them I am keep buying that is in all different colors

Great all around shoe good looks good value very comfortable

These shoes are so comfortable Can wear them all day long They do run a little small so I ordered a half size bigger than usually Fresh and comfortable what more can you ask for

I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them Very comfortable perfect fit and stylish

This style is amazing super comfortable I can wear them all day they are nice and snug The best part is that thier is so many different colors which I love This is my 5th pair iv bought in the last 6 months and I hope soon to buy some more soon thier is just so many to choose some I definitely recommend

I like the shoe because it is light weight and fits well on my feet The grip is Ok However due to it is small and tight opening it is hard to wear and take it off Also it is hard on the ankles The shoe is too narrow in the front so it looses it is compactness and grip that is the reason it is hard to run wearing this shoe for more than half an hour

The ankles killed me I had them on for 30 minutes and my feet got numb It would be dope if the ankle was adjustable via shoe strings Had to return them

These shoes are very comfortable when I am running and working out They feel really light like I have on just socks

After a few months a hole forms over the toe area This has happened to two pairs of my sons and one pair of mine Mine lasted about six months before they wore through My sons however less than three months Nike needs to put a little more effort into a 150 shoe

When I tried it on my feet felt like walking on a pillow Its so soft and comfy I used for walking and doing my exercise My feet never felt this great Awesome shoes Thumbs up Nike

Nicest shoes I have purchased in the past 6 months Not only do they look nice they are actually the perfect fit I am looking into purchasing different color ones

Great shoe I had a hard time getting them on at first with no tounge but now it is not a problem The only down side is the get very slick in the wet or I would give them 5 stars

I have 3 colorways of these They are very comfortable and stylish as well I am on my feet all day then I get an hour and a half of light work out in So far everything is positive I also get a lot of compliments with these

These are the best casual shoe available get some

The shoe looks good I got the original hot punch colorway with the light bone and black its a LITTLE NARROW nothing horrendous nike just needs to make them little wider just a little and the upper needs to be stretchier Other than that lovely shoe nice heel support great big fat air bubble sick styling love the hits of nike on the shoe really nice looking really the 2nd iteration should be better when and if I would buy again and shoe loosens up after a little wear

I can wear these all day and all night I am a fan of the Nike Air all different styles I wish they had more color choices that were not so bright or dull but my kid loves the red ones but a 50 old man cannot pull those off

I am womensize 9 but I bought the mensize 8 because I loved the menbright colors better I bought the Volt Black pair I get so many compliments on these shoes and they are super comfortable This is my new favorite summer shoe

Love these shoes A lot I want 3 colors in these shoes now

So comfortable i could wear them all day the new colors keep getting better

They are so nice I bought them twice Took them for a true test drive in Manhattan and I was completely comfortable Might get another pair

I bought the original 003 color way The kicks are very comfortable You can feel the cushioning with every step I wore them once today for the course of the day and my foot did not feel super relieved after taking them off one would feel after wearing uncomfortable shoes Stick to your size when buying these and you will be fine I can get away with wearing a 10 5 but I am very happy with my 11 because that is my sizeif that helps you decide between your two sizes

this shoe low key is firee and i will buy another pair and my mom

Received the shoes as a gift did not do anything too crazy with them just walk to class and occasionally wear them to work I work indoors in a gym The shoes were comfortable while they lasted after about a month the sides of the shoes RIPPED as they are cheap thin material Overall disappointing Really liked these shoes got a lot of compliments just upsetting that the quality was so poor would not recommend

If they had made it a separate piece or if the tongue material could stretch horizontally just a bit these would be great

I like my 270Very comfortable shoe to walk around in My only complaint is the shoe opening is narrow and not that stretchy elastic material Neoprene sleeve that is used on most shoes like my Nike Huarache If the opening was made like that it would be so much better

From heal to toe size is fine Although runs very narrow The middle of my foot seems to be coming over the top of the sole inside my feet Casual walking use so no big deal but be aware runs very narrow

The 270 really is a great sneaker The giant air bag in the heel really adds some support and the insoles are comfortable as well The mesh on the upper is very breathable due to its ventilation The fit is just fine but may pose an issue for those who have wider feet If you are looking to wear this sneaker casually i believe you will love it HOWEVER I truly do not feel this is a performance based sneaker This is more of an athletic lifestyle look I do not foresee the materials on these holding up well with running outdoors or even indoors I wear these sneakers to work and to the gym I do not run in these and i do NOT recommend you squat or deadlift wearing these either My best advice to anyone who wants these is to wear them casually because I do not see these lasting with some exercises I wish Nike would put more emphasis on which sneakers are more performance based and which are more of aathletic lifestyle look and feel Other than that these are great sneakers

I bought this 2 weeks back and the Midsole of the shoe is has cracks and bruise

I take very good care of my shoes and thought I might be one of the only people this happened to After reading the reviews I am not the only person who has had this problem I had a hole on both left and right shoe develop right over the pinky toe about 4 months after purchase Super disappointed with the quality especially after price paid

I like the shoes but they need more shoes with wide options I bought a half size bigger to compensate for how narrow these run other than that these are great cross trainers I do a lot of jump roping and my feet feel great after words

I have bought three pairs of this model so it seems obvious like it I think it is a great lifestyle shoe and good for working out but not good for running or doing cardio exercise By that I mean it is okay to wear if you are lifting weights but not for running or using on cardio machines I have gotten a lot of compliments on the style

This shoe rocks I can not believe how good they feel on my feet 12 10 would buy again

Amazing I recommend this to all my friends Great shoe

Let me start by saying the design of the shoe is visually appealing It is a decent looking shoe That being said if you have any arch in your foot whatsoever getting the shoe on is a pain at best impossible at worst The design of the tongue attached to the sock of the shoe does not allow the tongue to be pulled back enough to comfortably slip the shoe on for anyone with a medium to high arch I purchased one size up as I usually do with Nike shoes I could not slip my foot in because the tongue did not move Buyer beware

I received these shoes for Christmas 2018 so my review is only a few days old According to my health app I have worn them for approximately 20 miles both walking and running The shoes are very comfortable and fit true to size The sock tongue is something that I am getting accustomed to as I have been a ASICS customer for many years So far so great I am hoping to get another pair in the near future for closest turnover I plan to use them for both workout and casual wear

I got these shoes just a few weeks ago and they look even better in person than advertised I got the university red and for semi white shoes they are holding up very well With any white shoe they are going to eventually stain and these shoes are no exception The shoes also take a little time to break into but once they are worn a few days you should be good A final tip would be for people with low arches these shoes have more upper space than needed for flat footed people which can for some create top creases on the inner side of the shoe this pair is subject to this small inconvenience Look great in person comfortable stylish and awesome shoes by nike

These shoes are junk At first I thought my son was just not talking care of them He wore a hole in not one pair but two pairs of these shoes The hole forms over the toe My shoes now have done the same thing I take very good care of mine they are 3 4 months old Nike needs to take care of this Reading the reviews I am not the only one this has happened to

They are not workout shoes notice they are not listed as running or training shoes but they are good for leisure They are comfortable for casual wear The heel is too high to workout in But I have seen people do it anyway You should be fine if you are lifting weights and not doing any lateral movements

Nice looks awesome fit I have a very wide flat foot and these actually fit a size smaller than i usually wear Great shoe for the price

do not buy these looking to run they hurt your ankles

I bought these shoes before the school year started thinking I would have a nice pair of shoes to last me through the year This was not the case After only two weeks of wearing them the sole started to peel off and a hole formed in the toe Horrible durability do not waste your money

As a previous reviewer stated these do run small I am not sure if it is a full half size too small could be 1 8th which is weird This color way metallic silver electric blue is smaller than my White White Persian Violet Dark Grey For a shoe this price you expect some continuity in sizing I have been having the same problem with the Air Max 1 PremiumI recently had to return some size 13in black because they felt like they were size 11 I have some grey ones that fit a little snug but definitely not true to size too and some canvas ones that are somewhere in between the first two Really scratching my head here Nike The other thing that I disliked about the 270is there is a really silly looking fold crease that is pronounced and pops out from the arch when you put weight on the foot Unfortunately I will be returning the metallic silver electric blue and keep the other ones that fit better because I got them at a good enough discount that I can warrant the few issues I am experiencing Due to the lack of consistent sizing with Nike as of lately I hate to say that I am going to stop buying fro them online and only buy their shoes that I can try on in the stores More of my business will go with my other favorite brands that have a more consistent sizing model

Let me start by saying I love nikes I am so mad I am late to these i purchased a pair today for myself and my son at the store I logged on looking for the black pair with the white check the man in the store was supuer helpful I am even more amazed that you can design your own colors OMG I am going to take my time and make my own pair thanks NIKE

I bought this shoe because I have heard raving reviews of it and because I thought it looked awesome And it for sure looks awesome but comfort is a different story

My son got these at the end of the school year He had older shoes that he has worn most of the summer so these have hardly been worn He came home today and said that when he was squatting the shoe ripped On one side of his right foot the fabric part has just started completing ripping away from the sole all in one piece Very disappointing especially with the cost of these shoes Other than that he has liked them

I got a pair of these they are really comfortable and look nice but the air bubble seems to be getting scratches scuffs on it and I do not know how to get them off

Nike did another great job with these sneakers I did not that they would be as comfortable as they are because I only purchased because I like the silhouette Unbeknownst to me these are extremely comfortable and easy on the eyes

These are narrow so I purchased an 11

Absolute trash I bought the white ones and wore them 2x and the mesh is stained from the dirt in the air live on dirt road I sure hope Nike resolves this issue

I love these shoes They look fantastic there pretty comfortable in general but they are a little expensive for just looking great

I absolutely love the look but I work at a job where I have to stand all day and they absolutely kill my feet I bought them about a week ago and have worn them a good amount for work all week and to even go out with friends to do things I am very active and these are not as comfortable as you expect them to be

These are great lifestyle shoes been wearing both my pairs a lot Very comfy and i really like the giant bubble aesthetically its really very cool and different I think Nikebeen doing great with the different colorways Now ive read some reviews about durabilty ive been using mine casually exclusively maybe thats its holding up

These are fairly comfortable I have flat feet so no shoe is comfortable long I wear them daily I have had them for 2 months now and they have developed a loud squeaky noise when I walk I can not sneak up on anything while wearing these shoes They are so loud it is embarrassing At least they look great

In most of the Nike Jordan basketball related shoes though I am a TTS 12 So definitely go a half size up if you are borderline

I would up copping the hyper grape Laker nation 270 and could not be more stoked on the comfort it gives my feet By far would recommend these in all the colorways offered up here 5 plus 1thatswooshlife

I looooooveeee them shoes They are comfortable and nice

First off I have purchased Nike religiously for over the last 20 years and I have always been happy with the quality the 270 I purchased were amazing for a week then the toe part ripped open and the back air bubble peeled i hope to hear back about this issue to regain confidence

I must say that this sneaker hits all the right marks for me Fashionable trendy comfortable but the opening of the shoe is too tight They are almost impossible for someone with a high bridge on their foot to squeeze into This is one of the reasons I tend to stay away from sneakers without the traditional tounge but I would say these are almost like KD9in that they barely open to squeeze your foot in I spend approximately 10 15 minutes trying to put them on After i am done spraying WD40 all on my foot so that I slide in them they feel great I purchased them in the dusty cactus the triple white and while they are not that bad the volt ones i recently purchased are extra difficult to slide into I am not sure if i just received a pair that maybe runs tighter but I can not do it to myself Unfortunately i have to return them

I who the air pocket is new but over time the pocket would decrease on air when you buy them I have two pairs and the first pair on felt nice but over time it was decreasing on air I went out to buy new one and after one from buying them you could feel the different on the shoes because they do not feel the same when you with a strong air pocket But over all the shoes feel great but i just what them to fix that amountof air that go into them

Light weight great cushion and style One of my favorite releases this year I always get comments on this shoe when walking around

These are great looking and comfortable shoes as far as looks go and walking with that large air bag However if you have bigger and wider feetyou may want to go to a store and try them on first as they are quite snug due to them being one piece a sock like design I have had mine about 2 weeks and have been wearing them around the house to break them in While they have stretched out a little bit they are still pretty snug feeling and my feet start to hurt after a few hours from how tight they are I am still on the fence if I am going to send them back because I really like them a lot They are comfortable though for standing walking running etc for support and they look great so you will not be disappointedbut I would try them on first if you are around a size 11 and up With them being as snug as they are I may had passed had I put them on first

I had to wait awhile till the dusty cactus colorway dropped but it was worth the wait it is been my go to work shoe I stand all day at work and these really take the fatigue out of my heel after a long day The forefoot foam is great They look great on foot in my scrubs or when I wear them out and about You guys keep the hot colors coming and I will keep picking them up

I was initially worried about purchasing these due to some of the negative feedback and reviews but these are easily one of the best air maxNike has ever produced IMO and I have been a faithful air max buyer since the 97first came out over 20 years ago They are super light weight and I love the shoe strings and the way the tighten up unlike any other shoe I have had Had to score the Dusty Cactus color off another site though Only negative I have is the availability of some of the more popular colors simply is not there

Great shoe I bought mine almost 2 months ago and i had no problem First time i put them on it felt snug near the tongue area but it just needs to be worn to get used to I got the hyper magenta colorway and its straight fire

When the shoe came out I was unsure about its look It grew on me Bought the black pair Looked great when it came in the mail After wearing them though it unfortunately feels like the shoe is pushing my foot forward The back of the shoe seems so high that my foot slides forward Bummed cuz I like the look Not sure if I will return them Might work for casual wear but not for working out Hoped the shoe would work for both workouts and casual wear

Shoes run extremely narrow Also the front of the foot feels as if it has little to no padding Shoe also looks like it is ready to fall apart very cheaply made

I love the way these shoes fit and the support they provide but the one piece tongue rubs against the top of my ankle lower shin area and causes it to rub against them causing irritation and a small blister Does anyone else have this problemI would be shocked if no one else is encountering this issue the tongue Any insight from Nike would be helpful thx

I received my shoes today and just love the way they fit very comfortable

Overall I was pleased with the shoe I chose the Olive Black pair size 11 fits well not to narrow and not to wide I am not completely sold I will try these for the 30 days and see how they hold up Also not enough blue color that sold out too fast

Bought these for my girlfriend this is our 5th pair of 270 between us awesome great looking shoe with jeans or shorts Weird sizing trying to figure out women to men conversion she is a 8 8 5 in women so I bought it In a 7 5 to be on the safe side and they came out perfect

Great looking shoe and super comfortable Try on in store if you can though because depending on how you like your shoes to fit they are not necessarily true to size I wear a US 6 5 in Men8 in Womenbut these run pretty narrow and were too tight on my feet so I had to go up a half size

These are great sneakers Very comfortable I was worried about the size and fit because of my wide feet sometimes things just do not look right or fit right But not with these I am normally a 6 5 in boywhich is a 8 in womenI purchased womensize 8 5 and a mensize 7 Only because my actual size was a little tightwhereas going up a half a size was just right I only say they run true to size for those without wide feet So to my wide feet friends go for it

These shoes look amazing in my opinion I got the dusty cactus and they look super dope From the reviews I saw that people with wide feet did not like the fit and personally I have really wide feet but I think they shoes fit pretty well The mid foot area is a bit snug but I kind of like it and it does not bother too much They slip on easy too which was surprising because usually I struggle putting on some NikeI think this is a step in the right direction but I too hope they make more shoes wide foot friendly

To anyone who wants to buy the black hot punch ones i though they were red they are BRIGHT pink like neon pink I like the pink but just for anyone who thought the same as me they are really comfortable though i love them

I love the look but this shoe is not for everyone Not a good shoe if you have a wide foot Other than that Very nice shoe

I would buy some but you do not offer them for people with wide feet 3E

I just received the shoes from Nike Right out of the box they look fantastic The finish of the whole shoe is clean and striking The lip is built into the shoe and I used the loop on the back and each foot slid right in What is most important to me is how comforable they are They wrap the feet perfectly and the air support makes the walk very light and bouyant Bottom line they feel great I think if you like Nike and have been happy with their shoes in the past then these will absolutely not disappoint

As a members plus meber and as a nike stock holder I recommend nike stop making narrow shoes and shoes with clear bottom soles that will yellow within 4 5 months These shoes like most of nike products in the last three years are hype I recommend ultra boost worth the money Nike try

Sneakers arrived today and they looked pretty good But very very disappointed with the fit

Gorgeous shoes Make them in University Red Black

This shoe is really cool looking I wanted to like it However after wearing them for 8 hours my right foot started to hurt especially at the toe area The other shoe feels fine Also I know shoes need to be broken in but this shoe is EXTREMELY stiff Makes me not want to wear them anymore

I was extra hype for this shoes and colorway to release I love the design and the 270 air bubble Very comfortable True to size Will buy the other colorways asap

I saw these advertised on social media and loved the aesthetic so I splurged Having owned many pairs of Nikes these ran true to size and I knew I would not be returning The sole takes a little getting used to especially if you have traditionally worn a flatter shoe but it is super light and comfortable Only feedback is they are definitely airy if you are using them in cold weather you may want to consider heavier socks

I normally do not purchase nike shoes because I am a huge fan of adidas but I saw this shoe in the store and fell in love with the overall look of it and the comfort it provided

This is actually the first pair of Nike that I am buying What convinced me to make the purchase was the aesthetics of foot wear When it arrived it looked pretty much like advertised I also like how comfortable it feels even after having them on for extended periods of time I still have my reservations about its durability since I have had it for barely a week but I strongly hope it meets my expectation because I would like to stick with Nike

This shoe is a great balance between comfort aesthetics stability breathability and durability I have the light bone hot punch colorway and it is definitely a shoe that I could wear for extended periods of time That air max bubble in the heel is something that needs to be felt in a lifetime

Extremely comfortable shoe I bought it before a trip and it served me well I will continue to wear it for a long time

Sneaker has great fit and really comfortable Very happy with the purchase

REALLY LIKED THESE SHOES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE NIKE AIR FORCE ONE BRAND STYLE ONCE I PUT THEM ON MY FEET I WAS IN HEAVEN TOTALLY COMFORTABLE THE STYLE IS RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME BEEN BUYING JORDANS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST ALL WHITE IN A CASUAL STYLE

It feals like im walking on babby ducks

Crisp clean shoe I really enjoyed wearing them An excellent fit for my style

I am very satisfied with this purchase Great deal

you just gotta be careful the white ones cause them hoes will get dirty if you are not cautious

My grandson loves them and would like them in black soon

Looks great and comfortable to wear casually Able to wear it to work with pants or jeans and it looks clean with a dress shirt orshirt Decent price and now it looks like the price has gone down further and with free shipping wish I could get my money back for that difference Good shoes would recommend

Lightweight shoe that does not crease Very stylish great on jeans Comfortable true to size A must have casual shoe no cons Pure white fresh look A def to have

I am not a huge fan of lows in general but I like the color of these shoes The color online is true to what they are in person I was looking for something a bit different and this was it for me They definitely add a pop to any outfit Just be careful since this jade color does not exactly match with everything The plus is that it is not hard esp during summer to find close that have the same jade vibe and match perfectly All things considered especially the price point solid buy

Bought these for my boyfriend as a five year anniversary present Initially we spotted them in a Ch and s shoe store but they did not have his size We went to footlocker and they did not even have the shoe Luckily I googled the shoes and found them online at Finishline They arrived within a few days and he absolutely loves the shoes Every detail to the red interior the suede and smooth leather the gray Nike logo is absolutely beautiful

I have worn for about a week self only and the leather is actually peeling off already it is the crease on the inside of the shoe that causes the leather to bubble I am hoping to return do a new pair

Great price and very comfortable and a great quality

My Son is 18 likes the OG look These shoes are great with jeans shorts and sweats Retro 1 will never go out of style Wish they come in dark blue

returned the shoe found another shoe I liked better

Brought them because they are my favorite color so I could not resist

Bought these for my hubby for his birthday and he was very happy Must have shoes for a stylish man

Not extremely comfortable I bought them as a pair to just run around town in to do errands and casual occasions They are not highly comfortable I would not recommend wearing these all day The cushion in minimal at best If you want some low top classic Jthat is what you are going to get If you want to use them for basketball get a better pair

I have always like the AJ1 I have about 5 pairs of them and this is my first low top I like the feel and its a really nice comfortable pair of kicks Get you some

Purchased the all white ones and they have been my favorite pair of shoes ever since Only break them out every once and a while but when I do everyone seems to notice

You can not go wrong with triple black JordanThey are very comfortable and sporty

Reminds me of when I was a kid and had the OGs Cool color way of one of iconic shoes of all time

For those that would like to tie shoelaces pls check before leaving store I purchased and wore out of store without tying laces Later I decided to and noticed that once shoelace was much longer than the other which could tie easily The shorter one I could not tie so had to go out and purchase new ones Big pain in the backside

They wear really well I could not be happier with my purchase they are roomy and airy so no of that sweaty feet problem this is my 3 pair so they must be doing something right

The Jordan 1 was made before shoes were made to be extra comfortable They look good and get compliments so I am cool with it

These Jordan1 low are a must if you like high quality shoes the look and feel of these Jordanwill last

These shoes are really nice and I love them but the colors are not as rich as they appear in the pictures on the computer screens at times I bought the Insignia blue colored ones and the green did not even appear visible in the picture but the green is more defined in person It is not too much of a difference that I would not purchase these shoes but it is a visible difference Just pay attention carefully to the pictures and descriptions before you make the purchase

The right shoe is chafing on the back of my ankle To fix this I need to wear calf socks or a bandaid with no show socks Totally worth it though it looks that good

Jordan 1s are always a must have to add to your kicks collection Unique because most collectors overlook these classics due to them being lo top If you collect Js I totally recommend these

I would recommend not only the shoes but the whole shopping experience Prices and product are always top notch and I even got the shoes faster than predicted

This actually worth the 100 but I normally wait for some of the color to drop to 70 Now I end up with 4 of these I will just keep on waiting for it since these are hot shoes that almost like AF1 Will always be available every year

I ordered a pair of the 553558 402 Sport Blue Wolf Grey Black If you look at the picture the Sport Blue seems to be a light blue sky blue When I got the pair of shoes the style on the paper apparently matches up but the color is much darker than the picture I was expecting a lighter blue like in the picture but it was a very dark blue Like dark blue jeans they are nice shoes but just kinda confused why the color is completely differentAm I colorblind

I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for day and he absolutely love them He wants 3 or 4 more pair of them in different colors

I purchased these in the black grey red colorway as a gift to my cousin this past Christmas He was very pleased with them and has not given me any complaints In past experience retro 1usually run small so I ordered a half size up to prevent them from being too small

I love my Nike shoes They are so comfortable and great for running They provide the perfect comfort and stability I need while running short distances around the trails and neighborhoods I live by The style also provides for an awesome look when wearing casual wear and I will definitely buy this style again 

I bought this product for my son and it lives up to the quality and value that I expect from Air Jordan and Finish Line

I personally always go down 5 size in AJ1s and these fit perfectly This shoe looks so good with shorts or with cuffed pants Definitely recommend

Love this shoe But I have one issue why do not they make this style in size 12 512 is slightly too small and 13 make me look like a clown I am 5 Very disappointed but hopefully the next version of this style will have the 12 5

I ordered these shoes about 3 months ago expecting the main color to be brown but was disappointed the they were mainly green Because of that I rarely wear them and when i do it is to go to my work office After mild use one of the shoes ripped now randomly on the sides I have several nike shoes for all purposes nothing like this has ever happened

The shoe is great great design and excellent shipping

I have had these shoes over a month and nothing I have tried can make them quiet A little noise hear and there would be fine but these things are loud with every step Not happy with this considering how much I paid

Got the all white sneaks knowing they had be hard to clean but I did not expect that to be from my own blood The tab on the back of these shoes digs into my heel Within a day I was bleeding all over these sneakers The only way I can wear them is with band aids on the back of my ankles

I run twice a week usually about 3 4 miles each time These shoes are great for that kind of run I prefer the lunarlon technology to some of the air maxes The flynit is breathable Even great for walking

These shoes were some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned They had one flaw and that was the amount of support they gave your foot was very minimal One day I was out running and my foot caught on something and rolled I had fractured my 5th metatarsal because of them

You would think the whole shoe throughout would be a PURE white like the midsole of the shoe and how the pictures show But once you see these in person you will be sorely disappointed The white on the flyknit it NOT a pure white It is barely even a white it is more of an easter green silver MAYBE in the dark you might not notice but these are a bright summer shoe made to be worn in the daylight I LOVED how this shoe looked in Nikepictures and could not wait to get my hands on them and now I am contemplating whether I should even keep them or not

These shoes are very comfortable I was in the market for a new running shoe and these were recommended to me by a friend Very content with my purchase I just had my first run with them and did 4 miles and it felt great The one minor annoyance about this shoe is that if you are someone who likes to trail run the tiny pebbles will get stuck in the small creases on the sole I tried to pick them out with a toothpick after my run but realized that it does not effect the shoe in anyway and that it is not worth my time to try to remove them Just a bit annoying Other than that a really great shoe overall for the price I paid Would recommend

I have never worn a shoe that was so tight around the ankle It is a struggle to get them on my feet and I definitely have slim ankles I should have sized up at least two full sizes After 30 minutes of jump rope I could not feel my toes

Easily the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn Great cushioning when running and such a pleasure to wear once you get out of some football boots Although the lacing system did not ensure a tight fit around the balls of my foot i barely noticed once i got into my stride

Would definitely recommend the Flyknit trainers as they are super comfortable and the knit is really beautiful up close I purchased the Oreo pair and love the look and contrast of the black and white

By far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Only downside is pebbles get caught in the bottoms of the shoes but does not even matter in the end I would highly recommend this product

it is a little bit too narrow if you have wide feet this may be a bit weird but it will do Overall very comfortable Durability is not as good as I hoped but they endured daily use

Love the look of the shoe Not that comfortable and the flyknit isnt super soft

I will start by saying the good partsthe flyknit is awesome its lightweight and they have a great selection of coloways

These shoes run really narrow Even after wearing them for a few weeks hoping they would stretch out they never did The shoe also does not feel that if offers any ankle support and rubs the back of the heel uncomfortable when using to walk By the end of 1 mile I could barely walk in them

Great seeming shoe Lightweight good for summer since it is relatively breathable and all that but the heel feels like it is about 1 2 an inch tall because it slips off my heel a ton and practically slips so far that it falls underneath my heel I laced them up super tight to try to fix it but 1 it did not work and 2 I would not want to wear my shoes like that anyways

Very comfortable feels a nice cushion on your feet especially heels backheeels One thing that Nike may improve here is their durability in rain or water They will start soaking water as soon as come in contact with it and will hold it which feels terrible on your feet Another suggestion would be to make front part a bit wider Even though the mesh keeps is cool I personally like some air flow or specifically some open space near my toes These shoes hug my entire foot which is OK except the lack of air space it leaves near toes My Brooks Adrenaline GTS do a fantastic job with keeping my toes cool

This is an amazing shoe Looks cool and feels very soft and comfy It is a bit narrow so you may want to order a half size bigger I am so happy I bought this shoe I bought this not for running I wear it as an everyday shoe and it is amazing Highly recommend it Looks really cool too

I have tried so many fitness shoes trying to accommodate my high instep and narrow foot These are a dream I wear a 9 5 in most shoes however I always size up for running shoes I got these in a 10 to give my socks room I wear these for cardio They hug my feet support my arch and are my most favorite Nikes yet I snagged them on sale too If you have a wide foot I imagine they might be more difficult to get on as the ankle opening is pretty snug

I have been wearing lunar series since 2013 and this model is great as I expected These have great support on my heels and the sole I would definitely recommend this model and I am looking forward to upcoming lunar series

I have been running in Nike Frees for about 5 years now My calf has been giving me some grief lately and I noticed when I run on packed dirt it is less painful When I wore out my Nike Frees I was looking to get another pair But the reviews for the Nike Free RN 2017 are awful I knew these had more cushion so I went for them And I am glad I did My first run was great Faster than my normal pace and not a peep from my calf Very surprised a shoe could make that much of a difference

Durability is great Im at 500 miles and the shoes physically look great one wash and you would never tell they have the mileage on them granted my runs are done primarily on road At 500 miles their cushion is no longer good enough for running but still have plenty of life left for walks or trials They also encourage great foot roll and ground strike

This shoe is Very comfortable The shoe has very good support Like the neutral color

After trying different Nike models and some other brands I think I found the best fitted comfortable cushioned and lightest running shoes in the market I have ran over 40 miles with them and still feel like running in the clouds I will keep buying lunarepic low flyknit 2

The Color On This Shoe Is Not That Bright it is More Of A Dark Mustard I Was Very Dissapointed Because i Actually Love This Shoe All Around Great Comfortable Show But The Color Is Not Right and Described Correctly or Displayed Correctly

They breathe really well They are not the most comfortable pair of nike shoes i have bought but they are pretty darn close

I love this shoe better than any other I have used If you like a shoe with soft cushioning this one is for you It may feel tight at first but after one or two runs it fits like a glove and comfortable

I recommend this shoes I probably buy another pair because I go thru them so fast wish the sole lasted longer

I tried these shoes on and knew I had to have them They are very comfortable and have a pillowy featherlight feel With the flyknit material they are very light

This is my 4th pair of lunarepics and I am very disappointed with the quality of the flyknit The coat used to make the flyknit harder around the toes seems to be flaking off these shoes are have only been worn about 8 times

Extremely comfortable the most comfortable pair of shoes ive ever bought Its like walking running on air

Very comfortable shoe fits great looks great Not too narrow Tried the flyknit racer but that shoe felt more narrow this one feels better around the toes

I really wanted to like these shoesthey look great with super cool soles and beautiful use of knit construction

The shoes run true to size in length but are narrow along the foot owing to the socklike upper This is shocking at first if you are unused to it but the upper does give some over time The heel cup does run a little narrow and the insert will shift so it is important that you place the insert where it feels best on the heel before break in and take care to keep it there to maximize the comfort of the shoe over time

These shoes are without a doubt the most comfortable pair of shoes i have ever owned It was the simplistic style that first caught my eye and the cool coloring but when i finally tried them on it was like walking on a cloud The flynit top hugs your foot like a cozy sock its breathable and very stylish looking and the lunar foam bottom is so soft and cushiony you wont want to take them off I will buy def buy a 2nd pair Totally worth the price great job Nike

I have been running in the same Nike Free 5 0 for the past 3 yearsand finally bought a new pair Very comparable to Ultra Boost but better because they are more firm so on longer runs your feet do not get sore because they are TOO soft I ran my usual 7 5km circuit in record time 33 4 mins without stopping once and I have only done that twice So far I am in love with them

These are the first pair of shoes that I would consider buying another pair of They are comfy Ive had mine for around a month and its still in great condition and are still pretty clean I have had no issues with these shoes so far

This is very comfortable and good looking shoe for runing and also for casual wear Its worth buying

Love the responsiveness flexibility and durability Feels like running on top of clouds Very soft yet snug and protects your feet from the constant pounding on the road

I work at retail and stand all day bought this shoe to help because it looked comfortable After 7 months my heels started hurting again Seems like the soles weakened or my feet got wider The shoe does seem narrow on the heel part

These shoes are amazing in every aspect I love that they fit so well to my foot like a sock I also love that they are so cushiony on the inside when I have them on All around these shoes are amazing

Got these really nice shoes yesterday and man the cushion is crazy Best I have ever felt Love these shoes

Inserts are cheap Mine shifted to one side during my walk Again never had that with any other shoe

I have somewhat wide flat feet but I have run races up to half marathons in Nike Flyknit Lunar 3s I loved them so much I bought 3 pairs Those shoes are discontinued so I was told the Lunarepics were the successor Ordered my usual size of 9 5 and when I tried them on they just felt too tight in the mid area of the foot Normally I would tough it out and do a couple runs to see if the knit stretches but my feet were hurting so much after the first run that I had to return them I know Nike doesnt do wide sizing but it was nice to actually have stylish shoe that fit my feet If the mid area was expanded just a little bit I probably wouldve kept the shoe and wore them until the material stretched to a comfortable fit

I just ordered my second pair of the Lunar Epic 2 just to make sure I have an extra pair Eliminating the tongue and making it a single piece shoe has gotten rid of all the hot spots I have had to grow used to This is by far the most comfortable runnning shoe I have ever had They fit like a glove with even pressure across my entire foot The flyknit upper breaths well so my feet do not overheat The flexibility and cushioning is just what right for me I have only been running in them for about a month so can not comment on durability but I doubt that will be an issue

Very comfortable and lightweight I had the first version of this sneaker which was also very comfortable and lightweight but this completely tops those Very breathable too The new sock like fit is much better than the old fit They also look better in my opinion

I liked that in this incarnation Nike removed the tongue I also like the fit and style However after about 15 runs I was tightening the laces and two of the flywire loops that hold the laces broke I own a couple more pairs and hope this does not repeat itself The upper is in great shape

I have worn this shoe for one week and they are still in great condition I run about 2 4 times around my block and my only concern it that dirt and pebbles get stuck on the side and bottom of the shoe indents These shoes are very comfortable and would definitely buy again

The shoes are very soft light weight and comfortable I feel very satisfied to buy them

Thees are the most comfortable shoes i have ever walked in The soles are really soft and springy Walked around spain over pavement cobbled stone and dirt for two weeks and my feet were never sore or achy The upper knitting is a little tight for my liking wore them without socks perfect fit and kept my feet cool Bought these at another site lower price

While it may look like these shoes have a red orange color on them that is not the case The images online are deceiving These shoes are bright pink If you are a male that likes pink on your shoes then these are for you

My normal running shoes are the Pegasus 33 but I wanted to try these for easy runs The first thing you notice is that these fit very tight I tried a half size larger than normal and the ankle area was still extremely tight These also seemed less stable than the Pegasus too probably be cause it has a more narrow outsole Shoes themselves look great but I will be sticking with the Pegasus for now

Only complaint is the tread olds small rocks Hard to remove

I hope someone finds this review useful I run 30 miles and I am training for Marine Corps Marathon I have been always running with shoes that has been recommend to me by different local runners stores in DC according to my stride etc I decided to change and buy a Nike runnings shoes after attending NRC events I wanted to try something lighter and maybe faster And hey the shoes look super nice

I do not know why I bought these shoes I cant even walk around in these the amount of pebbles that get caught in them is crazy Will never by a pair of nikes with this sole ever again

Sock with a Sole Get it Somewhat tighter fit and small foot box so maybe size upJust Buy them

Used these for casual wear and I was amazed Forgot it was a actual running shoe Try on in store first for best fit but after that enjoy Softest shoe I have worn

After being sidelined following a couple knee surgeries I had pretty much given up on being able to run pain free These shoes changed everything The cushion and light weight design of these has me running again at a similar pace to my pre injury self Thank you Nike for making these shoes could not be happier to be back running with friends and pushing my limits

They crease on the front portion very easy and the mudguard has very thin not good lasting quality for this price I have worn twice and they are pealing already and had very small scratches on the back of them once taken out of box but not very noticeable so I kept them

After I own many of running shoes I found this Lunar Epic is quiet different The upper is the best flyknit I ever tried and wrap the foot better than the new Free RN Motion Flyknit 2017 but the most surprising thing is midsole it softer than my Vomero12 except bouncing feels With the curve outsole make it freely move and change direction during running easier I cant tell so much about durable because I need more time to test it but this Lunar Epic now becomes my most favorite running shoes

I just received the Nike Air Max 90 Premium today and I have to say I love the design of this said shoe If you have owned Air Max 90before then you know the fit of the shoe which is comfortable to say the least However I noticed that the leather on the mudguard and laces seems cheap It looks like it was worn out already and there seems to be some glue on the shoe as well I thought about getting an exchange but I feel this is just an issue with the material and a different pair may have the same problem I still think it is a good purchase but just beware

Taking the price into account a huge disappointment

Whenever a running shoe is released it happensfolks write in saying The shoe runs too narrow or I do not have enough toe splay or something along those lines Well I have got words for yougo find another shoe If you like shoes that fit like a glove like a training version of your racing spikes with enough cushioning and support for a good 13 mile training run look no morepull out your credit card and grab these They are perfect For the love of all that is holy Nike please ignore the Make the standard version of this shoe wider crowd and send them to one of your other models Regular to narrow feet runners uniteSpeedKillsTheseShoesRock

I originally bought a pair of LunarTempos but the traction did not last so i returned them and ended up getting these Fits great a little snug at first but that is what you get with flyknit I like the no tongue silhouette and the bottom traction pods Would totally get another pair

Beautiful looking shoe Get lots of compliments on them Really padded sole that gives a very comfortable feeling My only complaint is that the heel feels very blunt definitely does not conform to the heel so there is a little slip in that area Also the shoe seems to keep your weight back on the heel I really enjoy the shoes and they are more comfortable then 95 of all other shoes I have tried True to size but a little more narrow then others I have only had the shoes for about a week so I cannot speak to their durability If like any of my other nikes Im sure these will last a long time Certainly recommend these shoes

these shoes are wonderful i had bought them after reading watching multiple reviews on them the support is unmatched at first they were a little hard to put on too tight but after a while of breaking them in they feel great even with socks not to mention they also look pretty cool i would definitely reccomend these to anyone looking to buy them

One tip to get them comfortable is to loosen the laces a lot before putting them on Then do not tighten the laces much just enough to take up the slack This solved the issue I was having with the tightness and akward fit in the heel

Best ever I really recommend taking out the laces Super cushiony and durable

I do not recommend this shoe if you have a wide foot like myself I bought these shoes in the same size as all of my others and it hurt just to put on The shoe was perfect length but it was extremely narrow and I could not wear it without having my foot cr and ed and hanging off of the out sole

Not what I am used to in a Nike shoe Not stable and very narrow I have a relatively small foot 7 purchased size 8 5 as I do with other Nike shoes My foot feels as though it is bigger than the toe box It feels as if my toes are outside of the insole The upper is very comfortable sock like but the shoe is so narrow every move of the shoe is felt in the foot and ankle

Had the Free 5 0 for a year or so and had the Free 3 0 for a couple years before that Both were getting beat up decided to go with the latest Nike Running Casual shoe Big mistake these shoes are a let down All the Nike Freeseem to have a normal american cut but this shoe has a very narrow cut I have had tons of shoes before but this is the first one that has not fit well because it is too narrow Made me wonder for a second if I had wide feet but it is the shoe Break in occurs after about 30 minutes you feel the flyknit loosen a little conform better but that does not change the width I wear size 10 5 for most shoes Nike FreeI wear 11 These shoes I got 11 and the length is fine but side walls and toe box area are too tight Makes for a constricted feel not in a good way In terms of comfort Nike 3 0 were by far the most comfortable like you were walking on clouds then Nike 5 0 was less comfortable more like a normal running sneaker Lunarepic Lows are this awkward shoe where you feel like you are walking on heels and only the hot spots of the sole are comfortable where the lunar lawn is yet the shoe almost like rocks around it is just a weird and unnecessary design It might be good for running if you have perfect form heel and toe land in perfect flat successionbut otherwise it is awkward and uncomfortable Not a good casual shoe I would recommend one of their more normal shoes at the very least to get rid of the massive sole which makes it feel like you have heels on

You feel like you are walking on the clouds when you wear this shoe for the first time This is a great shoe for running or walking

I am not sure what is going on with the fit of Nikes at least on my feet I have tried many Nike SB shoes that are 2 tight My foot is a 9 5 medium width but I have to buy a 10 shoe and even had to go with a wide in the Pegasus 33 As far as the Lunar Epic I could not even get my foot all the way in My heel would not go in Who is the fit model for adult shoes a little boyI will return these and then it is back to my never ending search for a shoe brand that works with my feet If I was a fit model for Nikes I think the shoes would fit properly and they would fit a lot more people correctly I have tried Terra Kiger 3 shoes and other Nikes Name a Nike running shoe and I will tell you what needs to be fixed on it

My favorite running shoe to date I am on my feet all day at work so a comfortable cushioned running shoe is a must for me The heel does not feel as locked in as the lunarepic lows but once you go for your first run that feeling quickly goes away as the shoe has no slippage at all Nike nailed this one for me extremely happy

This shoe is the most comfortable running shoe i ever had

These shoes are absolutely the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn they are a little tight up by the ankle though i find that to be a good thing helps give that really locked in fit These shoes do pick up rocks though so i recommend taking them off before walking inside

This shoe looks great seems to be comfortable around the heels The only problem is the toe box is to tight I could not even try them out for a day Everything about the shoe seemed right except the toe box needs to be wider I think the bottom of the shoe is fantastic wish they put that technology on other pairs as well

Versatile shoe that gets the job done for any cross functional training They are much more durable than their competitors and include a better fit with the new bootie like setup

I have been running in these for almost a month now Let me start by saying I run exclusively in the Lunarlon series and more exclusively with the Lunar 13and now LunarEpic 2The cushion feels softer than that of the Lunar 1 or 3I previously ran in and the flyknit on this shoe seems to be softer than it is predecessors which adds to the comfort The sock integration into the upper is nice and removes the concern for tongue slippage The drawbacks for me are the feeling of slippage in the heal which I am not getting more used to At first it felt like my foot was going to come straight out of the shoe on my runs but this never occurred I have also toggled with thin and thick running socks to optimize the shoe Thick sock makes the heal feel like it will have slippage where as a thinner sock feels more locked into the heal Drawback to the thin sock approach is the toe box feels huge My foot is a mid wide for reference The only other drawback is the design of the tread which is a rock magnet I grab a noticeable stone on every run This is rather annoying and bothers me much more than the heal concern That being said I would still buy an additional pair of these due to my love of the flyknit material tongue integration and over all comfort of the shoe It is also extremely light I like the added cushion feel of these over the predecessors however it does feel less responsive than previous models so could hinder some racing times if you plan to run in these I hope Nike does something to improve the tread on the next model If the tread did not have the rock issue I would probably move these to a 5 regardless of my perceived heal issue

Trendy and light as air Super comfortable shoes I love walking running and going to the gym in these They do run small though I recommend going a half size larger than what you normally wear

This shoe is a great add on to my shoe collection Very comfortable to run in They are a little on the heavy side My old Free 4 0 Flyknit are lighter and keep me quick on my feet I have more than 8 pairs from Nike This is one of my favorite this year

Disappointments are a drag These are phenomenal and beautiful but shoes are not meant to be tight A lot of Nikeare great I love and wear tons of them but these days many Nike shoes are too tight Many people believe shoes are supposed to fit tight but no shoes even basketball tennis etc are meant to be tight They can easily be made in such a way to provide total support and performance without being cut too small especially in the toe box

I really love these shoes This is the second pair I have had and am amazed at how feather light they are along with the surprising amount of support They do not feel overly deadened yet provide excellent cushion These have become my favorite shoes and my go to for racing

I have never had problems with flyknit but these shoes are kind wired I purchased a pair of size 10 as usual and they are freaking tight I could not put my feet in even without socks Just returned them and ordered a pair of size 10 5 hope that works

A year ago I bought the first release Had to return it because the toe box was too snug and tight I even went half a size to compensate Anything higher up in size affected my heel to slide within the sneakers

Feels like someone put an extra insole inside the show your heel feels out of place They should keep to traditional designed shoes instead of this

Light comfortable feels like you are wearing a sock At first they may feel a bit snug around heel but as soon as you wear around the room they will break in and fit like a glove so I would stay TTS Definitely recommend I almost feel bad working out in these so nice I do not wanna get them dirty

Simply the most comfortable shoes evah put on my feet The shoe literally wraps your feet securely I have absolutely no heel slip and my heel is very secure I cannot speak of durability as they have just been released but they appear very well made and I expect to run in them for a long period of time

I recently purchased a pair of the NIKE LUNAREPIC LOW FLYKNIT 2 and am truly disappointed Whenever I take a step I feel like my foot is about to pop out of the heel of the shoes The shoe is very tight around the ankles and loose around the rest of the foot I would definitely recommend considering a different shoe

I ran the Huntington Beach Half Marathon in this shoe and it was pretty comfortable for not breaking them in It can run a little tight but will loosen up after a few runs I usually wear the Flyknit racer but wanted to try a shoe that was more durable comfortable and this was a great pick

Currently I am running in the Lunarepic Flyknit 1 Personally for the past 4 years Ive enjoyed running in the Flyknits from racers to Lunars So I have the confidence to say that I have established a great bond between what Flyknit feels best for what mileage Typically Ill use the Lunarepics for distances between 5 and 26 miles Reason being is that they have the strong arch support to withstand the long distance of a marathon but also with a soft comfortable stride at the same time What I noticed new about the Lunarepic Flyknit 2 was the durability Ive taken them on a rigorous test Up hill down hill with incredible stopping power and without the radiating energy against my feet and ankles which is a plus They seemed loose at the first half mile since the opening of the shoe is wider than the first Lunarepic Flyknit with an attached tongue Though after the first mile or so the strides became comfortable I was able to cut corners harder at a faster pace without my feet twisting in place another plus I would have to say its similar to a Flyknit Racer weight wise with the support for a 5 15 mile run Picking up more speed than the Lunarepic Flyknit 1 due to the lessened weight I almost forgot I had them on Similar to minimal shoe I would say though if you want to time your races this might not be the ideal shoe since it doesnt have the responce as the Lunarepic Flyknit 1 It is lighter in weight But as a Monday Friday training shoe Id run in these all day May keep a more supportive shoe like the Lunarepic Flyknit 1 for my long run to keep a more accurate timed race I havent tested them out for 20 miles yet but Im sure Ill use them for my next marathon Personally I try to enjoy the run rather time one so they are perfect for me All in all It doesnt take me long to find out if Im going to keep them or not love at first run Id recommend these to everyone Perry Wells Boston runner

Very comfortable and light The no tongue sock style helps with getting it on and lacing up easy More comfortable than the Lunaerepic 1s really weightless plus the flyknit style makes them look fresh I loved everything about the 1s now the 2s have taken it to the next level of comfortness Thanks Nike

More secure than previous version helps with turns and cornering Feels like youre not wearing a shoe at times More snug through midfoot yet very open and breathable in the forefoot The integrated tongue also makes it easier to get the shoe on and off and less likely to create blisters I need a stability or structured shoe and previously relied on lunarGlides and Structure shoes from Nike These offer the same stability in a more comfortable and lightweight feel Ran a marathon in the Lunarepic Flyknit Low 1 and love the improvements and upgrades in this shoe Will be switching to Lunarepic from here on out

Definitely an upgrade from the first generation Great feel much tighter around the foot which I like Fantastic running shoe

Very comfortable and a nice upgrade from version 1 Will be getting more of these very soon

The Lunarepic Low Flyknit 2 is a very good running shoe for various distances I generally purchase 2 3 Flyknit pairs a year for race training marathon 1 2 marathon I like the new integration of the sock like fit The weight is outstanding not clunky just kind of cuts through the air

The Shoe with out the tongue feels amazing and it eliminates the worry of me fixing my shoes during my runs The souls of the show are tough and give the foot a gliding sensation when transitioning from heel to toe cant wait to get another pair

Have logged roughly 10 miles in these and I can confidently that Im impressed These shoes just make you want to keep running The sock like upper is amazing and holds your foot like a glove Lunarepics are now my go to for my everyday and long runs Fast enough to race 5Ks and 10ks as well

I love these shoes I have ran in Nike Pegasus for years and tried the LunarEpic1 and was not a fan but these are awesome Ive ran a 4 and a 6 mile run with these and the sock like fit hugs your foot and its supportive yet has lots of cushion Fit is true to size I would recommend these

I think I have found my new favorite running sneaker Nike took the lunarepic high and the lunarepic low and combined them in such a way that the lunarepic low 2 was born If you love the original low top version like I do then the 2nd iteration will not let you down The one piece uppersock like look keeps the shoe snug on your foot with no feeling of potentially slipping out just like the high top version with the cuff At first they feel somewhat tight but there is a small acclimation period no more than a day after which you will barely notice them on your feet

Very comfortable to run in effortless run and very well cushioned

For over 35 years I have been a runner and have always ran in Nike running shoes and wearing a pair of LunarEpic Flyknit 2 to put on the miles has been another hit for The Nike brand Very comfortable excellent support very lightweight I cant wait to own another pair in a different color they are that good

Very comfortable and very stylish and good work out shoes too pretty much good for any thing

I am a huge fan of Jordans so when I saw this all white pair I knew I had to cop it Ordered this shoe last month and had it delivered to a friendhouse since I am overseas and he was kind enough to bring it over here to me Everything went smooth had no problems with shipping whatsoever and I was very pleased with it However when I got my hands on the shoe they are not what I expected They look beautiful yes but they are far better looking in the pictures Additionally the quality of the leather is not as good as the past Air Jordans that I purchased The toe part of the shoes had creased the first time I wore them and has continued to worsen over time Tried to give it a quick fix and purchased some sneakershields but no dice the shoe still continued to crease Also the silver jumpman detail on the insole went missing after the first wear so that is very disappointing on my part Furthermore these shoes hurt my feet really bad Caused blisters above the heel of my left foot that I am still waiting to heal before I can wear shoes again thanks Nike Overall this is a beautiful shoe but just uncomfortable and not worth its price

These were purchased for my daughter She said they hurt her feet

Shoes have a nice retro look with shorts or pants They are comfortable but a little pricy

This is a comfortable shoe I like that style of it

they are a good fit and perfect but hard to put on

These shoes are perfect in every way A must purchase

These are great shoes but I liked the smooth leather tops of the10 style better than the black suede tops to these

This shoe is very comfortable and durable I love the fit and style would definitely recommend for anyone whoa air jordan 1lover Very satisfied with my purchase

These in particular look great not to flashy or glossy but still are distinctively Jordan

Smooth shoe to wear with smooth outfit shoe is tight and narrow go up 1 size otherwise stay smooth

I bought these shoes for work because they are all black and it is part of my uniform these shoes are comfortable and durable I have already had to crawl on floors walk up and down stairs and they still look new Jordan low 1s are a must

Shoe is not flat black like picture shows has a gloss tip Other then that bet comfortable and what I was looking for

Comfy durable what you expect out of the Jordan Brand

I wear this shoe to work and to the bars It looks casual yet sharp I highly recommend this product

these are good for going from the office to a night on the town

very comfortable just creases a lot love the kind of laces

I love these shoes but there uncomfortable to wear if you got big feet do not buy these shoes because i bought these shoes and i only wore them twice because they hurt my feet so bad

I bought these shoes for our 17 year old son He said they were a little tight at first but they were fitting well by the end of the day

I love these shoes My mom bought them for me as a gift a couple weeks ago and I have gotten Many compliments Very good looking Very comfortable All around great product

I use the shoe for Fashion and style great fit And every comfortable

Great shoes not your run of the mill retro easy to find only problem is that they crease as soon as you put them on but hey thats Jfor ya

Whenever I buy shoes I buy regular size or wide shoes are too big so my foot is not that large However at the joints my feet are of the wider type since I am a bigger guy and this shoe rubs the skin out of my pinky and big toe

Retro Jordanthat are yellow blue on the campus of you of am GO BLUEAnd the Kicks look great TOO

Always get asked where would you get those from sneakerheads to those not in the shoe game They are comfortable and not your same see them everywhere retros

These shoes are great for any Jordan or shoe collector The color style and comfert are amazing And with the sale price everyone should own a pair

Probably one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn since I am always on my feet I typically like it more than the Adidas Ultraboosts since I do not feel as much fatigue throughout the day

Love the 270 So comfortable I have four pair and will probably get more Treat your feet people

Great fit and comfortable to wear every day Slippery solesif tile floors are wet look out The pictures in the ad look like they are darker in color than they are They are more of a light grey and the stripes are not black like the pictures either Overall happy with them

Great shoe very comfortable Great for waking and exercising I highly recommend these

I spotted and tried these on in store cause of the price and color Like a lot of adidas shoes they tend to run big in my opinion so I went with a size 10 instead of 10 5 after trying both on They make a good walking shoe to work in which was my intention of getting them I work a 10 hrs a day with standing job and I need to keep my feet relaxed and comfortable as possible for when I do my running after work and on my off days in my actual running shoes

do not like product very poor sole and tread

I liked my purchase so much I originally purchased it for my boyfriend that I ended up buying a second pair for myself that is how great they were

One of the most comfortable shoes that I have ever bought

Inexpensive and comfortable Took me 3 trys to finally get them but glad there here

Comfortable and great quality Love this brand and recommend to everyone

I had been looking for the perfect running shoe for years and now have finally found it

I like it that is due to being lightweight and very comfortable while running

Very comfortable nice looking shoes and cheap price

In my profession I have to stand up sometimes for 13 hours a day and these shoes feel good The color the fit and especially the support The shoes looks good too The material is soft and moves when I move Thank you

These shoes fit a little bit big on me but overall I like them I would buy them again if given the option

Fits me perfect length wise and width wise But it in terms of height it lacks depth It feels tight around the tongue area I feel like it I had purchased this one instore than I would have gone half a size up to compensate

They look and feel awesome on my feet I want to buy more adidas has great deals

Bought for work at gym great comfort and breathability Holds up to all the running around I have to do

I have wide flat feet and have stayed away from tennis athletic shoes for nearly 10 years but then I found these shoes to be a complete game changer After a decade of wearing nothing but skate shoes I am thoroughly enjoying the comfort these Duramoare delivering

The hard plastic in the show was digging into the top of my foot

Contrible snickers like so much will buy it again

I love the color and how well they fit They are also not bulky

The shoes look to big despite it fitted me I purchased size 10 5 and the shoes size appearance look 12

Great price for great quality Would buy again at this price

Great price and the look of the shoe is pretty good

I found the Duramo 9s to fit really well as well as being very comfortable I would recommend these shoes to a friend

These are shoes for the price They could have a thicker sole for my preference

This is a very comfortable pair of running shoes with good cushioning The style is cool too

Very happy with the shoe Lived up to my expectations

I Love Adidas Product Because they are Affordable and comfortable

Quality is really poor Really uncomfortable not suitable for sports hiking or just a walk my feet And legs really hurts after using them Horribles Sorry about that I love adidas and I think your shoes are amazing but not this one

Very comfortable worth the buy stylish triple black can not go wrong

Great shoes for working out and can match any outfit

Great Price Great Shoe A lot more than I expected

Very comfortable light weight Mesh is great for circulation Would buy again

These are honestly so comfortable They fit well and are easily to wear around the whole day A nice breathable material that feels good throughout the day rather than get uncomfortable

The comfort and quality of the shoes are great I have always loved wearing Adidas shoes because of the cloud foam soles

Sleek and stylish Great buy for the money

Shoe is comfortable and light Bought for basketball refereeing and it is a great choice

For the price of the product I have no complaints it is comfortable just that size 10 is too narrow

Very comfortable but already coming apart after 2 weeks

The shoes are fine and would probably be comfortable but for the opening were the laces start it is much to tight to be comfortable and the tongue is not wide enough to cover my foot from the plastic piece the laces loop through

They are so comfortable and they look great thanls

Very comfortable and durable great purchase What more can I say

Nice affordable shoe that I can walk hours in and not irritate my knees one of which has been totally replaced These shoes make me feel like I am walking on air

These shoes are comfortable the material is durable and they look great in all black The only bad thing is they run a little big maybe a 1 2 size if that

It is a comfortable shoe for working and or running

Perfect shoes for being on your feet all day I purchased these for my retail job as a salesfloor associate where i am constantly on the move They are super comfy and fit like a glove

I would buy this product again if my son asked me to

Shoe is a touch narrow but not a deal breaker Breaking in nicely Adidas are the best shoes hands down Cant beat this price

I like the order because I am a coach and we signed a contract with adidas so that is all I wear now

When I look for a shoe I have to be comfortable and this shoe at its price is a good shoe to just have as anaround the house shoe or a shoe that is good for all of the daily activities

Lived upto expectations

Fits perfect and comfortable and perfect color

Good looking and comforable shoe but the tread on the outsole is very thin It started wearing out after just one week of running on roads and pavements Also it barely offers any traction in wet conditions

pricing different online vs app overall good but for the price

Color is awesome looks so classic and stylish

I like them because they are perfect to walk and jog

Very nice and confortable style with an affordable price

best shoes my boyfriend loves them he wears them almost everyday

The shoes are very comfortable in general I am not a big fan of the design on the pull tab but it is ok

Great shoe with great comfort I would recommend this shoe for anyone who wants needs a good cushioned shoe

Met expectation Good style Good quality Look forward to using

This seems to be a well made durable shoe runs a little large

The only thing i did not like was how low the heel felt on my foot

Super comfy shoes I am always on my feet at work so it helps

I like the material that was made but do not like they run 1 size smaller than my actual size

I enjoyed the product it is a good show but had to buy a bigger size shoe because my size was not available

Okay shoe and the price was great along with delivery

Looks cheap and dimensions are huge very wide wish I could return them for another selection

Good shoe to run around the track Bought for sons track practice

Very comfortable Looks great enjoyed the presentation Thank you

Great quality shoe for a great price Highly recommend for an everyday shoe

Shoes feel great got them for doing some outdoors activities like hiking etc But I find myself wearing them all the time the cloud foam is amazing A lot of people say the shoe is too wide which it runs a little wide but there are another set of lace holes that are for people with a little less width in their foot 100 worth the buy

Awesome price for an awesome shoe The price comfort looks=WIN Thanks Adidas

I brought for my husband and he said they were very light on his feet

Very comfortable for work Great for the price Loved the style

I hate the way they look but their so comfortable

Comfortable and durable shoe and great shoe for the workplace as well

These shoes are high quality for the price They are also very comfortable

Super comfortable I wanted to buy an additional pair but they were sold out

I stand all day it fits the bill Good product and I recommend this sneaker

Great price comfort and look The delivery was earlier than expected

I like the products very good on my feet looks good I like good outfits

They are not comfortable at the top rubs on my instep hard plastic for shoe laces are not flexible and hurts my feet

it is really nice i would recommend it to my friend

I like the color and comfort nice all around shoe

The quality is good and the materials are comfortable

Great quality for the price Would be nice if adidas had non slip version of these or something similar to these in nonslip

Bought these for work and they make my feet hurt worse than any shoe I have ever had

Super comfy shoe for the price I am able to wear a smaller shoe to get the width I need

It is comfortable fits well light for walk running

Its comfortable and stylish at the same time which is something not all shoes have

Would highly recommend to a friend and make more purchases from this site

The shoe has held up to my very physically demanding job and kept its comfort throughout

perfect for my job when I am standing on a hard floor

Provide absolutely no heel Achilles support when a lot of flex is exerted

Great quality shoes Very comfortable They are constructed well My son loves them

So comfy and effortless to walk around in And they match everything

My son loves these he has a wide foot and he said they are very comfortable

Bought for my son Versatile sneaker with a clean design

I like the comfort and style and reasonable price

Not a good shoe you could do better not HAPPY WITH WHAT I GOT

Rigid plastic strip for laces is apparently causing me a lot of foot discomfort

Satisfied with the Sporty look My choice for the Black on Black

Great fit have a wider foot and this shoe does not constrain my toes

Very comfortable Quality is great would buy again

Nice cushion and fit for the price point Recommended

If you do a lot of walking moving running this shoe is not for you it is not even comfortable just for a throw on shoe to get up and go The price is why I purchased it but it is not a comfortable shoe at all

Found Duramo 9 to be a very comfortable shoe and am quite pleased with itso far

Size is perfect and really lightweight

My friend really liked the comfort and size Good shoe for people with wide feet They run a little large so order accordingly If you are on the 1 2 size order that instead of going up

I like looking so nice and very comfortable sooo good

This is the 2nd pair of Duramo 9 I got I am looking for more in my size I am a stickler for comfort I do alot of walking and always look for an amazingly comfortable shoe Well these are it They are so soft on the inside and there is more than enough padding to ensure you are comfortable The width is perfect as I have a slightly wider foot and I am not uncomfortable

shoes inner sole is not properly placed its looks good but not finished well

Affordable purchase great product Nice and comfortable shoes

This shoe seems quite durable and provides decent protection for the price

Solid shoe great materials super comfortable The best part is the shoes breathe very well ventilation wise

Because are so light and I am not got tired when I walk for hours

The shoes themselves were very comfortable but there was these plastic pieces on the side that every time I turned my foot they rubbed it raw I returned them but I still have huge sores on the side of my ankles

It a gift and the person really appreciate it He loves it

Very comfortable Durable Just a little too wide but not annoying A great shoe for the price I paid

I fell in love with these the minute I slipped them on and they run wide which is great Pretty light too However I found that mine runs about a half size too big this is also my first pair of Adidas and not used to how the sizing is I am right between a 10 1 2 and 11 and went with the 11 and they felt like a 11 1 2 or 12

Best brand most comfortable you will not fine a better value for your money

The shoes are very comfortable there right fit and great all around

Material felt pretty cheap Kinda plasticky Also was very uncomfortable

They are the best and the most important thing is the quality I sincerely love

Adidas makes the best shoes and these are super comfortable love the all black

Looks Good Very Comfortable Great Price for what i purchased

Great price Comfy and great looking I usually purchase wide does but these feel great

I like the product because it is comforable and it is an excellent price

Got these for my boyfriend He works on his feet and is always looking for a good pair of all black shoes that he can stand in for long period of times without cr and Ing up He just told me that we should of bought 2 pairs He is really happy with these shoes

Very light and comfy The cloud foam does the trick with these In a word these are CLEAN These have adjustable shoelace slots for adjusting the width so narrow and wider feet alike can wear these

I am able to comfortably fit my orthodics in these shoes This is difficult with most athletic shoes

I really like the shoes for working out or walking and they are really affordable good job adidas keep it up

Comfortable and roomy I like that there wide I would buy again

Great shoe going to buy a second pair for me and for my spouse

The shoes are comfortable to use while working out

I love my current Adidas shoe and was trying to replace it After fishing through each picture on the website I thought I had it Another reviewer had said they run wide But it was not the same shoe and did not run wide They were very uncomfortable I am returning it and will now go elsewhere to find a new pair of shoes

Great purchase They worked out perfect for my son

It look great on my feet and I like it It very comfortable

Really great shoe for everyday walking and use Very comfortable and provides good cushion

Cant beat the price as well

Good fit comfortable shoe Hoping they will stand the test of time

These are great looking sneakers the only problem is that they are narrow The souls are nice and spongy like you are walking on on a cloud

Comfort level is off the charts The material used for shoe lace may cause some irritation for users with a wider midsole

Purchased for work because I am always on my feet moving They are my second pair of CloudFoam adidas A adidas

Probably the most confortable shoe I own Looks great but the quality seems a little on the low side like it may not last that long but I hope it does I would recommend this shoe

All sizes are whole Poor no halves And a little wide

I use it to go to the gym but its very good everyday shoes also

it is a good fit it looks good Just all around good shoe No complaints

I am female I bought mens shoes because some of the womens shoes toe box is too narrow and my foot is slender so I can not buy a wide width I have flat feet and these were so comfortable

Thx

The Duramo 9 offers comfortable athletic fashion a good value The breathability is great if your not in the rain or puddles

I love Adidas products This new purchase is a great and comfortable shoe

Service was fast and the quality of the shoe are great Useing them as workout shoes as of now and they feel outstanding

These shoes look ok and fit nicely However they have a crease in the front part of it This happened after an hour of wearing them The quality of the materials holding the shoe shape is just awful

I would definitely recommend this sneaker to a person who is athletic

For the price they are very mediocre shoes Not the most comfortable but that does not mean they are uncomfortable I just needed all black shoes that I can wear everywhere without worrying about getting them dirty and these fit that bill

I bought them because of the low price did not really think much about these shoes But they are my dailys now I wear these shoes every day to work because they are comfortable They let your feet breathe they have cloudfoam on the bottom and they fit really nice on my feet Very discreet shoe

Clean looking sneaker very comfortable and the price is great

Great comfort Nice look I use it at the gym good for weight training Fits good on my feet

super comfy my son loves his new sneakers size is kind small but overall perfect

Very comfortable stylish and they look good with anything I wear

Amazing shoes and very comfortable to wear as well

The shoes are super comfortable to walk on The only thing that I did not like is that the Plastic part of the shoe where the shoe strings go kinda sticks out and the edge is a bit sharp So sometimes it digs into my skin and scratches me That is the only thing that I do not like about the shoes Other than that they are great to walk on and are super comfy

I have had a few different pairs of adidas shoes I recently purchased these within the last 3 months and the plastic component that holds the laces in place broke already These are great looking shoes and they are great for my jobI am just sad that I will have to purchase a new pair of shoes so quickly Unfortunately I may not choose adidas with my next purchase Shown in the photo I had to stitch them with surgical sutures until I can go purchase a new pair of shoes

I intended to wear these for my running training but they look so good I also wear them with a casual urban look On top of that they are ultra comfortable

They look fresh and nice for quick trips not being to much on your feet Look periods of walking feel uncomfortable

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had I work in a warehouse where I walk around miles a day The sole feels like I am floating on clouds The tongue on the back of the shoe also makes them very easy to put on without any struggle Lastly they look just as amazing as they feel

These shoes are like walking on clouds Very comfortable

I love these sneakers the fit perfect and are ultra light

I would recommend the shoe to anyone looking to feel comfort

Brought these for my daughter she wears a size 12 and I have a hard time finding women shoes in her size that she likes she saw my nephew with a pair on and she just had to have her own they look and feel great on her feet

These shoes are very comfortable and fashionable Great fit

These shoes are very comfortable and pretty clean if you ask me

I purchased these for my husbandbirthday he absolutely loved them Jordan 1are his favorite type of shoe I can not get him to take them off He said I crushed the game with these lol

Gives me great confidence on and off the court Wanted to buy a white pair but they did not have my size in stock

This shoe is clearly one of the most iconic and I just love it would totally recommend

This classic is a perfect mix of the Jordan Game Royal 1s with a perfect pop and accents of red I fell in love with this shoe when I first saw it at the mall and decided to hop online as soon as possible to pick up my size since these were sold out at most stores in Salt Lake City The Air Jordan 1 is a shoe that will garner attention anywhere you goI feel great about pulling the trigger on this pickup

The shoes look great but I was not aware that one pair was nubuck and not leather all around The pictures on the website make it difficult for me to tell the difference

I cannot understand those people who hate Jordan 1 mid Its very nice quality shoe with reasonable price

Bought the red black white ones but they honestly look orange Its like a mixture of orange and red and pink and it was not the color I expected In the picture for the red ones it looks red but really it looks pinkish orange I still like the design but it does crease alot

I received the Tuxedo mids I like to call them my Stormtrooper JordanGiving them four stars due to the white leather being a bit stiff Still a nice colorway The fit is like all the other mids I own which is a half size larger than the OG 

Been waiting for a while for the triple blacks to come back out favorite of all time durable comfortable once broken in and goes well with anything bc of the silhouette

Great quality and comfortable Nike never disappoints

I rated this product 5 stars out of 5 because I was that satisfied with the product after I received it a few weeks ago I bought this product through nike com I am a young male customer who was looking for a pair of shoes to wear casually and to work out in

A classic air Jordan look with a different look I have heard they run a bit larger but I am a size 10 got a 10 and they fit perfect I wear them casual with jeans and on the go the gumshoe look is a nice unique look on these shoes white stitching looks very stylish as well

The Air Jordan 1 Mid has great RE2PECT for its stylish color and stitching Ive only worn them once and everyones already asking me where did I get them I had 5 people sign up for the Nike app becuase of the shoe I just met these people There comfortable and stylish You cant go wrong with the Jordan brand

Good quality Very creative combining 2 legends together

Super comfortable goes with almost anything and cleans fairly easy

i love all jordan shoes they are very good shoesvery durable

This is one of favorite pairs in the short amount of time if having them I normally get a few compliments on them every time i wear them These shoes turn heads Aside from the complimentsthe overall quality of this shoe is a re2pectful nod to the Yankees legacy Nice stitching and the material is very clean and pristine As with most Jordan 1sthey are comfortable and are true to your size They are easy to clean and do not get dirty quick like other Js You wont be disappointed get this unique version of J1

I just wanted to say as of everything you order online its going to come fresh from the nike factory it might be tight that just means they need to be adjusted once they are on my feet they are very comfortable I cant complain about the price either Im very happy with my purchase

I have returned mid cut AJ 1before because of the fit but this pair fits great and the material is better than the other midI assume this is because they are a special pair Nike got it right on these

The leather is really nice and soft feels a little rubberized Love the gum sole makes for a really durable outer sole Great subtle yankee details throughout the shoe Fits true to size Definitely happy with the pick up

Great looking shoe to add to my collection Maybe going to get another pair

Very impressed with the leather and attention to detail the gum sole add a special touch One of the nicest Air Jordan 1 special editions

Great shoes only down side is leather could have used better quality

Excellent quality and very comfortable Instant classic and great way to pay Re2pect to one of the GOATs Derek Jeter

Very nicely designed and comfortable shoe from the color combinations to quality of materials along with unique logos on shoe

Bought only to collect because of the Re2pect Jeter Jordan trio but I can see myself wearing them during the winter the look way better in person then online

The fit is pretty narrow so that creates a somewhat large extra tied area but its not a big deal The shoes are pretty comfortable if you are not walking a long distance Very stylish and the durability is solid It began to get scratches on the leather just after a few weeks and the upper cloth material began to rip a little Overall it serves its purpose

As a nostalgic consumer I can never go wrong with a pair of Jordan 1 tennis shoes Simple yet great shoe

Super good product and with good durability

I love this shoe fits nice It feels like Im not wearing shoes

My favorite shoe ever Classic style Durable and easier to clean and keep looking Good Compared to other shoes or even other 

These are a great retro look they feel great and go with almost all outfits

I bought for my son and he loves them he says they are comfortable and classic

Overall great shoe extremely comfortable stylish I would buy another pair and fits true to size

Love the way these shoes look even though I have only worn these shoes once they are very comfortable I do say they run a little big so if you are considering to buy a pair i would go a half size smaller if you are a 10 5 get a 10 Overall a great shoe

Shoes looked and felt cheap do not seem like the were a durable shoe

Looks great feels great and has great traction Even though its an everyday shoes I swear it has better traction than the SuperFly 4 You can tell by the way it squeaks so often

My husband wore these for a weekend of lots of walking in Vegas He loved the style and fit but killed his toe next to the pinkie He would def buy another pair but he is not gonna wear them if he has to walk a lot

I love the 1so much that I have decided to grab my 3rd pair this past week Love the classic look They go with almost any outfit you wear Very comfortable and durable Runs true to size Great sneaker overall

i bought these a couple months ago and now the midsole is starting to seperate from the shoe otherwise everything else is excellent

I love these Must have in all shoe collections They have creased in about 5 wears

Shoe speaks for itself they are sweet

I am huge fan of white Jordanand coming in the Air Jordan 1 silhouette as well as the wolf grey accents this is a must have sneaker

Love the all white Great for casual wear as well as athletic purposes

These kicks are overall dope If you do not mind having to get rid of the creases on the toebox with a wet towel and iron every so often get these shoes the all white looks crispy with almost any outfit just keep them clean

Great looking shoe Especially on foot Very durable also

These shoes are a must have I bought them after Christmas and they feel great I got them in all black they match with anything Im thinking about getting another pair of these Air Jordan 1s are a must cop

can not go wrong with mid 1Hold up better than AF1s too so I always keep fresh white on whites handy

Bought this product for my son for Christmas He absolutely loves it They look great fit good and are awesome for playing basketball in

Enjoy the white retro style offered in a well known well made shoe

I love this all white mid jordan 1 very comfortable and just clean for all occasions

It has good support for his arch and he likes the fit

Look so cool with me And it is cheaper than my country

Great shoes I was skeptical on ordering on line because my feet are really narrow but I did pull the trigger I was happy with the service and shoes I really like the free shipping and return service Also I do not need to travel to the mall because the Jordans I ordered are not available at the malls I looked at I would definitely recommend it to any hardcore air Jordan or Nike Air Force one fan like me

My boyfriend loves these sneakers I bought them in both black and white

Lowest price out there and my boyfriend absolutely loved them

I bought these to custom These shoes are a great canvas They are comfortable for walking Not really basketball

Goes well with anything and everything so its a must have

I love it so much Thinking I should buy more kind of this shoes

This is a great shoe and looks awesome on your foot

I ordered a custom pair of these a few months ago and im glad i did They are comfortable breathe well and are good to ball in with good ankle support If you have a wider foot i suggest getting your size and getting them streched

I love to buy Nike products especially like this it is super comfortable and I have nothing to say

The fit is true and the feel great I prefer Jordan 1 

Its a very nice all black shoe its not like other all black shoes It will match with mostly everything and has a nice fit to my feet I recommend you buy it

The shoes is nearly perfect I like it its cool and ecommend this to someone

The AJ1 never gets old All black works with everything a day this shoe works great for evening sneaker

Jordan 1 no doubt to mention about how it is unique and special for everyone you need to get this soon Please looking forward to having Jordan 1 metalic which releases soon

I love Jordans especially 1s nike com makes getting them easier great job guys

My husband loves his sneakers and this was the shoe he wanted He was happy to get them and loves them The shoes look good with a lot of things He said that they are super comfy My Nike experience is beyond pleasant as always

These shoes will never look dirty unless you step in mudd Easy to clean and look nice

A must have pair of Jordanfor any sneakers fan Very well made and classic versatile look They are very comfortable and will be a staple in my shoe collection I highly recommend these shoes

The product i ordered fit exceptional well and are very comfortable I love the color and they way they feel as i wear them I would definitely recommend these to anyone Nike always seems to please me and always have what i want

highly recommended keep buying from nike com

What you see is what you get Nice quality all black shoe no hype

exactly what was expected came out of box perfectly white

I like the material very durable also fits great Should have more colors available

I bought these for my son whose feet are a bit wide and he loves them

Perfect fit for playing basketball and lasts as long as you can play

100 satisfaction Excellent quality Would highly recommend

got these all whites as a blank canvas for a custom paint job Lining was dirty on one of the shoes as if the boxer had filthy hands Maybe it was a display pair somewhereCleaned up OK but would have hoped for a little better at least out the box

Awesome pair of shoes can wear with just about anything Thanks You

This pair of sneakers is everything you would expect from Nike and team Jordan Comfortable durable with a perfect fit

Loved them from the minute I opened the box Favorite pair of everyday shoes

Shoes are comfortable I always wear them outside looks good on jeans and shorts Overall good product

One of the best buy i had in many years can not wait for the next time

The shoe is made extremely well madeand fits perfect

They look exactly like the picture I think im gonna buy a stock pile A perfect blacked out sneaker None of the stitching was hanging off the shoe Flawless

This colorway looks incredible The textures the style totally awesome Very happy with this purchase

I like the shoe I might end up picking up another in a different color way

I have only had the shoe for a short time now but it is very comfortable and looks great I do not use them to run they are so nice but if you wanted to I could see them being fine especially when playing basketball Great shoe and I highly recommend

I purchased this product for my son who is an avid fan of Nike Air Jordan series He loves the pair he got he is saving for the next pair

A clean classic shoe a real must have for any sneakerhead or jordan collector

I love the color schemes and the ankle support The only thing is that I would like there to be more colors

I wear a size 11 Like most Jordanthis is a narrow shoe Takes a few wears to break them in Slight discomfort in the toe area until it is broken in for me All in all a good purchase

I have these and have owned them since february I really put these shoes to the test and they have performed fantasticly They stay clean and break in very quick I would say one of the best retros i have had in terms of quality They still havent creased and ive had them for almost a year Would recomend to anyone who is on the fence about these

These are my first pair of Jordans I can now see the hype Super comfy and they look great The only reason I didnt give it a 4 star review is because of the toe creasing that starting as soon as I wore them

These are my first pair of Jordan 1and they do not disappoint The colorways are dope and the comfort is excellent I wear mine in the city all day and no issues yet

I bought these a couple weeks ago in need of some chunky white hi tops I have narrow feet and these fit me properly in my size but were too narrow for the first 2 weeks I broke them in now and they fit perfectly I like the look a ton and have been wearing them all the time They squeak all the time and are hard to do footwork in when dancing But that is to be expected since they are basketball shoes I would buy another pair any day though

This product was originally bought because of the name knowing that Nike is a reputable product Very comfortable just wished it was not such an expensive shoe I bought the shoes for my son who is only 16 and has many years to grow and I had to buy at Nike com because of the size 14 the stores do not carry a shoe in that size which can be an inconvenience

Very comfortable and stylish Wear these with any clothing and they look good

i wear them for casual events concerts casinos out door events there comfortable they fit well with casual clothing sports clothing there good for whatever you have planed for the day i would advise these to anyone for what ever event they plan for there day

The Air Jordan 1 mid is one of my favorite shoes to wear It has a original style that is timeless with a elegant design and it is very comfortable to wear all day I am very pleased with my purchase and with the product overall I would recommend this shoe to any and everybody young or old

To start off these shoes are very comfortable and for those who do not know most retro Jordanare usually very comfortable Another thing is that their is some texture on these shoes that you may not see in the picture which adds a nice touch In this particular pair of jordans they run a little narrow its ok but if not tolerable a half size bigger will due To end my review I will just say these shoes will brighten up a room so be sure to stay clear of mud for obvious reasons but if you do happen to incounter some mud or dirt these are pretty easy to clean with soap and water Well I hope my review helped and if you do decide to buy these you will not be disappointed

This brand of shoe is the best thing i ever bought They are super comfortable durable long lasting great for sports and overall very sleek They look and feel amazing They are very awesome shoes I am getting my new ones for school this year I chose black blue

Great comfortable sneaker Highly recommend Classic and not flashy

GODLY SHOE ALTHOUGH I WEAR A SIZE 9 THIS 9 WAS SMALL SO I WILL BE ORDERING A 9 5 I RECOMMEND THIS SHOE

These are a all time classic and work well with many outfits I highly recommend them

These shoes are comfortable and clean I wear them casually and they are all white so you can wear them with anything Very good quality does not crease in the toe box as much as air force 1 

Great shoes even better looks You can not go wrong with these bad boys

These shoes lasted me 1 and 1 2 years it was amazing but when you have them for that long they start to smell really bad

Nice color way and materials There comfortable for a AJ 1

Nice Shoe Stylish Fits true to size No creasing

Great looking shoe Runs narrow I do have wide feet but these were very narrow I returned for a half size up and broke them in and they get the job done Would definitely reccoment I got the black and red combo

I bought a pair of the black gym red anthracite pairs of jordan 1and I was very excited when I first go them but a few days after wearing them I came to realize one of the tongues was put on crooked so it tends to shift the the left side of the shoe which I can deal with Creasing is also a big problem with these shoes I thought because the toebox on my shoes was made of nubuck rather than leather it would not crease a fast I was wrong There is a huge crease on the right shoes after just walking around the school hallways for 2 days All in all I give them 1 7 10

The shoe is narrow other then that it fits perfectly

5 STARS

Jordan I is self explanatory no need to hype it up you already know Great Color Way Good Price Love the shoe

Very nice shoes style fits with almost anything

Has a nice fresh classic clean look Very comfy

Nice and pretty the swoosh is in different material Looks nice and shiny

Classic Jordan high top very comfortable and super happy with the quality as always

Really comfortable shoes Crease easy My first pair of JordanLove them

nice kicks might grab another pair of all whites

Classic old school Great shoe that is a must have to add to your collection

JORDAN AIR JORDAN

If you like the regular air forces this is for you

Have over 10 pair of Jordan 1s This colorway is definitely one of my favorites

Very comfortable Classic old school style Classic Chicago color way with the black and red Love them

i love the shoe especially if you like the og retro stile with the white shoe box and middle area and dark toe this shoe is dope

These are my first pair of Air Jordan 1 I have worn They are perfect for any of my outfits Also gives lots of support in the ankles and very comfortable to be in 100 recommend to anyone who like or loves sneakers

Can not go wrong with this purchase

These are nice for the spring and summer the color pops

This shoe is very comfortable but you would be better off going 5 up than your normal size probably

I really like these shoes but they run too narrow which makes them hard to brake in

shoes are great and priced well the only problem is the toebox creases easy but they are shoes so that will happen they do run a half size big

shoes easily crease just like some air force 1s I usually wear a 10 5 the size is true and the pair i got is slightly narrow with the left shoe it might be an imperfection in the shoe but overall the quality is good I will say again I might of walked 32 steps and they creased already I knew it was going to happen the shoe is all leather and the box is different from the regular Jordan boxes

Bought the white black and the platinum tint color ways Overall the shoe is one of my favorites in recent memory Love it for the gym light weight very comfortable and the white black look dope I wish the the blue ones were actually white and blue cuz they would be incredible looking Took a gamble cuz the picture makes it hard to see the exact tint but honestly it is a weird hue that makes it look like a dirty white sneaker that you tried to clean Passed on them and returned Will probably buy additional colors though cuz the shoe is a goflossycarter

This version seems to resolve these issues with the upper the flyknit is comfortable and expandable I size up 1 size and breathable These shoes have a plastic clip on inner heel which provides minimal stability Decent arch support as well The react foam is bouncy responsive and soft

I have purchased several pairs of anime over the past couple of years all the exact same size I got these and they are a half size too small Back they go

The arch in the support and the sole itself just doesnt feel comfortable Plus the sole started coming apart from the shoe after a few months of wear summertime wear 80F average high

Comfy sleek lightweight These are fly as Showtime with a high fashion modern twist

Great shoe Lightweight and very comfortable Easy to pair to keep track or your runs or walks via the app

Very happy with this shoe Had the Sonics before and have enjoyed the increase in cushioning on the sole

Coming back from a nasty injury I had to look for a very comfortable shoe with high stability This shoe really lives up to my expectations Provides the shock absorption I need Feels lightweight and certainly looks great

Have wore the shoes for about a month No issues or complaints Do about 20miles a week jogging

Good comfort and Great Style and color The better shoes for me

This is a very comfortable shoe with great tracking app Only have 135 miles on them so far and tread is going out already which seems low but otherwise can not complain

I bought the HOVR as a replacement for an older pair of HOVR that I recently retired I have run over 200 miles in these shoes which is an accomplishment for me and I absolutely love them These shoes are light well vented at the top front and are comfortable to wear I have worn running shoes by another company that cost twice as much as the HOVR but did not have as much cushion that the HOVR does I also like the stretchy shoe laces that do not get untied in the middle of the run Finally I like the fact the HOVR syncs with the Mapmyrun app which I absolutely love using

I bought these to wear in the operating room and I could not be happier These are light and the cushioning is super comfortable

Fit is true to size No need to break in as the shoe feels comfy out of the box The bluetooth tracker works as advertised Though I wish the app would provide more statistics

These shoes fit well and are comfortable I like the Bluetooth connectivity which allows me to track workouts

These shoes are the most cushioned supportive running shoe I have used from UA and I have owned a bunch of them The fit comfort and performance are all excellent However the record technology is poor which is why I did not give these shoes 5 stars The data and stats from the shoes on my runs are wildly inaccurate I have calibrated the shoes multiple times to try and fix this yet the data I continue to getin particular distance and paceare way off from realty I do not know what the issue is This is the first time I have used the record technology in the shoe with Map My Run despite having that feature on many shoes And it is not worth the money to pay for IMO because the data is not accurate

I have own several athletic shoes and the HOVR have an awesome fit feel and comfort level

Avid athlete and love running These shoes are great for mid distance as well as in the weight room Usually do not like UA shoes but these are awesome

I wore these shoes when I went to Disneyland Walked all day on them and you can feel the comfort from the HOVR foam I was ready to go another day with them on Great fitting shoe and all day comfort Walked about 10 miles on them

Verygood shoes sizing good comfort excellent very happy with them

These are my go to running shoes Very comfortable Paired with Map My Run they track my runs and give me all the info I need

This is the most Amazing running shoe ever Especially the Bluetooth technology imbedded

The shoe is great But I am not keen about the colour as its not congruent with what is shown on the website They are far toooo bright If you want a rainbow of colour and great performance then these are for you Otherwise get something more subdued

I love these shoes The Bluetooth connectivity to the Map My Run app is awesome the shoes fit amazing Super comfortable to run in I switched to these shoes from another brand and I wish I had ordered 2 pair I highly recommend these to anyone serious about getting the most out of their runs My average mile time improved by 7 when i switched to the HOVR Infinite

With a the running I do I very rarely spend this much on shoes but these are worth it They may run a little small but for running you kind of want a tight shoe to prevent blisters It took a couple of workouts to break them in but now they feel great Highly recommend

This is a great sneaker for everyday performance at the gym track or grocery shopping it is super comfy a little heavy but amazing nonetheless Going to buy a second pair when other color options come out

I love that these shoes give me a accurate step count Sync with my Apple Watch The technology rocks I plan on buying a 2nd pair

Lot of money trying to fix my feet orthotics did not even work I purchased a pair of UA for work and all my feet issues have gone away just amazing I have bought 2 more pair since I love them they are my shoes from now on

Hover is my new go to Just bought the hover golf shoe and it is just as great

The sneakers were made well and the concept of tracking your activites was great The sneakers were much too narrow and tight A wider sneaker was not available

Shoe was very comfortable on long runs fits very well would recommend this shoe

the best of the best To run and very comfortable for everyone who likes to run to whom they have good shoes

Great shoes Very comfortable for my longer runs 3 4 miles and they look very nice

Another great connected running shoe This shoe fits perfect and is very comfortable It looks big and heavy but it is not Highly recommend this as a trainer shoe

This shoe is extremely light and very durable The upper is very well ventilated and the lower has not worn nearly as much as other sport shoes that I have spent much more to buy Great value for the money great performance in the Florida heat especially on court track surfaces I will purchase another pair

The part of the shoe around the ankle is higher and harder than most other shoes so it rubs against my ankle In addition the cushion in the shoe is on the harder side It is beautiful but not the most comfortable

I tried a pair of Hovr sonic for the first time They were the most comfortable runners I ever had until I tried the Hovr infinite shoes I do long distance and after coming off injuries the Hovr infinite provided me with the support and cushioning to allow me to get back in form

by far the most comfortable tennis shoes that I ever had

Is great very comfortable these are very great shoes to run in

Gave as a gift to a seasoned Runner who thoroughly enjoys them

it is Ok Looks good online but I did not like it in person did not like the look of the toe or the oversized wide heel I prefer the Speedform Gemini 2 Shoe

Bought these shoes in my normal size 8 5 Was a 1 2 size too small so I sent it back I did not try these shoes on the treadmill or outside but I did try them on inside my house They are very comfortable and I think they would do fine with my style of running I have right knee pain and I often run 10 20 miles per week depending on if I am training for a run I am a slow runner who does 2 5 hr half marathons without issues

Respect that it won an award for best running shoe and respect that its got great ratingsit just did not work for me I got blisters after first mile I run 3 miles x3 wk The Sonic and Sonic 2 and the phantoms were much better for running for me The Hovr line is great just not this shoe for me

Overall great running shoe Sizing runs 1 2 size small compared to most other brands The shoe is extremely comfortable lightweight and responsive My average runs are 4 5 miles 2 3 times per week with a once weekly 8 10 miler Lightweight and breathable socks are recommended as the toe box gets warm quickly

I do a lot of trail hiking and these shoes are the most comfortable I have found over the years Additionally I feel much better after my hikes having worn these shoes vs other trail running or walking shoes Also the shoes look sharp

Supper happy with these shoes for my treadmill running workout Been using them for about 2 months now purely for running

Have not come across a better shoe than this one I have 6 pairs of shoes right now and this is the only one I use at the gym and that is because it feels like I am running in air not ground So amazing One of those just got try experience it for yourself instances

Love the technology Especially handy on the treadmill with very accurate data Perhaps the Guardian or Sonic 2 are better choices

I am a pretty avid runner and my favorite shoes have always been anything from UA After my last pair of shoes tore I decided I wanted to go all out for my next pair and bought these I love the design style and having Bluetooth is a great feature especially since it can still be utilized when running on a treadmill However these have to be one of the least comfortable pair of running shoes I have ever owned There does not seem to be any support in the soles and as a distance runner it is difficult to do anything over 3 miles I have put roughly 30 miles on these so maybe they just still are not broken inI am going to continue running in them simply because of how much I spent but I would suggest any other UA running shoe over these

Ok so I reviewed and researched I wasnt sure about purchasing running shoes for daily wear as they are intended for running but I beg to differ You can absolutely wear these walking as well I see how walking shoes get reviewed as a must for walking but in my opinion these are just as good if not better They were comfortable out of the box I cant say that about other brands UA has never let me down thus far I have owned basketball and running shoes ordered off the internet and straight out the box Fitment seems perfect I do not know how they do it but they are impressive I am not getting paid for this comment but I thought credit was due to this company Thank you UA Lifetime customer here

Definitely UAfirst more traditional high quality neutral trainer I would say this is the 2nd shoe they have made like this Bandit 1 being the first it is a little heavy underfoot but comfortable and protective and has a smooth transition from footstrike to toe off I would not be surprised if people are busting out marathon distance in this shoe

I have worn them about 10 times now for my workouts cardio and lifting as well as some treadmill work since I live in NE and its be 45 degrees below average but the shoe has performed great My feet do not seem tired like before in other shoes Support and comfort delivers on the promise Sizing was perfect for me and I am a size 8 5

I just started running and I went out and bought some other brand shoes and was not comfortable in them saw the ad for these so I bought them and they are so much more comfortable My run has gotten better because of these shoes well worth the money I paid and the next week went and bought my wife a pair

I could not be anymore happier with these shoes They fit perfectly are very comfortable and real easy to connect to the MapMyFitness app

Overall the best hovr I have worn Broke in right out of the box with the most cushioning in the footbed and sole of any I have purchased to date

Had these delivered on Friday and used them for the first time today Probably the most comfortable shoe out of the box I have ever had Used these for a running cross training workout today They are very light and have great support They were very comfortable all throughout my workout with a variety of exercises These are definitely a new favorite

Most striking is that the midsole and outsole on this HOVR are the best I have ever used I guess technology and competition have created shoes that are really kind of extraordinary

it is a great running shoe performance wise with cushion and response However it took three orders to finally get the size right I usually wear 9 5 as are my other UA shoes but ended up with an 8 5 in the Infinite

Great running shoes I only have good words for them They are extremely comfortable hold my feet perfectly they cushioning is marvelous And for my personal opinion the look really nice That was a great job UA

I can say that Infinite are one of my favourite running shoes I could not believe how great is the cushioning Loved the design Excelent job Under Armour

Proeasy to pair to the app exceptional comfort considering the features and full sole they are light

I was very happy with the looks design of the shoes but after wearing it to gym i felt discomfort on treadmill and elliptical Eventually i had to returned the shoes

Super impressed by this shoe More comfortable than a Hoka One One which is made for comfort for folks over 200 lbs Plus the wireless integration of the shoe with the free Map My Run app combined with the coaching tips on cadence and stride length to boot and the HOVR technology had me floating on a pocket of air Strong work UA

These shoes are strikingly gorgeous But they fail when it comes to comfort

The shoe runs a half size to small First UA shoe I got not true to size

These shoes are amazing Super comfortable and great performance Definitely love them

As a big fan of the original Hover Sonic I was quick to buy the Hover Sonic 2 this season and I was not disappointed

The HOVR sonic were recommended to me by a friend Fit is great and true to size I have a wider foot and these still feel great I needed more comfort for longer runs as I usually wear a more minimalist shoe for training and these did exactly that Bluetooth feature is helpful The shoes are light despite more cushioning Product itself looks to be made well no weird tabs of rubber or foam extra pieces of thread sticking out or coming undone Great looks for casual wear too

I have been a loyal UA customer for their running shoes since the Original Gemini My Gemini series went away and I was disappointed but I have been holding to all my 5 pair of Gemini for the longest Tons of miles on them and finally I have to retire them This is when I come across the Sonic 2 Great shoe very comfortable with a lot of cushion and light weights The drop is 8mm so be aware of that The top of the shoes is very comfortable unlike other brands that have a lot cushion but that particular feature they lack have not test them on a long run yet but so far so good in 10K Highly recommend this shoe

These shoes were awesome right out of the box Easily one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes that I have ever owned and very fairly priced The fit is spot on and the shoes take a lot of shock away from the feet and knees when you run If that were not enough the HOVR connect technology is mind blowing It actually connects your smartphone and your shoes using Bluetooth This allows the shoes to analyze your run and send reports and tips on how to maximize your efficiency straight to your phone it is amazing technology I just received my shipment for my 2nd pair of them These shoes are so comfortable that I just ran a 3 1 mile race with a brand new pair straight out of the box with no breaking in period I highly recommend these shoes I will be ordering another pair soon

These shoes are amazing and really take running to another level I am happy to have them

The HOVR line is my new go to for shoes can not beat the fit performance and price on these

I got the red ones Super comfortable and light weight Got plenty of compliments on how nice they look I wear a size 10 shoe and after reading some of the reviews stating the run small so I got a 10 1 2 and they fit like my other size 10 shoes

Great daily runner I have own quite a few UA shoes over the years and this is my favorite

Most comfortable shoes I have ever had Like running on a cloud I love them and the phantom se will be a customer for life Thanks a lot

The new UA HOVR sonic 2 is even better then the first series Sizing is right on comfort is top notch a really great shoe for running My only complaint is lateral stability I find that any movements side to side the shoe turns over but if running is your game these shoes will fit the bill

I have always loved under armour shoes These do not disappoint Comfort all day long

I started purchasing UA gear a couple of years back I never really had a go to brand as I would shop around for shoes that were the right combination of comfort practicality cost and so on UA is now my go to brand for everything including running shoes

I am in love with this shoes the size the comfort the lightweight feel of these shoes are just amazing I am definitely gonna be getting a second pair

I purchased this shoe being a little skeptical Very glad I bought them very comfortable when running breathes easy and I love the Bluetooth feature I bought another pair of the HOVR running shoes last week because I love this shoe

The design was nice Very comfy shoes it just runs small It gives extra bounce when running

When I first saw the shoe I was a little skeptical because of the way the material felt but once I tried the shoe on it felt amazing It has a great fit Fits extremely snug to your foot As far as performance I use it to walk and I have no complaints

This is the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn

I bought these for myself and love the support of them

So glad I bought a pair these shoes are very comfortable

Excellent running shoe The InfiniteI actually returned of blisters This shoe is the best for running

I bought the all white pair because of how they looked These are a great looking pair of shoes They felt so comfortable just doing daily activities in them I thought i would buy a pair to exercise in So I purchased a grey pair as well It was not too smart of an idea because i can not bring myself to wear them during my evening walks jogs I am not an avid runner so i can not proclaim to be too well versed in the different brands of running shoes I know for a fact that these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I am impressed I may get a pair of Hovr Phantoms for my evening jogs At the least that will be my excuse to buy more of these Hovr shoes

This shoe was great when I owned i I really like the material in the heel felt like a sponge and was very comfortable Unfortunately I returned these shoes as they are not wide enough for me Beware guys this shoe is the not the widest I tried to do 2 workouts in them and I was not comfortable If it comes in a wide version will definitely purchase

I have always purchased another brand of running shoes This is the first time I purchased Under Armour and find that the overall comfort and performance outweighs the other brand This product is a great value as well

could not be any happier with this shoe I have been buying UA gear since they first had their products out I will never change and this shoe is insanely comfortable and fits like a glove Slightly heavier than most of the running shoes I have bought from them but you cannot beat the cushion it gives you I will be buying more of them

Great training shoes for the value They fit perfectly they are comfortable and my feet stay cool

I have only had them a week but I am happy with the shoes so far

I bought this sneaker because it looked great It is the type of sneaker that you wear in the gym and or just hanging out around town They are super comfortable as well and the price could not be beat

they look good they feel good the size was on point which is very hard when buying on line they are so comfortable I am 250 pounds I am on my feet all day

I love these sneakers They are comfortable and easy to clean

These Puma sneakers are highly underrated They are extra comfortable I could walk in these all day They are also great for exercising The price was excellent AND I had a coupon for 20 off I tried to buy 2 pairs but they only had 1 pair left in my size

This is my 5th pair of Pumas in recent months They are by far the best shoe for the dollar you can buy I love them and try to keep at least one new pair on the shelf at all times Will continue to buy

This is my 3rd pair of this series of Pumas Bottoms are wide enough to use as training shoes Great for left  or right quick movements and best price on line

I was surprised how comfortable this shoe was Very stylish and fits true to size Nothing but compliments from people

I have never gone wrong with this pair of Nikes I am flat footed and need all the support help I can get This shoe hands down is the best running shoe I have ever purchased under the Nike brand

This pair is the best pair of running shoes I have purchased to date They are incredibly comfortable and I find myself wearing them on a daily basis because of how they feel My feet do not get fatigued or sore by the end of the day like they usually would with my other athletic shoes I bought them initially for running and workouts and now I use them a lot more than what I had intended to use them for Plus I get a lot of compliments which is an added bonus Overall great shoe

Looks really good and got a lot of compliments but the back sole tore in 2 months Had to use shoe glue to fix it So not I only wear them for aesthetic purposes

A very good tennis for long training presents a good response and grip

These shoe are the closest thing to the ultraboost Finally nike makes a cushion to compete with adidas The cushion is a combination of zoom and react it is more responsive than boost And it is very lightweight My only gripe is the upper is like a plastic mesh it is not very giving and it is breathable

The cushioning is soft for when you want to run a little slower but at the same time responsive so you can really punch it when you want to pick up the pace Pleasantly surprised to see such a dynamic performance

Coming back to buy them

Have had shoes for a couple months of fairly light use and they are already falling apartment and almost unusable The soul sticks out further than the heal of the shoe does and the foam is already tearing apart as my foot must strike too far back

I really wanted to like these shoes at first but they are the worst quality shoes I have ever had which makes me sad to say since considering I love all my other Nike shoes The first pair I bought I had for 3 months and the sole separated so I tried to give it another try since I thought I was just unlucky Then 3 week later and under 50 miles my second pair of Pegasus 35 turbos stared to separate again it is mid track season and I have to run in ripped shoes since their warranty claim takes 3 weeks until I can get a new pair I wish Nike could compensate since it it my second pair and I am mid season

I did buy online for my husband as a gift he just loved it the first week it had a small how can I explain like it was peelingwell I did chat to Nike and immediately they did everything to send me new shoes I returned the first ones The new ones are perfect after a while I love Nike and sometimes of course the product can have problem nothing is perfect after a chat to Nike they just fixed the problem and I got new ones It was very simple

If you are on the fence about buying just give it a shot

Not recommended for cold and or wet weather Great for everything else

These shoes look great but are not worth the premium price or turbo designation The soles started to crack a month and a half into wearing these shoes I was barely starting to break them in when a small crack started in the foam soles until eventually a small piece of the sole started to come off These are not worth the price and they do not hold up very well

I was not sure I would find a Nike shoe more comfortable than an Air270 I love my 270s but I did The Pegasus Turbo was it Very comfortable and snug I could wear these all day They were great whether on a long walk or a run After wearing them 6 times 1 run 5 walks I found a separation in the sole of the shoe at the heel The split was horizontal right in the center of the sole as if two pieces the upper and lower soles were separating Such a disappointment I hope Nike makes this again with a much more durable sole These are 5 star shoes with a 1 star durable sole Keep the glue handy

The shoes are doing really good and it would be a 5 star but for some reason a breaking it appearing on top of the back heel help

One of my absolute favorite shoes released last year and imo up there for shoe of the year The cushioning on these is outstanding even 325 miles in I am approaching the end for my current pair and I am desperately trying to get as many as I can to keep the ride going I really hope the 36 has a Turbo but if not I am perfectly fine running in these for a very long time Classics

Shoe is light and comfy but for the price tag you would expect these to hold up better After only my third run in these the heel began coming apart on the right shoe Looks like it is happening to a lot of people too

For years I looked at Nike Pegasus and for whatever reason took a pass Now I need to have my head examined No brand or model of runners have ever enabled me to tick off miles so effortlessly as this shoe right here As I said to my wife after my first time using them I felt like I was running downhill in theseWorth noting I was on a treadmill with incline at 1 0 I have since taken them to outdoor hardpack flat trail and the results are just as good No joke this runner is super legit and puts the Turbo in my running

I use the Zoom Pegasus Turbo mainly for training it is is generally more durable than the Vaporfly 4 Flyknit which I prefer for racing The performance and feel of the Zoom Pegasus Turbo is similar enough to the Vaporfly 4 Flyknit to be great for training If it was not for the Vaporfly 4 I would race with the Zoom Pegasus Turbo also

I would definitely recommend the shoe to any runnner who wants to get faster and wants joyful runs Best shoes I have ever had The shoes are comfortable while also being light The strides moving of feet while running become easier as you can train hard and can pick up to high velocity Work hard and the shoes will give you results The design of the shoe is amazing also

Literally had these for 2 weeks and they fell apart My runs were not very long and after about 10 of them the sole fell off I had a pair of regular 35s before them and they were perfect DO NOT BUY

Really great running shoe that I have been looking for However the sole does crease really fast sadly Other than that I would definitely buy another pair to run in after I wear this one down

Purchased the shoes just before the holidays in mid December In less than a month the tail tip of the sole has begun to separate While the shoes are extremely comfortable the construction quality is quite lacking

Way better than the zoom fly not as good as the 4 but very comfortable and runs true to size I would give it five stars but the mid sole arch feels a bit off and there is a disconnect between the step off and the heel that is a bit disconcerting like two separate shoes sewn together Still great just not perfect

Greatest shoe I have had in a while The first time I put them on was like walking on air Only downfall was that the soul on right shoe started to to come apart from the top I wonted have mind if I had them for a while but it happened the first day wearing them

I used it for a half a marathon and it was great I love how fast and responsive this shoes I used it for my fasted 10k and I recommend it if you got budget

I love how comfortable this shoes is I have had my pair for a week and a half and I have already put 14 miles on them I was not the biggest runner but now I run 4 times a week and my feet never hurt These shoes have driven me to run faster and farther and now I have decided to run my first half marathon Bottom line these shoes are magical

Being in the Army I go through a lot of running shoes as a part of training and these Pegasus Turbos are the best I have worn in my career They fit true to size have great room and support exactly where your want it and are really responsive on the road during your run I wore these on my latest PT test and ran one of the fastest times on my 2 mile that I have in a long time For me they are definitely worth the price as I enjoy my runs a lot more since picking them up

It is just made to feel comfortable Very nice for walking and runnig I recomend it strongly

I have been getting ready for an upcoming marathon and have been piling on the miles Typically over 50 per week The shoes I had been using were leaving my legs pretty fatigued and injuries were starting to creep up I decided to try the Peg Turbo for comfort and I was not disappointed They are also a fairly fast shoe and remained comfortable at faster paces could not be happier

I run frequently and I have achieved many PR using the Pegasus turbos they are extremely comfortable and they give you that extra edge at the end of long runs when you need it the most I have read about many issues regarding the durability but after a couple hundred miles they have held up quite nicely These are definitely the best Pegasus model to date

It was conftable light and looked really good Currently I am injured and I bought these Pegasus Turbo shoes about a month ago I have worn the about 3 or 4 times and only ran about three miles total in these shoes I was sitting outside after a quick little jog and I look down at my shoes and noticed what I thought was a piece of grass but it was not It turns out there was a rip in the rear sole your shoes Would anyone know how do I fix a rip in the shoesThis is a nice shoe but has absolutely terrible durability

it is been less than a month and the sole from the rear has started peeling coming off Poorly done Nike Such shoddy manufacturing for an expensive shoe

I got this shoe on release day and it has seen limited wear since This weekend I just noticed that the heal had already split and will likely crack off with not much more use The shoe is super comfortable and one of the best runners I have had but can not recommend it

These Nike kicks are like wings for my feet I fly to my destinations they are so airy and lightweight Feels good to belifted

I have worn these shoes for the last three months and I have been very pleased with their weight performance etc Their price is a little higher than what I was used to with regular Pegasus shoes but they are so much more comfortable especially during runs of 8 miles I highly recommend They have been my daily running shoes for three months and have held up to 250 miles pretty well

If you read and watch a lot of shoe reviews across the web you will probably notice that this shoe tends to be quite polarizing People either love it or think it is a disappointment Well you can mark me in the former c and The key is going in with reasonable expectationsjust because this shoe has zoom does not mean it is going to be comparable to the Vaporfly 4 But that is ok it is great for easy and moderate pace runs regardless of distance And it is a pleasure to wear on recovery runs I also periodically end up using them during tempo and progressive runs and they were more than serviceable though not my favorite I do however find them too soft for my liking on tracks Also I know some people dislike the upper because the stripe irritates their toe but this is perhaps my favorite upper on a Nike running shoe ever Again this shoe is not for everyone but I am a big fan Durability wise I think both the zoom and react foam hold up quite well in the shoe

But i was shocked last week when after a 10 miles run i found that the sole is pretty damaged with only 60 miles of use Pretty shocking for a 180 shoes

i would buy more if they were cheaper they are amazing

What a great shoe I had switched my Pegasus to Adidas Bostons but now I am back and totally love this shoe The first 2 3 runs the shoe was super stiff but once broken in they have been amazing for short and long distances I highly recommend this shoe i love the type of response and feel and comfort running in them and I have had no pain

I got these on August 26 and I noticed yesterday Oct 18 that the heel foam split I use these for indoor running a few days a week on a treadmill and other various forms of cardio and weight training I never take them outside and they live in my gym bag I could not have been more careful with these shoes considering the price I am very disappointed in this shoe

Greatest road running shoe I have ever experienced I run 3 4 miles a day and up to 6 miles a day on the weekend The energy return and ride comfort have me waking every morning looking forward to when I can get a run in These shoes have me taking the scenic route home pushing me forward with each stride A true joy to run in

My 15 year old son picked these shoes because they were so comfortable Bought in August and by mid October the soles were splitting apart in the front and the back For this much money I would have expected the shoes to hold together longer

Just a few weeks into the wear of these shoes the heel foam split These shoes are very comfortable however they need more work especially on the durability aspect

This shoe is an absolute home run I ran maybe 10 steps and I could not believe the difference They feel so right on my feet that I actually felt more confident while running in them I have tried lots of different shoes over the past several years some that I have liked and a few that I have not liked but I have never had the experience I had today with any other shoe I know they cost more than many other shoes out there but believe me they are worth it I have no hesitation in recommending these shoes to any runner One word of caution I typically wear a 10 5 The store did not have a 10 5 so I tried an 11 and wound up buying an 11 5 a full size up from my usual size

I have just gotten into Nike shoes this year and have to say these are absolutely incredible Light yet soft and bouncy all in the same shoe I used these to train for the Berlin Marathon earlier this year and my runs kept feeling better and better in them After 15 miles I seemed to have an extra gear I normally did not have not sure if the shoe was making my effort easier or what They felt so good I ended up using them in the marathon and set a PR with a negative split on the back half of the marathon My feet and body have never felt better after a full marathon Great work with this shoe

A great running shoe but be warned the blue and white is more of a blue and gray

Most comfortable shoe I have ever put on they run very small though so order 1 size bigger

Trainers arrived with a hole in the upper really poor quality from Nike

I have worn a lot of Nike runners trainers in my life and this is far and away the most comfortable pair I have ever put on my feet

The shoe is a great running shoe However the durability is not great After not even a month of wearing the shoes the ZoomX and react layers have started to separate at the heel

The Pegasus Turbo flexes in the middle of the shoe instead of at the forefoot I had cuboid syndrome after my first 10km run in the shoe

I was a little worried at how little room there was in the toe box but after a couple of wears i am glad I went true to size Had to size up in the Epic react but went true in this shoe One of the comfiest cushioning set ups I have ever worn and the sneaker is extremely light I prefer to use this shoe for lifestyle wear but it performs well too Looks great too Lots of compliments

I am a female 47 years old runner and these shoes are the best running shoes I have had in a long time they are very comfortable soft and and lightweight They are perfect for my flat feet I usually struggle finding the perfect shoe but these were absolutely amazing I can not wait to buy them in every color

First time trying the Pegasus series very impressed Overall a neutral feeling shoe I am a neutral pronator and mid foot striker and I felt like the shoe supported me The zoomx foam definitely felt very unique not as bouncy as ultraboost but felt dense yet slightly springy and still allowing a good feel of the ground not overly cushioned I already train in flyknit free for short runs and Epic React for longer runs but the Pegasus Turbo provides a really nice run

These seem to be the perfect in between zoom fly and vaporfly 4 I hope Nike brings out a future version with the carbon fiber plate as its missing that push you get while running in zoom flyThe shoe seems to feel good but at times the upper would start to warm up Waiting on Nike to restock vaporfly 4 but

I love these shoes especially for long runs and tempos but the uppers are way too thick and hot I hope they develop a more minimal version of this shoe in the future A flyknit or zoomfly sp upper with the turbo sole would be amazing

Toebox of the outer mesh is slightly wider and the upper is more breathable

If Nike can make a running sneaker that is more comfortable all around I would really be impressed but that is really a tall task THESE SNEAKERS ARE AMAZING The energy that you receive back from the sneakers is just fantastic The epic react is comfortable as well but a different type of comfort Please hurry and product more colors I am a fan

These are one of the best running shoes out there They extremely light very comfortable and have aerodynamic look Would definitely consider these for both distance and timed runs

These Pegs are so amazing for any runner aiming to feel as comfortable as possible on longer runs tempos and even daily training miles Since I have gotten them Ive put almost 100 miles of road a little track work and some gravel trails I have no complaints other than the fact that the upper feels a bit bulkier than the peg 35but Everything else in the shoe is perfect

I would consider the first run or 2 in these shoes to be throwaways I found the ZoomX foam only to take a little getting used to my foot really seemed to settle into the sole on landings Once you get used to it they are pretty good shoes The toebox has lots of room in it they didnt get uncomfortable over a 14 mile run I think these shoes are good trainers You could easily run a race in them and be fine but if you have ever run in the Vaporflys these are going to be a little letdown unless you consider that their purpose is for training not racing Durability is up in the air at the moment The rubber nubs on the sole are already showing some wear despite the shoes only being 2 weeks old The foam may survive but Im not sure how much of the sole will be left Time will tell

If you cant get a pair of 4 then try these I had higher expectations

Great design and very good material fabric

Nike was kind enough to provide me with a pair of these before the official release date I would echo some of the other comments here the shoes look large but feel light I have done a few short runs5k and three medium distance runs 5 8 miles and the shoes have performed very well I do not feel like I am running with any bulk around my feet In addition to feeling great the shoes have a very strong look to them as well I wish the racing stripe down the middle had a customizable color but that is a minor complaint Great shoe

May be the best running shoes I have ever worn Was in love from the first stride Feels like I am 20 years youngerthere may be a few rounds left in these old legs just yet Hard part will be not wearing them on every single run Will complete long runs of Chicago marathon training in these and for race day it will be a hard choice between the Turbos and Zoom Flys

So this looks to be a new favorite in the collection

My favorite style shoes and they are so comfortable Not my first pair however my older huaraches had the pull tab to help put them on and these do not that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 it is a little bit of a hassle to put on

The shoes run maybe a half size small but I expected that with huaraches so I always buy a half size larger the width is medium all depends on how you lace your sneakers as well they look awesome and clean Great for casual wear of when your out to the gym

This is the perfect shoe both fashion forward and comfy and the price you can not beat No Matter what time of the year or what the dress code is this shoe gives you great versatility A classic old school brand with a new age twist

I will also echo that they are really hard to get on once they are on the upper is very comfortable shame about the soles being so hard and stabby in the middle of my foot

These shoes are absolutely the most comfortable walk run shoe I own I did not have to break them in at all I did have to order a half size up to get a more comfortable fit

I bought these online for my brother with special needs He LOVES red Nike shoes and I get him a new pair every year for xmas It is so hard to tell from the picture but the opening is super small They do not unlace to loosen so you can put your foot into them the tongue is completely attached to the rest of the shoe Someone with great dexterity may have no issues putting these on but not someone who is challenged a bit with dexterity Exchanged these for him for a more user friendly pair

I tried so many shoes to find the most comfortable shoes It is this shoe This is really comfortable to wear all day Good design and functionality It is one of the best Nike shoes of my life Highly recommended

These shoes are very comfortable to wear and very good to run

I own a pair of these and they are amazing I would just like to know what material the laces are on this shoe so I can order a new pair since my dog chewed through them

I work as a delivery driver and I have problems with sciatica so my needs for shoes are very specific These shoes have fit every single one of them if not exceeded them I actually come home from work with no pain I also feel my back getting better each day if that makes sense Four years of stocking for a busy large gas station left me wrecked But these shoes are helping a lot I can imagine for people who are well bodied these would help a lot as well I say if you are thinking of buying them buy them But buy them in person rather than online to see if they really are for you and to get an idea of the constitution of the shoe

I am normally an 11 in womenso I ordered a 9 5 in these because they are menshoes I just got them I could barely get my feet in them and my toes were jammed in the end I am annoyed because the reviews at the top of the page say nothing about the shoe running small which means I have to go out of my way to return it before Christmas Overall though I think the shoe looks very good and I love the support the sole gives I am just mad that I have to return it and order another pair

Just ordered these shoes for my son and a little concerned they look more pink than red Do they look red in person to those that have gotten theirs

This shoes is very comfortable and has very good cushion But it runs very narrow and slightly small I normally wear 43 or US 9 5 but this shoes is clearly too narrow for me Buy one size up would be much better

If you are buying these as a running shoe invest in something else However if you are looking for a great pair of shoes to wear around town these are the ones They fit great and have a ton of support

I have a custom pair of these shoes if you are looking to customize these shoes be careful because when you customize them they might not look as good as the picture which is what happened to my huaraches make sure you are really happy with the picture so that you like them when they arrive other than that overall very nice shoe very comfortable and good for running

I love the shoes and would recommend them to anybody

Recently brought this about three weeks ago and the shoe already started to tear The heel sole and the traction is tearing At this point im only wearing ot to work out at my local gym Never again will i buy or recommend this product

I really like this shoe It is very comfortable and feels great White Nike shoes are very difficult to keep clean I treated my sneakers like I was walking like diamond engraved gold and the knit body got a not very nice brown color after 8 days Very comfortable but I think they run Very small order 1 2 to 1 full size bigger than your true size

Fits a little snug around the toes but have had others experience same problem and still love them

Nike Air Huarache

i love the look and feel go great with any of my clothes

I love the color the comfort and the style of the shoe

Runs a little small no arch support which is surprising for a running shoe Soles were a little stiff Overall fit and comfort was Ok Shoes did look nice and made my feet look smaller

They run half to a full size small Very comfortable once you find your size Great looking sneaker

I would highly recommend huaraches They are true to size and amazingly comfortable I will undoubtedly be purchasing another pair in the future

These sneakers are classic and look very sporty They are also very comfortable feels like you are walking on clouds They run small though if you wear a size 11 or 11 5 get a 12 but other then that these sneakers are the best

love ordering shoes on line never had to return or had problems with fit

I had the high tops high school and the lows are nice to the colors are for the summer nights nices

Order and Shipping

Comfortable and stylish one of my favs for everyday use

I love these sneakers it fits perfect and its very comfortable I honestly purchased them to match my youngest son he love them as well Happy customer yes you will be Shipping is excellent and they get everything correct Thank you Nike

5 I would suggest going true to size when most suggest going a 1 2 size up Going true to size will give you overall support from heel to toe This gives you maximum shoe performance Going a half size up will eventually cause your foot to move around in the shoe after wear lowering it is overall performace capabilities

This shoe is amazing and it exceeds expectation As soon as i got it i knew i made the correct choice do not over think it You must habe this shoe in your closet

I definitely would order at least a 1 2 size if not a full size Very light weight and comfortable and the gold coloring is on point

Upgrade on would classic Huarache styling color combo is on point

Once you find your size the shoes turns out to be comfortable It is a very fashionable shoe Feels like you are walking on air

The Nike Huaraches are one of the best overall shoes that I have worn They are sleek and also so comfy that you will forget that you have them on your feet

The comfort that it gives wild running helps to keep my focus and keeps my feet from aching on the journey of my daily run and would recommend these to everyone

Looks good with a Jacksonville Jaguars Jersey Very comfortable

Although I do not do much running the Huarache is a great shoe in the areas of durability and comfort I have worn my pair a couple hundred times and the wear and tear is not too bad Even if you are not intending on using it for running it is a great shoe to own Only complaint I have is the odd sizing I recommend going at least a half size up from your normal size since the Huarache does run small

Have always been a big haurache fan Love how comfortable they are Had to snatch these up especially why they were in sale for such a great price

Opened the box and the shoes look great Put them on at first was a very tight fit and want sure if my foot was going to fit After having them on for an hour they widened and are very comfortable

its perfect you should get them cuz you gonna get all of them chicks

I wear these shoes all the time because they are so comfortable from running to walking I never fell discomfort in these shoesh

I do not know much about shoes but these are overall the one of the best shoe I ever own Fits me perfectly never a discomfort from day one and still looks good after all this time I prefer wearing this over all my other shoes It does not feel wobbly when I walk like most lightweight running shoes yet does not feel binding like boots

This is a great shoe and is now as a shoe collector one of my favorites The air huarache is extremely comfortable and lightweight My only complaint is that there was noticeable marks and excess glue on the shoes I was able to pick off most of the excess glue but there are some marks that wont come off I read another review before buying that had the same issues but there was only one other person with this complaint so I figured it must have only been their pair that happened to have this issue Other than that I love the shoe

I love the way these feel I love the shaped material that keeps them snug on my feet they are so easy to slide on They are so soft and comfortable I hope these never go away These are my favorite shoes and I wear them anytime I think I may be standing or walking or running for a long time I will continue to purchase them I LOVE HURACHES LOL

Nike Air Huarache MenShoe Great Shoe so far

I received my shoes and I could not believe the quality I could see glue all over the shoes I know this is not normal because I only wear nike shoes and this never happened before could not return them because I really want them and they are sold out in my size Nike should never ship inferior products to there customers do not know how these passed quality inspection

This was immediately my favorite pair of shoes These are the sleekest most comfortable shoe nike has ever designed I will be buying many more pairs in the near future

I really like the shoe My only con is that its a little small I wish I had ordered a half size bigger but Ill manage But I really recommend others to get these shoes just order a half size bigger

I have been wearing Huarache brand for years I have always made sure to order half size larger as others have mentioned I regularly wear size 9 and 9 5 does it for me I use them for running 4x week as well as for outside wear I have owned many pairs of Huaraches because they not only look great but feel great as well

These shoes are amazing I could wear them all day long the cushion in the heel is on another level You like bounce when you walk It may look heavy but the shoe is pretty light weight These shoes are perfect light comfortable and have a really sweet old school vibe to them I recommend them to anyone looking to buy these

Very nice summer shoes used them for walking around town I liked them without using socks

Overall this shoe is pretty comfortable I have multiple pairs of huaracheI made sure to order up a size this time since they run a little smaller

Worth every penny The green is not too bright but definitely gets noticed

This shoe runs about a half size small maybe one whole size small But the comfortablilty is great As soon as you put your foot into the shoe it feels like a sock on your foot The shoe seems very durable I would recommend anyone to buy this shoe

I purchased this item recently because i was having alot of foot aches Iam a handy man at a 15 year old complex for 300 apts so just imagine how much back and forth walking I do From the the first day i used this shoe at work i didnt even want to take off to sleep beacuse of how lite they feel I would recommend this to any person in my line of work or who loves the feeling comfort around the whole foot

I love the look of this shoe but more importantly the comfort of this shoe

I am a nurse and often wear these to work my feet feel just as good at the end of the night as they do when I first put them on

Very comfortable light yet durable looks great and feels great

Great looking shoe Tons of colorways Great price HIGHLY RECOMMEND

My son love the color The shoes are comfortable

I had these shoes for about 4 months now I went to put them on and the strap in the heel snapped I wore these shoes a couple of times They are very comfortable but overall the durability is poor I love huaraches but Nike needs to fix the strap issue

The product does not look as put together as shown in the pictures The glue is visible and the finishing looks badly done

So after 25 years this is still and was at its release one of the most technologically advanced running shoes thanks to Tinker Nike ever offered So light but not to light Def not a billboard on your feet Sorry if thats your thing These were designed with a purpose and almost didnt make the cut Thank those who pulled the trigger We are now fortunate enough to have infinite color ways of a timeless sneaker that truly provide something specific to those who need it I collect a couple groups of specific nikes wear for fashion and wear to train These are a must have Put them on your bucketlist Whatever you choose to use them for they fit the bill

comfort is so good i like the og colorways with the mesh nylon toebox go half size up

I bought these shoes for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved them They came at a fast rate and I am simply satisfied with my purchase

The strap broke on my huaraches one month after wearing them but they are still comfortable

if you arent a growing kid buy 1 size bigger like say you wear a 11 buy a 11 5 but if you are a growing kid like me and you want about a thumb size space up top buy 2 sizes bigger like if you where a 11 buy a 12 Very comfortable love them custimize if you do not like the colors and they do not have your size thats what I did xD

A lot of people say this shoe runs small and after trying my true size and a half size larger I prefer my normal sizing It all comes down to preference but the shoe provides a soft snug comfortable fit They are fantastic

It may look darker than I thought but I highly recommend to get this

I loved these shoes for training in the winter back in the 90s The forefoot is better cushioned Zoom Air in the forefoot is new I believe but the toe box feels tight even up 1 2 size Maybe better up 1 full size The heel fit is fine and I like the arch support for my high arches Great for supinators if you do not need a big toe box

Love this shoe very stylish and com4table but runs very narrow you need to order 0 5 size BIGGER Ive the all black version the only thing I do not like about this shoe is all the glue spots I truly hope Nike fix this issue

They run a size smaller because of the sleeve in the inside I have fairly narrow feet and I had to go a 1 2 size up Overall they are a very comfortable and stylish shoe Good for lite running or casual wearing

I would recommend getting a half size bigger but other than that i love them

Very nice shoe Get it a half size bigger than normal and your fit will be perfect

Fits perfect great weight Im very satisfied with my shoes and service

Was very excited about receiving these really like the shoe But the material was pretty stiff from try on and didnt quite fit my foot quite right Yes I understand that the stiffness would go away with wearing them seeing that I only tried them on but as I said they did not fit my foot right Length was fine just had dead space most likely from my foot shape Not taking anything away from the shoe just didnt quite work for me I would still definitely recommend them

These shoes are so amazing They are comfortable and fit nicely once you figure out the correct size for you They run small so anyone looking to buy these shoes should probably go up a size or a size and a half I am naturally an 11 in women when it comes to tennis shoes but they didnt have my size in any store I finally found that size in a different color but it was too small so I went to mens sizes and got a 10 It fits perfectly and I would definitely recommend buying these

My son loves the shoe I am glad we got a 1 2 size too large because they run a bit smaller than most probably because of the band around the achilles tendon which I am hoping will stretch a little as he grows so the shoe fits longer

I ordered these shoes for my 14 year old son He loves them He says it feels like hes walking on a cloud when he wears them The purchase was easy and the shipment was quick I would order from Nike com again

Love the sneakers so comfortable and fit great I have room in them since I have wide feet

Good running shoe you just have to order 1 size larger

I bought these for my son for Christmas he is going to love them Cant wait for more colors to come out to buy more

Very comfortable all most like wearing nothing on your feet

Love this shoe I wear it more for casual wear and its very comfortable and I love the colors it does run about 5 1 sike smaller than usual

I absolutely love this shoe great fit and comfort

I wore the shoe two days after I bought it and it fits perfectly It was very comfortable and durable simultaneously I would recommend the shoes for all kinds of people

I bought these shoes for my son He LOVES them He has been wanting then for awhile now Finally found his size He says they are very comfortable and stylish

When this shoe came out I wanted a pair but I could never get it because of my size or it would be out of stock Size 14 I finally ordered them and when I first wore them they were amazing They are so comfortable and they fit perfectly Im very happy with my purchase Thanks Nike

This shoe is very comfortable and fits really good I like them so much I cant wait to buy the all white ones

Very comfortable fits small Love the shoe Will buy more pairs soon

Very comfortable shoes and great durability I can tell with great care they will last longer than a while Thanks Nike

The shoes are so fresh They look so good I got them for my boyfriend and he loves them

The shoe is very comfortable and durable Its light and whatever material that is used for the insole is very comfortable also

One of the most comfortable and stylish sneakers Love them

Bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them

Great quality I would recommend this product

I love this classic shoe designed by the man himselfH They are the most comfortable shoe that I have bought They do run really small Im a 10 5 usually tried an 11 for these and they were still too small so I went up to 11 5

I really appreciate the fact that they are so light and sock liner comforms to my feet making it easy to stand at work throughout the day

they are comfortable and a nice casual shoe ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

I own a lot of sneakers this by far one of my most comfortable shoes I own Feel so good I would recommend it for sure

The all black color way of this shoe is so chic but its also one of the most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn and thats saying a lot because of the amount of Nike running shoes that I own Definitely order a half size to full size up but seriously the most comfortable shoe ever

Shoes fits almost true to size Wish the white was still available Love the comfiness Would buy again

When I looked at reviews I seen go a half or whole size up So I normally wear a size 7 5 in men In this shoe I went with the 8 5 and they fit perfect So people also stated that the strap on the back of the shoe broke I feel that the reason why the strap across the heel on the back of the shoe broke was because they needed a bigger size For me to be able to fit a size 8 5 perfectly when I normally wear a 7 5 the shoe has to be bought in a bigger size for everyone No matter if its a half or whole size up

2nd Pair of these bad boys and I plan on getting another because of the comfort level of these shoes Great to wear around even better on your feet

Love the show got it today but the quality of my shoe that I got from here is poor The right toe is scuffed luckily it is the triple black so it do not really matter but still cmon now Nike

One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever owned I obviously do not use these to run in but just wearing them on a day to day basis they are awesome I wear a 10 5 and ordered that same size They fit snuggly on my feet but I enjoy that fitted feel could not be more pleased

Great purchase

I love these shoes they are so comfortable and I own several paies

This shoe is amazing to train and looks great

Im not much of an online shopper I decided to try it out for the first time and its so easy I love it Although this specific shoe does run very small I just recommend getting a whole size up I will definitely be doing the online thing more often Thanks Nike

I was well pleased with the shoe This is my second pair that I have purchased this year and plan on purchasing more I also was pleased with the quick shipping It only took a couple of days to arrive

Needed all black sneakers for bartending tried these on and they are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn My feet would always hurt after a shift and they havent since I bought these They run small so get at least a half size bigger than what you normally wear

I purchased the sneaker for comfort and for the look Few weeks down the line the whole bottom on both sneakers just unglued

This has to be the most comfortable shoes I have owned in a long time

great ptoduct very comfy i eould recomend this product to everybody

I have always love the product Now since the low tops came about its great Great fit great flexibilityable to wear with variety

My favorite sneaker Nike makes I bought these for my boyfriend and he hasnt taken them off yet Great color way extremely comfortable and durable Highly recommended

Most comfortable shoes I have and can be worn with anything def an everyday shoe

This sneaker is comfortable and is a nice clean look without doing too much I also love the light weight feel of this sneaker its kleshay but its like walking on air

Shoes are very comfortable and lightweight I have them in black and white Both fit like a glove I suggest going up a size

Cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool shoe

I purchased this shoe for my 17 year old son He has not taken them off since he got them Truly a stylish and comfortable shoe

The All Black Huaraches That I Purchase Are Great Shoes And The Fit Of Them Is Very Tight But Comfortable For When Your On The Go

Super light and comfortable Size runs small for me

Wanted these forever but could never find them in a 15 I praised the lord when they were restocked and havent taken them off since

They are very comfy shoes and they are good for walking around I usually wear them for style and everyday shoes instead of running with them But I do run in them when I need too They are an awesome shoe with cool features and textures

Comfy shoes definitely a happy purchase I recommend

The shoes are very comfortable I used them to work and am never tired with them

I love this shoe not only is it casual its stylish and feels great on foot I will definitely be purchasing another pair

This shoe has extreme comfort and looks great My only issue is that the material on the outside can appear pretty flimsy but after a weeks use I havent noticed any wear to it yet Would definitely recommend this shoe

These shoes are very comfortable but runs small I wear a 15 so I couldnt get a half size bigger I just hope they stretch

very supportive and comfortable runs small best is 1 whole size

great job on the shoes and the color way well done

I really like this shoe because of the comfortability of the shoe it is like wearing a perfect formed fitting glove on your foot and may i add that the shoe is like walking on air they are so light on tour feet So far i have bought over 9 pairs I just love the look and how this shoe makes me feel in the gym especially during my boxing training

One of my favorite shoes ever The triple black looks awesome and also comfortable to walk around in Recommended

These shoes are great You want to get a half to a full size larger since these do run small I normally wear a sz 13 and a size 14 in these fit perfectly

Comfortable shoe Would like to eventually buy a few styles My fiance loves them also

I love the shoes i got they help my feet out alot with all the activities i do

So Far I have Purchased 2 Pair And Have 0 Complaints I Will Most Definitely Recommend This To Anyone Looking For A Comfortable Shoe

This shoe is lightweight and durable it fits like an sock over a sock and yet it is stylish as well I will consider the other products in this line for future purchases

Great buy Sneakers are very comfortable I would recommend these to any one looking to purchase a pair of sneakers

My son loves these shoes very comfortable he says fills like he walking on cotton

The only complaint is that they run small I went a full size up and they fit well on me I like the color way as well

Amazing comfort and looks By far one of my favourite designs from Tinker Hatfield Thank you Nike for releasing this retro I was so excited to pick up a pair especially in the original scream green colorway Unfortunately things became bitter sweet when one of the heel straps snapped after my 3rd wear of casual use I should mention that I followed many peoplerecommendations of sizing up at least 0 5 my usual size it is a real shame because I can not even wear them anymore and they still look brand new I am taking a big interest in the OG Teal Orange colorway that just released but I am concern about another broken strap sigh

So far I have worn it twice and have no complaints super comfortable fit well and are the same as they looked online

Solid shoe but a little plain Would be better with more red Will use as a workout shoe

I really love the the durability of this shoe Would recommend all my co workers to buy them Thanks Nike for a great product

The really like the style and comfort of this shoe All white is great for the summer

I wear these shoes very rarely but when I do it is for comfort and style I do not do any aggressive running or training in these shoes but for some reason my right heel strap broke As I went to put on my shoe it popped off This issue with the heel strap breaking is becoming common with this shoe I do not know what the problem is with materials but it does not last long Given that the shoe is not suited for running training or anything else for that matter It looks nice and all but they run small and are not durable

These shoes provide optimal comfort blended with a very attractive modern design From the first step to when you take them off it is always a comfortable stylish experience

First I purchased because this shoe because it looked great as well as comfortable I was not disappointed other than the color of the midsole was a much lighter gray than the one you see in the photo here

Super comfortable shoe but runs very small True 11 5 in Nikes but needed a 13 in these No regrets as I am getting my 3rd pair Love

The air huarache is a great shoe very stylish and the new colors have made it appealing to the new sneaker enthusiast like myself It is comfortable to have on for hours at a time Light weight and flexible The only issue I had with it was that it fit a little to small length wise I usually wear a size 9 5 but I had to jump to 10 5 to get a comfortable fit Overall a great sneaker to own and I will definitely be adding a few more color ways to my collection

Shoes runs very small be sure to buy a half size bigger

I hover anywhere from size 11 5 to 12 in all shoes I initially tried the 12 in these and they were very snug While a snug fit is intended for this shoe my foot was uncomfortable in the 2 mins I tried them on The elastic band that goes across the back of your heel is set inward so it actually pushes your foot forward into the shoe I do not have wide feet but this definitely made me feel like I did I sized up to a 13 which is a size that I have never bought but everyone I know that has these has said to size up at least 1 size I did not believe any of them until I tried them on Great shoe but size up

This sneaker runs an entire size too small smh be carefull

Great that these have been released on the site for the US I have been receiving mine from the UK for awhile now and I have to say these are my favorite silhouette from Nike apart from a few Jordan brand SBand air max shoes Extremely comfortable as most Nike products are

Got them in all white very aesthetically pleasing shoe I usually run in Huaraches but the 97 offered plenty of support for miles of walking did take a couple walks to wear them in kind of stiff at first Definitely a very stable shoe great for support during gym work outs Love nike from the 90 and super happy to add the 97 to my collection

This shoe looks like a Sketchers knock off Very disappointing nike

I ordered the shoes based on the pictures and when I had seen them on other people but when I opened the box I was surprised because they were actually pretty ugly Like I said I was very surprised because they looked so good in pictures They are also very narrow which is not a bad thing if your feet are the right shape but it is something that people should be aware of

The inside of the right shoe soul is thicker then the left foot Very uncomfortably I ordered the black and orange one had to send back now the blue and white are made the same way SMH BEWARE

I have never really like the styling of the AM 97 but the all black nocturnal colorway is by far the one that did it for me The black takes away from the wavy design look and placed on the white sole gives it a more sleeker look I would say they run big because I wear a 9 but picked up these in 8 5 and they fit great They are not the most comfortable so these are definitely good for casual wear could not be more happier so glad they are released these in April because it took me 21 years to finally cop a pair

I have loved this shoe since my best buddy Austin had them back in 1997 It was futuristic at that point in time and has turned into a 20 year classic it is just as comfy now as it was back then Runs TTS in my opinion and even good if your foot is a little wide like mine Great summer sneaker

I only wear these for casual wear or go lift at the gym They look good with some pants on sweats or shorts I can wear them all day and they feel comfy Comfort is everything for me That being said it took a couple of wears to break in the shoe was tight on my toes

I love the Nike Air max shoes and have been running in these for years But they are too wide for my foot and I hope Nike will make this product available in a 12 for Men

Very comfortable I will recommend to anyone to purchase

Looks good Feels pretty comfortable Size and fit are perfect Idk about durability have not had them long enough to know Kind of a heavy shoe if you care about that sort of thing I do not run in these shoes nor do I recommend it

Well worth the price tag Comfortable styling and all around best shoe Will buy another pair in the near future

very comportable cushioning

I was not a fan of the newly modified UB especially the laser colorway I loved the older models and was not even thinking of giving these a chance but they grew on me I purchased the laser colorway ironically and now I love this shoe I was never a fan of running in my UB because I was stuck on my nike but I must say they really improved the performance aspect of these UB I do suggest staying true to size with this model even though I usually go up half a size with previous UB

I review shoes at this price point very critically I DO NOT overrate However this shoe is perfection Aesthetically the color block contrast look pops looks great The fit is amazing nice wrap support around the arch And the molded achilles heel lined with what feels like memory foam PERFECT As comfortable as BOOST midsole was before this shoe is on another level The redesigned outsole has superb traction grip nice and wide supportive foundation

So far these ultra boost 19 are in my opinion the best shoes Addidas has made Nike airmax can not even come close to these and how comfortable they are Adidas hit a homerun on their boost line I am a Nike guy but have been slowing converting my shoes to the boost line up

I have this shoe and the 720 I think Vapormax is more comfortable because it is more flexible to stretch if you have a wide foot I still like the 720 just not as much

a good look and equal feellike the bubble sole just wished had more colors in stock for larger feet 12

Very stylish and comfortable shoe Everywhere I go I receive compliments

One of the most stylish and comfortable sneakers I have ever purchased You can wear it all day or strictly for exercise You will not be disappointed

These run a bit small so I would personally advise buying a half size up from your normal fit But the air bubbles and cushion support is all world This makes the sneaker very much worth the money My feet feel great in them and there is a nice variety of colorways I bought a second pair and considering a third soon

We own several pairs of VaporMax and love these shoes My Fiance and I work in a Nursing Home Im a Nurse and he is a Maintenance Director so we walk ALOT They are very comfortable and allow us to work all day ache free We have alot of matching His and hers shoes and we got LOTS of compliments on these shoes

I have purchased 3 pair of the Nike Vapormax within the past 4 months being a diabetic it is important for me to wear a comfortable shoe After trying several different name brand shoes I honestly have to say that my Vapormax are by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased I have been able to enjoy long days at amusement parks without suffering any type of foot or leg fatigue I highly recommend this shoe

I purchased these for my husband he has been having aching heels so we tried these He loves them and his heel does not hurt when wearing them Look like I am gonna have to buy another color because he wears them almost every day

Like the comfort and design Feels good on hard surfaces

Great for everyday wear not just running also lightweight and sleek design

Great overall comfortable shoes Awesome styling and great breathability for performance or everyday wear If timid the Vapor Max is not for you It is a bold sharply designed performance shoe

runs a little narrow but true to size I initially ordered the size 12 thinking they would run small I normally wear an 11 5 returned them and got the 11 5 overall very comfortable shoe would recommend

The shoes look amazing but they are not comfortable at all I have narrow feet and they stilll cut into my foot If you are looking for style they are great If you are looking for comfort do not bother I returned them and got the Vapor Max Plus which I never go wrong with

One of the best pair of NikeI have bought Would recommend this shoe to anyone and would buy more this style again

If it does not fit do not force it I stalked these shoes for 31 days I tried them on in the store I walked around in them I wore them to work once people loved them but they hurt my feet so bad that I had to wear open toed shoes for 2 days These are the worse fitting shoes that I have ever purchased I loved them so much that I posted them on all of my social media websites just to retract my statement I am so brokenhearted

I have wanted these for a long time and because of the Nike stance I bought them

I like the original vaporMax fit a little better but these are not bad at all I love the look The colors fly knit I have 3 pair going all white for my fourth

I just ordered my 4th pair I work on hard concrete and these are the only shoes that make me feel like I am walking on cushion all day I tried them on in a store first so I knew toORDER A FULL SIZE LARGERthan my normal size The knit make them comfortable on top which make them better then the average gym shoe I Love the colors that they come in too I buy them ONLY FOR WORK COMFORT though

the look is very nice but the comfort is not there hurt the insole when using to walk or on exercise machine If I could I would send them back today to me being the 3rd pair I have bought from them these really are the worst

Love this pair they are supper bright and really get noticed My 5th pair of VM 2s and it seems the Vapormax are the only kicks I wear anymore Love them

I actually own three pairs of the Vapormax Flyknit Being a critical care registered nurse I am on my feet an average of 15 000 steps a day at work The Nike Flyknit Airmax series are the only shoes I have found that keep my legs feet and back from hurting at the end of a 14 hour shift I do recommend buying a half size up I have had to do this with every pair of Nike shoes I have ever owned so this is not a problem for me Overall this is a great shoe that is built to perform and last

I like air max shoes Have had many of the styles over the years But that cool looking bubble soul is uncomfortable to walk in it is almost as if I can feel all the connection points of the soul on the bottom of my feel while walking The Rosche has are way more comfortable I could not imagine using them for actual sports activities

I also tried on a pair normally women size 10 in men size 8 5 and it was a bit too short Great looking shoe so def will exchange for larger sizes

nice shoe colors are very cool they fit a little tight but still very nice

Shoes were great while they lasted unfortunately the flyknit tongue ripped after just a few uses

This is a great looking shoe But overall not worth it very uncomfortable Sizing was not an issue I know everyone is different but my issue was in the inner side of the shoe kept sticking in arch area of my foot I wish they were comfortable I would I definitely would kept them

My husband bought me a pair from the outlet in Charleston for Christmas I have never had a shoe that has felt as comfortable as this I wish they came in more colors I just went online to buy him a pair of the gray and as I was checking out they sold out They feel like you are walking on a cloud

I never had a pair of shoes that made me feel like I am walking on air but these vapormax shoes definitely feel that way Unbelievably amazing They hug my feet and heels perfectly Very eye catching design as well I like to use these for the gym and also as casual wear

HUGE disappointment and have to return Guess Im still waiting on that new black color way to be released

Nike totally missed the bus on the VaporMax running shoe The Nike VaporMax is the worst Nike running shoe I have ever purchased and that says a lot as I have purchased 1 2 pairs of Nike running shoes for the last 15 20 years The VaporMax is super uncomfortable The shoe leaves your feet extremely sore and causes pain and your feet to callous You can also way too easily over tie lace your shoes making the shoe way too tight I strongly dislike these shoes

The uppers are soft and flexible and feel like you are barefoot The cushioning is thick and mildly firm

have to return

The VaporMax flyknits are by far and away the best looking and most head turning shoes I have owned in my 30yr life Stylistically nothing comes close As far as wearability and comfort they are with the creme de la creme of shoes So light and so snug fitting The flyknit innovation changed the shoe game in my opinion besides my pair of suede LTR VaporMax I do not own a pair of shoes that are not Nike Flyknits I own six pairs of VaporMax and just ordered the multi colors yesterday

Exactly 6 months later a hole is in the toe not worth the money

I have had these shoes for over a month and they still look brand new They are my go to pair of sneakers for running working out and casual wear I have had ultraboosts yeezys and pureboosts but these vapormaxes are better in almost every way The flyknit is very durable the traction does not wear down and the air bubbles make the shoes unbelievably responsive The one problem I have is that every time I walk on a hard surface the shoes squeak that is not a big deal though Definitely worth the money

I currently have extreme neuropathy and arthritis in my feet years of running sports and dancing with very thin feet I wear a womens 13 AAA shoe which of course does not leave me any shoes to purchase in the marketplace aside from Nike mens shoes I can find Nike mens shoes that will fit my narrow foot I have worn Nikes since the 70I was in Cross Country These are by far the best I have worn It may take some a very short time for some to get accustomed to the air pockets I also bought a pair for my 18 year old grandson who is in cross country and he loves them

4 extra effort when walking

I loved them The only problems I had were they hurt the first few dyes I wore them they ran a bit small for me and the bubbles because deformed after I used them for a bit They would hurt once in a while Other than that one of the coolest shoes ever

Really was excited to get these shoes They are super comfortable but unfortunately after less than 4 months they are already breaking down I am not a runner so not even getting a lot of miles on them The air cushions on two of the shoes are popped Given the price I would expect these to last as long as all of my other nike

Love the shoe love Nike but in less than a month worn the left back heel bubble popped Not heavily worn and only worn 3 4 days a week

do not buy these shoes they are very cheaply made and fell apart very quickly

I LOVE THESE SHOES u2026 But they do not last u2026 by that I mean 3 4 months is all I get out of them one side or the other goes flat so if your run or even walk your going to feel it its the back of heel on every pair one side or the other I might be done buying anything air I have been wearing Nikes over 4o years my go to shoe Nike please go and look at my last orders I am always buying your newest products I walk and run over 5 miles 5 days a weeku2026 and have for the last 10 years niKEu2026 fix this please

NIke folksPlease consider bringing back Airmax flyknit asap

I suggest measuring your foot to the longest toe and then looking at the size chart and what you like or dislike about it

nice sneaker in sight but the worst sneaker that nike has manufactured it lasts almost nothing that vapormax technology in a month and I have been spoiled it is as if the internal air came out and simply everything went wrong Gaste so much for a shoe so but so poorly constructed

First let me say i think this is a great shoe and I really wanted it to work for me Unfortunately though it just is not right for the structure of my foot I have been wearing the flyknits for running for several years so I thought these would be just as good After having them on for 5 minutes both my big toes started to go numb It was odd but I figured they would break in and be fine After a half dozen runs nothing has changed my toes go numb quickly I think there is a different pressure in this shoe that the Free Run Flyknits do not have I would have just spent half the on my usual models

These shoes are a party for your feet Absolutely without question the most comfortable and fun shoe I ever have worn I got a 12 Fits literally like a glove I am at 290 lbs and 6 5 It is not for hiking or playing tennis Wonderful gym shoe and for wearing at home or about town Also I have serious neuropathy in my lower legs I have no feeling below my calves These shoes fit so well that I can bounce around like a ballerina Or almost Wonderful shoe

I really wanted to like this shoes great design and great concept Unfortunately like other reviews say these shoes are not made for running over 10 15 mins your feet will hurt and the heel support is just not there Doing cardio on an Eliptical or Stairmaster will give you a very painful day at the gym Bought a while back but wish I had return them right away

This seems like a great shoe but it just simply did not fit This has to be the narrowest shoe ever made I bought the size that I wear for all types of shoes and i barely could get my feet inside I have tons of Nike and have never had that issue

Great shoes A bit pricey and takes a few wears to break in but overall I am in love I do hope to see some more rare color options

These shoes are very uncomfortable and with the way they are made they make you put your weight on the front of your feet toes This has caused me to have back pain as well These are the first shoes I have ever had to return to Nike Very disappointed

Uncomfortable all I own is nike and these are the worst shoes I have ever bought save your money and your feet

Smooth running shoe and comfort from front to back

These are some great looking shoes On the darker color aways they do not get that dirty which is really good Although the shoe is quite expensive for not being very comfortable

Just as the others experienced putting on out of the box for the first time the tongue tore down the side Did not affect the wearing as well but how much thinner can we get on top NikeBought a back up pair of 2009s after my first pair and nothing since has compared to comfort and durability The first pair of those now 9 years old are still intact On the 1000 I have spent on Nike in the past year all the glued pieces of are coming apart

WOW I do not brag about how much I like shoes often at all but these are GREAT I own a pair of the first version and GREAT job on the design improvements

Best shoes I have worn since college and that was 1983 Comfortable very light Great colors to select from I have been running for 45 years and I wished I had these shoes when I was young

These are great running shoes I absolutely love the style and the comfort However I have only used them to run on the treadmill 3 4 times per week and have had them less than 2 months and the mesh on the toe is already tearing I am kind of sad and disappointed that I paid so much for them and within that short period of time they are already tearing

I have never written a review for anything but I felt this was definitely worth being the first First off I love these shoes and that comes from someone whobeen active most her life and has had many pairs of running shoes They look super stylish and train awesome especially when running The only sad thing is the mesh is already tearing maybe because of the intensity of my workouts though and for the price paid I would expect them to be a lot more durable then they actually are Overall I would love to own more pairs in different colors and would definitely invest in multiple pairs if the next shoes were more durable

At first i was like they not going fit me cause I am a big guy with fat feet and a little on the wide side but let me tell you these sneakers is so so nice in person and there neck breakers i gotta get more ASAP

I have a size 10 in womenThen ordered the utility edition in a men8 5 which is a women10 It was snug

I ordered my VaporMax Flyknit 2and was very excited to receive them Like other reviews below as soon as I put my left shoe on and pulled the tongue to lace it up the tongue ripped However I overlooked this as it did not seem to effect the shoe or its comfort too much They were very comfortable and I enjoyed my first run in them until I noticed that the left rear bubble had completely collapsed and deflated and now offered no support I inspected them thinking that I may have stepped on something but it was noted that entire side of the support blew out I have always ran in Nike shoes and really like the look and feel of these but I hope that the future ones are more durable and you do not lose an entire section of the shoe just from running in them

I love how they feel however when putting them the FIRST time I pulled my tongue up to tie my shoes and the tongue tore almost completely Looks like some serious quality control issues I am scared to replace because I just do not know how durable they are in the long run

Love the innovative sole definitely brings the competition between Nike and Adidas back the Sole does need a little time to break in but once it does it is very comfortable

I love the look however the fly knit style just does not work well for me cannot comment on the comfort or durability as they did not fit

Been using my VaporMax 2 0for a while now and I can genuinely say that they are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They are surprisingly great for my flat feet in terms of comfortability and stability

The quality of these are amazing The design and colors stand out MY GO TO PAIR

I will say initially when I put them on I was a little disappointed however after wearing them a few days I have a totally different opinion They are actually very comfortable I am 6 2 225 and the support my weight just fine I have played sports all my life and I get why some would initially say they feel like spikes but once your use to that feeling they are very functional Are they worth the price in my opinion probably not but if they hold up it would not be a bad investment

Honestly I am surprised by the other reviews I love the vapormax and find them incredibly comfortable I often wear them for traveling I just had a transatlantic flight and wore these on both legs I also think they are fantastic running shoes I have only run in my pair once but considered purchasing another pair just to run in

The design concept of these shoes is what drove me to purchase however from the moment I tried them on I was immediately regretful of ordering them These are one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have ever tried on and was forced to return them immediately Again love the concept but will have to look for another version or model to try out down the road after they have worked out the flaws with this design

I ordered online and waited 3 long days to arrive When I received them I was all gitty and excited to put them on Right about the time I was pulling the laces for a snug fit I held on the tongue and it tore A small amount of pressure was applied and I was extremely upset as I paid a premium for these shoes Go back to the drawing board and make them more durable Poor design

The plastic overlay with the swoosh on the inside part of the shoe digs into the ball of my foot and it seems like an unnecessary addition

I agree with another review posted about this shoe It literally feels like there is a rock in the shoe on the right midsole Very uncomfortable I tried to see if that would go away but it looks like it will not I will be returning these for a full refund and not an exchange

I bought a pair of the original Vapormax and saved them to wear on spring break However the right shoe feels like it has a rock in it and completely uncomfortable and painful It is in the middle outside portion and I am guessing the sole was installed correctly and one of the air pockets is rising into the shoe The left one is comfortable but I am unable to wear them because even sitting it is painful to wear the right shoe Extremely disappointed as I was so excited to wear them

I purchased these shoes hoping I would be able to run in them and bring my two mile time down I was sadly mistaken do not get me wrong it is a beautiful shoe and it looks good on you but it is not build for walking in running in they are best suited for sitting down or driving your car Seriously they will hurt you feet The shoe has potential but Nike missed the mark on these do not even bother if you do not believe me get on YouTube and listen to reviews on the shoe If I could get this shoe NO stars I would

I have worn air maxes for the last 12 years I ordered the vapormaxes under the assumption that they are the 2018 replacement I still pray they are not

Very comfortable and assist with back alignment when walking for prolonged periods of time Better if worn for physical activity as opposed to lounging

These shoes are the most comfortable I have ever worn it is like wrapping your feet in socks with clouds stuffed in the bottom I am a little concerned that the durability of the soles but even so if you wear them casually it should not be a concern

After wearing ultraboost and decided to try the NMDs This shoe was rather disappointing and returned this shoe for that reason

These are the dopest shoes in my collection I love the fit the look and the style great shoes

Since I dumped all my nike I am buying up some Addidas This is a smooth looking and feel good shoe I am really liking what Addidas is putting out on the market

Bought these for my son Size is right on to what he always wears He uses them for everything from basketball to running to casual activities and no complaints that his feet hurt like he has in the past Style and color is nice They have held up nicely to teenage wear and tear

i bought these for my boyfriend and he swears by them he says they are the most comfortable pair of sneakers he owns and would wear them everyday if he could

Long story short this shoe is a winner

These shoes are my favorite shoe This is the shoe all glory to God that I realized my back and knee pain would almost fully go away it is crazy keep up the great shoes adidas Bring back r1 older models those are my favorite And two do not change the price lol Even ultra boost I can make peace with but 200 to 220 to take things off my ultra boost and then charge me more chill b4 the hype ends up killing the fun of being a God fearing sneaker head God bless hope this helps lol sorry for the rant

Love the style and fit of this shoe Very comfortable

The shoes have a great silhouette and come in stylish color ways The have the boost cushioning which leads to higher levels of comfort and it introduces you to the boost technology well

I really love the look of the shoe however the boost cushioning on the NMD was not quite what I was expecting I was hoping the I would feel like I was walking on clouds but the boost did not fulfill my expectations do not get me wrong they were very comfortable and a great purchase but I would go with the ultraboost in the future

These shoes are very comfortable and stylish The navy blue is a great color and does not show dirt

Comfortable stylish Would def recommend copping a pair

These are my first pair of Adidas AMDMy friends kept recommending them to me so I gave them a chance and was surprisingly happy with my decision They are very comfortable light and I feel like I can walk or run a long way with them The stripes on the side are reflective I took a picture with the flash and realized the stripes turn white because of the flash They stand out and look clean I was at a Dodger game in a crowd of people but because of my shoes my friends spotted me

I bought the Collegiate Navy Olive Cargo White pair of NMDI have never cared about sneakers until I bought these shoes Holy Moly These shoes are so comfortable and yet so stylish I have wide feet but these shoes have plenty of room The size comes about 1 4 size bigger so plan ahead when buying Beautiful shoes that I would recommend to anyone

I first looked into this shoe because all my friends had it and they were sold out everywhere When I saw this pair of NMDI fell in love with them but when they came I was sort of disappointed The color on the website is very different from in person The actual color is a dark brown but on the website it looks like a black Overall the shoe was comfortable

i can walk all day in this shoe primeknit gives just the right amount of support and yet not restrictive

does not fit and brake very qiuikly so my kids did not like it eaither

I have been wearing ultraboost for a while the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I knew the NMDs were not gonna feel like that but loved the way they look The truth is they are still extremely comfortable and have become my go to daily runaround shoe as they fit with just about every pant or jogger i own Highly recommend Will be buying in other colors for sure

These shoes are comfortable to wear they are really convenient for me to put on and take off throughout the day

These are my first NMD so I am very excited to get other pairs they are soooo comfy feels like walking on clouds and the size was perfect for me I love the color and they are the best shoes I have owned so I hope to get more thankyou for the awesome shoes

you should buy at

One of the best colorways of 2019 and it just has such a clean look

Very good it is comfortable and goes well with almost everything

SUPER COMFORTABLE PEOPLE ALWAYS COMPLEMEMT MY SHOES

Simple shoe but looks good Its comfortable for everyday wear but it runs big so I recommend getting half a size smaller

NMD R1 are a comfortable and good looking shoe It runs big so I recommend going half size or a full size smaller than your normal size

Couple months ago I bought my first pair of NMD shoes and so far I have to tell that they are one of my favorite shoes ever They are very versatile works perfectly if you plan is use them to run also as fashion sneakers they look really amazing They run a little longer than your actual size I am 10 5 and the pair I got is 10 Now I am looking to all colors combinations and materials because I am definitely buying at least two more pairs

Best walking shoe ever and style is so nice and is comfortable

extremely comfortable and quick shipping Fit pretty well and feel super well on the foot

love the design and fit of the shoe around my feet

Great shoes Got them as a gift for a friend who loved them by the way

This shoe is perfect Size runs perfect extremely comfortable with the Boost midsole and a very flexible yet durable Primeknit upper I love this shoe and can not wait to get my hands on another pair

Easy too rock and very versatile sneakers lifestyle and even for the gym

very nice sole very comfortable nice color and fit overall great buy

Best shoes I have ever had Ill buy another one Recommend buying this shoes

I absolutely love this shoe This was my first NMD purchase back in August 2018 but I was sad to see these start to go I really loved how I could match this NMD solar pink colorway with just about anything and the shoe is alnost like a sock I think Adidas should make more colorways for this

I love these shoes because they are very comfortable and look just flat out awesome I love the off white color I have had them for 4 months now and they have held up very well They have a few stains but those are completely my fault These are by far my favorite shoes I have owned so far

Nice shoes and fit

Fantastic looking shoe They run a bit big in my opinion so I ordered 1 2 smaller then my tts fits perfect

Super comfortable great casual shoe Would recommend getting 1 2 1 size smaller than your true size

Sleek and comfortable love the colors and the fit on foot

Very comfortable and pretty durable Good for wearing in the gym running and for hours each day

The Primeknit molds to the size of your foot and is also super comfortable The shoe is also really comfortable with the Boost midsole and the quality is very good but could be a tad bit better

NMDare great They are the comfiest shoes

nmds all the way will purchase more recommend yess

the reason is because when I went to Las Vegas coz the weather there was too hot my those words on my shoes melted

Although they fit perfect and are very comfortable they do look a little wide and sometimes feel a bit chunky but overall I really enjoy the shoe and I am happy that I bought them as my first Adidas shoe

Fit and finish is perfect This is my 10th pair of NMD Love it

This shoe fits great the only part that does not us around the ankle when your foot is flexed during walking it feels a bit loose sometimes but other than that amazing it is a fresh take on nmd that still feels like a classic

Comfortable super stylish and quality is great

I love these Japan inspired NMD shoes I have gotten at least 5 7 compliments and almost everyone notices the Japan text on the shoes Very stylish Way to go Adidas

This pair stands up to the NMD reputation Plus they go with the while closet

one of the best nmd designs yetThis is a sure shot

I love the product but the first time I ordered them the order was cancelled for stock issues even though they were still in stock so I are ordered them and they came

This is my second pair of nmd I can not do workout without my nmd comfortable soooooo good

I think the STLT really is an awesome standard GR NMD because it is supremely comfortable and does not have any unnecessary add on plastic bits like the R1 lace holes The PK is perfect and stretchy flexes really well with the foot More color ways please

Great Looking shoes and comfort Recommend these for sure

The Quality of the shoe was not that good for a special edition should have grabbed regular triple blacks instead

These shoes are very light and make you feel like you are walking on air They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them on

Purchased 2 of these kind over the holiday for gift to my son They were happy to see Light weight and comfortable shoe

best purchase ever people stare at it good for it price when adding code

Size wise runs a little small so I might switch out for a size larger Other than that quality and comfort are on point Would definitely recommend

I really enjoy an update to the Japan R1s from a few years ago The fitting is true to size and the boost makes it a very comfortable sneaker

In love with the shoes but they came in with some smudges on them already Pretty disappointed but I guess overall they are nice

The shoe is great overall But there is just one flaw the adaptive knit gets caught easily on edges of things like for instance a door or sticks on the ground and ruins the knit Although It is fixable The laces are way too long for the shoe itself I ordered myself a pair of laces from lace lab and they are great Unlike the primeknit used in the ultra boost these shoes do not make your feet sweat They have great ventilation I would totally recommend these shoes to anyone who wears them casually And they are great for your all day stand type of job They will not let you down

The shoes are very comfortable Also the they go with a lot of my outfit that I wear

These shoes are so comfortable that I have bought 2 pairs The NMD line has the best looking shoes and the most comfortable shoes Adidas is ALWAYS my choice of attire

Another great colorway from the already classic NMD R1 line

I slip these on all the time Multi colored is great very fun Great walk around shoes

The shoes provide a good style while providing comfort with the boost

I love my shoes they are simply eye catching and everyone compliments them simply great

Usually a womens 7 12 or 8 Wanted this shoe its triple black with black soles Ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly In love

These shoes are very comfortable and stylish I am on my 4th pair

Although I do not own a pair yet I have tried several on and they have been so amazing I want to have several my self They were so comfortable and versatile that they hugged your feet but were not over tight they were perfect

I like this shows because it is so soft and comfortable that can protect my feet so well

Really like the looks of this shoe However wearing them playing basketball running I would not recommend

Lol So when I got these I received a half size down from what I had ordered However I must say they fit perfect These NMDs are one of my favorite colorways and the comfort is fantastic I mean it has boost so

I would like to return these fit to small even though I buy the same size shoes for all adidas for whatever reason these are to small

I like the price point of the sneaker as it definitely is very comfortable sneaker and looks great on feet

do not let the look fool you these are the comfiest shoes out there I can wear them for upwards of 12 hours a day without taking them off I own 3 pairs The material and the boost soles hold up well

Got these shoes for my birthday and love wearing them everyday around campus

They are comfortable lightweight and stealthy I really recommend them Can someone please explain to me what STLT stands for

This shoes are great Beautiful and comfortable Totally recommend

Stylish shoe great for neighborhood vibes go Adidas 

This shoe was a great purchase overall It fits nicely matches with anything and is still unique The only problem I noticed was the insole There are small shallow holes inside the shoe that I could feel when I walk I am sure this could easily be fixed with an after market insole

true to size and one of the best shoes i have purchased

Great looking shoes and really great I can not get over how good the are

Personally I like the nmd style wise more than the ultra boost The price is more affordable and you still get a very comfortable shoe One of my favorites

I am a huge fan of the Boost sole These shoes are extremely comfortable My only criticism is that they are a little on the narrow side for my feet Otherwise a great shoe for the price

This shoe was is so comfortable and has good support for running and fashion for comfort

The shoe purchase was not satisfying awful cloth like material and wrinkled a lot

nmd are my go to shoe and feel great walking around

Good quality and comfortable recommend going a size down for them

Probably one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever bought Feels like I have nothing on my feet they weigh so little Style wise people stop and compliment them so thumbs up there

These have a similar boost to the ultra boost but do not feel as structured I like them and feel very great

These are some of the most comfortable light weight breathable and style shoes I have ever owned

I would say the pros outweigh the cons and overall this shoe is a work of art The comfort level is like i have never seen before It also looks good

The fit was amazing the knit upper was snug but not too tight I love the boost sole it makes the shoe very comfortable and walking running effortless Also it is cheap compared to ultraboosts but they are just as good

The best the best the best shoes I wore in 48 years

The shoe is very stylish as well as very comfortable

the best choice i have ever made i have 22 pairs of nmdand i were them every day

It has all great features and fits great I love them

Great shoe to do casual walking and light running

very comfortable and again great design good work

Super comfortable well made matches the jacket I just bought Now I need to find the black ones

I Will recommended this product to my friend

This product is very comfortable and the price is great for this quality of shoes

I liked the design and the color scheme overall the material used for the shoe seems to be very durable

This shoe fits somewhere between the 17 PW Tennis Hu one of the best fitting PK and the NMD R1 textile The length and width are near not completely perfect with full weight on foot I also purchased the TS1 GTX hoping it would fit like this does This shoe feels much better so I returned the TS1 Sorry I did provide a decent review though I prefer lo top runners to hi top anything There is a subtle pink accent woven into the core black I wish it was more pronounced but I already own the Hu BY2672 the Hu HOLI MC and the Lucas Premiere that give me more of a color POP People are sleeping on this shoe which is good for those who simply dig a nice fitting and stylish lifestyle runner I would buy another color way if any of the others had colored boost

There super comfortable easy to combine with and also good for nice workouts

NMDs are my favorite They are so comfortable can be worn all day with no problem Love this colorway

NMD R1 never fails at its comfort and are always stylish with what you wear can match them with most of everything I wore these for a long period of time and my feet and knees did not feel a thing felt like walking on spongy cushioning the whole time

NMD R1 are super comfy I can wear these for along period of time standing or being active I wore these during work busy hours where I had to stand for hours and it did not bother my feet or knees at all The plus thing to these that they are very stylish and go with almost everything you want to wear them with

Very comfy and very stylish I can wear these for a long period of time without my feet and knees hurting These are also very stylish that matches with most of everything you would want to wear them with

Prefect with with flexible material Insoles can get uncomfortable if being worn casually throughout the day but if just wearing for a few hours are perfect

These nmd are extremely comfortable and great looking The prime knit and boost are very soft Great shoes to purchase

Great product I will recommend this product to my friends

Great comfort and a very good looking pair of shoes

I LOVE my NMDS This is my third pair I wont wear anything but Adidas now

I got these recently and they are amazing The primeknit is very soft and stretchy Great Shoes

the comfort of these shoes are amazing I can stand for hours in a day without my knees or my feet hurting The style is beyond the look it casual at the same time it gets that double take look from others

Best every day shoe Very comfortable and stylish

So Comfortable Very great color Wish they did not sell out so quickly

Good quality great color and really comfortable shoes

This shoe is comfortable the back heel was initially bothersome but once the shoes were broken in they were comfortable and easy to wear

Adidas never fails me I love pretty much every NMD they drop I have been looking for a black NMD for a bit It would be better if the whole shoe is black or at least make a staple black NMD because that would be awesome

Got these for the wife she constantly wears them to work out

Feels great easy to put on and can wear with anything

It fit great but after walking in it for just a few minutes it did not give that comfort I was looking for that usually NMD R1 shoes have

Absolutely love this shoe Its like wearing an invisible sock all day

These shoes are very comfortable I loved them I think you should get them

Very comfortable Like walking on a cloud Son was very happy

nmd is best for walking or running shoes very light and comfortable

Great shoes that look great on your feet Made of goos materials and work well in the color because even when they get a little dirty because of materials they still look great

it is Adidas and it is very comfortable I will order a second pair soon

it is popular everyone wear it To be in trend and fashionable period

I like it just ran a little small for me I like how lightweight but a little tight

Cool all black look with a hint of hot pink can not go wrong Looks good with black Adidas tracksuit

Comfortable stylish durable They go with any outfit This is one of multiple pair I own I love them

It feels so nice on the feet and it feels like you are just wearing a comfy sock I have another primeknit shoe but this one is much better fitting

Toe comes undone from the fabric eventually but these got good use Took out the laces and still fit nicely Bought them again

Really good original shoes Feel comfortable wear it

Nmd have always been well worth the ticket These ones are aswell

My son put a hole in each shoe on the bottoms within 4 months of having them These are very comfortable shoes sine they have the boost technology but I feel like all boost shoes they always seem to fall apart from the soles

I had to order up one half size bigger because they ran out of my size but they still fit pretty well The sleek design of the NMD is what always has me coming back for more

The show has hot pink that is looks different from the pictures It is very comfy and amazing quality

Wear them for work at the gym and if feels like I am walking in clouds

I love the product because it is reasonable in price and the quality is Amazing

Amazing product I love it Very comfortable I definitely recommend

The Adidas NMD R1 is hands down one of my favorite models of shoes I have ever tried I fell in love with the first pair that I purchased and now have 5 pairs in various colors of the same shoe I love the Boost bottom sockfit upper and how they fit on my feet in particular and I recommend them to everyone

These shoes are super comfortable I love NMDs I have several pair and I keep buying more

I love the product because it is reasonable in price and the quality is Amazing I Love these Shoes

Awesome looking shoes Great to wear anywhere Only complaint is the arch support can hurt your feet after a while if you have flat feet like me

These shoes are very comfortable I have wide feet and the shoes are not too tight The cushioning of the shoe is perfect

Awesome colors Very comfortable Would recommend to anyone

Comfy and clean

Looks great with color combination Easy to keep clean Comfortable and light but supportive

Nmds are the most comfortable and affordable sneakers by far

I regularly walk over 20k steps per day and I have not found a more comfortable shoe I get lots of compliments on the style I really like this colorway I will be buying more NMDs in the future

I liked the product because of how it looks Very clean

Comfortable but the mesh material wrap wears out easy

I just bought this because I needed shoes for work and they were on Sale nothing like the ultra boost

I usually size down a half in these I did so again and they are way too tight Sadly they do not have them in stock anymore I am not sure what to do

I really like the NMD This shoes is nice and very comfortable but I wish it was slightly higher quality as it started degrading after only a few wears

The Style is amazing perfect shoe It feels very comfortable and definitely stands out in the crowd

Very comfortable and light weight Love to wear this shoes except rainy season

Very nice color combination it is white with a little touch of color Colors may seem weird but it matches very well

I was very excited about ordering these shoes The shoes came and I noticed a glue around the shoe that just looks terrible The shoe it is self feels very creap compared to my other NMD

This was my first NMD pickup I would have been more satisfied with the prineknit version These shoes are very stiff and are quite difficult to put on The comfort is there as it does possess the Boost technology however it does not compare to the comfort of Ultra Boost I am happy I paid the price I paid for these however these NMD probably will not get too many wears

Been wanting these shoes for months now and now they I own a pair My favorite

I like the design and it is also very comfortable Fits well too

Between the xr1 and the pk uppers these shoes are a great compliment to any outfit

This is the 15th pair of nmds I own and love every one of them best shoe series ever

Comfort style reasonable prices You can go wrong

Great product very stylish just what you need to go to the club or for a run

Great looking shoe Great fit and finish Only issue shoe fit a little small I would recommend a half size bigger

I bought these they look and feel great but it looks more pink than chalk white

Great colorway the material is nice and keeps it shape Recommending to size 1 2 down for a snug fit Runs slightly big Great boost feel

These are really comfy and the look awesome I will buy again

A little wise for the size but a great fit overall

I love that these shoes are unisex and that I can share them with my boyfriend

Really like the colors on these shoes They fit really good and are comfortable They can be dressy or lazy look Perfect

Love the prime nit They fit really nice and are super comfortable

Love it this purchase was for my husband Christmas gift and he loved it

This was my first pair of NMDs I own several pairs of Ultraboost First off the NMDs lack the arch support Ultraboost have and feel less cushioned in the toe box I have added an insole to help with the arch support The insole insert also helps with the weird fit of these shoes The Primeknit without the insert seems to flatten out and collapse on foot My feet are a little bit narrow Not sure what it is but the fit in these shoes is a bit off I will be sticking to Ultraboost from now on Lesson learned

What can I say this shoes is really comfortable and I like the design

These shoes fit perfect The colorway is very unique and it is look to be very good spring shoes I like how the it is off white and you do not have to worry about it getting dirty I highly recommend nmd r1

I got a lot of compliments on the shoes since the first day I wore them Amazing pair

back of shoe irritated and gave me a bruise at the back of my foot

Bought for my 16 year old son Great for everyday wear and stylish too

These do not have insoles and if they did they would be so much more comfortable The color also has a lot of pink woven in that is not shown accurately in the picture It is legit full on pink Not the biggest fan of that

I really like this shoe it fit perfectly comfootble but the just the color It cardboard brown

As long as she loves it then its good Nice color though she liked the one with pink

does not look clean and shading seems different than in the picture

My son Loves these shoes He thinks this is one of the most comfortable shoes he has owned

These shoes give great ankle support and it is good for wear and tear

I like it just because of the way it fits my foot

I have to say this is one of the best shoe i got i love this colors

Something that is comfortable for everyday casual use

I love the colors and the fit it is perfect I just wish they would clean up some of the residue or cuts they make to the midsole and heel area just because in some cases it looks sloppy

I bought those but the sole looks kind of weird on the inside looks like a hole and feels a little unconfortable

Love it i am roking it it like a supastar lol

Very light weight and yet durable Comfortable yet stylish

The shoe itself was a little too long However it is very comfortable and I got it for a good price

I have a few pairs of NMD and this pair has been excellent as have the rest

Comfort and look You can wear them casually or use it for working out and exercising

The shoe looks great on but there is way to much extra room around the toes It does not form around your foot well and could only be used if you are sitting around or walking short distance I would not recommend this shoe

perfect everyday shoe goes with anything super comfy

A great shoe have not worn it too much so not having an issue with the quality but see what happens

Style is different from other athletic shoes and even other adidas

Flexible shoe love the different colorways and super comfortable

The color was alot better in person Its a cream color

Very stylish and comfy Great quality I always love adidas NMD

Colors are very bright and sizing is not perfect

These shoes look good and feel good for any occasion weather your exercising or just out in the city I would like to see more simple colors and to me less is more

I would recommend buying these shoes only if you plan to sport them they are really good shoes

I really like the new pair of shoes I purchased They are comfortable and very stylish

Its a comfortable shoes and of nice quality Too bad I have to return it cause my husband does not like the color of the neon

the shoe quality is amazing but the primeknit around the ankle is loosing up

The material wrinkles and is loose looks weird Sole is comfy true to nmd standards

Very comfortable and super clean sneakers awesome look

I own plenty nmd shoes these are pretty clean looking Highly recommended

Not really because small size so I end of give it to my friends

Very good my friend and I like it I will buy again

These shoes fit and feel great Got them for 50 off and could not be happier Would definitely recommend even at the full price tag

Great looks and very comfortable Will definitely recommend

Runs slimmer than thought not as comfortable or cushion as other running sneakers Ie vapormax presto

Not good quality Size much bigger than be normal shoes size

Love the shoe Fits perfectly fine I have no complaints

First time to buy Adidas online and it is a nice experience Good looking and comfortable to fit in

My 6th pair of NMDs so stylish and cozy perfect for the gym or the streets

Light weight and this dual color looked alive With 50 discount worth it

They look great and the price was right and comfortable

Just a real clean but stylish look Good thing is about these shoes is that you can ware them ware them with anything You can dress up or down Very versatile

Absolutely love these shoes fit perfectly super comfy can wear then all day without feeling my feet tired They are amazing

True to size and very comfortable like all the NMDS Love the color which is a little bit more Creamy than what it looks like in the picture

These shoes look great and are very comfortable I have gotten complements on them Good value for purchase However one of the eyelits looked like it was burnt or torn I did not think it was a huge issue however I wish that they had come more perfect or just looked over better

Perfect fit and super comfortable They are a really cool look

Feels like a sock and fits like a sock if you want them to fit like that then you probably will have to go down a size but perfect for wide feet

A great shoe that looks great and is very comfortable

best pair of products out there highly recommend for comfort

Love love love all this shoe So comfy and will definitely be getting more

the main reason why it is uncomfortable for me is because i got half a size too small i usually wear size 8 so i got a size 8 but an 8 5 would have been much better

These are my first peer of NMDi am more of an ultra boost fan I like that mid range sneaker feel I get from these NMDof comfort and support Definitely a plus for me

Its super comfortable Also good for light training

I would not recommend Not comfortable attractive or fit well

Besides the fact that it is a bit difficult to actually put your foot into the shoe because the shoes have no tongue everything about the NMD r1 are perfect

Comfortable and good looking shoes I would recommend these

They fit true to size and are really confortable I would recomend these shoes to anyone who is looking for something confortable and stylish

Lightweight and just slips on not sure if I would run in these I do train in gym with them

It goes great with most pants and very easy to style with

nmd are the most comfortable shoes Ive ever owned The sole is soft but supportive

I LOVE how comfortable ther are and they look really cool as well I have gotten many compliments

Love nod but this Color is not same as in the pic

Perfect Just what I expected from adidas A great comfortable sneaker

The shoe is pretty comfortable but is a bit wide on a narrow foot like mine

I like everything about the shoes I have no negative comments about it

There sneakers are extremely stylish and very comfortable

I like the product because it fits perfect so comfortable and go a good sale on the shoe and was always a NMD fan

I normally wear a 13 or 14 I ordered these in a 13 and they did not fit at all They were perfect for my son who has another pair of Adidas shoes in size 11

ConsLacing system creates an odd shape when looking down at them on feet not a good look do not go true to size 1 2 size up make this 100x more comfortable

Boost makes things very comfortable The primeknit upper makes it easy to slip on while still being snug to the foot

Nothing can go wrong with nmds

Bought these for my son he loves them and wears them all the time

I like the product for the color comfort and design

Not as comfortable as ultra boost seems a bit cheap as well

Would like wide width if available and cushion insole

The NMD in my opinion is the most comfortable shoe out there

like the style and how comfortable they feel One of the most comfortable shoes I have

I love nmd style however I think are very expensive

Ever since being exposed to the Boost of the Adidas brand I have been hooked It is very comfortable and a well made product Only flaw I could see is possible more ankle support Very nice shoe and very good product

I bought these shoes for my son He loves them

Worst shoes I have had from adidas I have about 20 pairs The whole NMD shoe collection is not up to par The insole has holes for some reason which makes them really uncomfortable to wear Also the outer fabric on these does not conform to the foot I LOVE the UltraBoost those shoes are the best NMDs not so much

Great product at a great price fast shipping

My daughter absolutely loved the light comfortable fit

Looks great They give a nice clean look paired with jeans

Great shoes They are very lightweight and super comfortable

What a nice looking shoe Very stylish and great quality Very comfortable

These are some amazing shoes I have only put them on a few times but the feel really stable and comfortable I can definitely see myself getting something similar to this soon

These shoes look good and feel great to walk around in

Love the feel very comfortable shoe HOWEVAH Stephan A Smith voice I made the mistake of not taking too good a look before purchasing them The no tongue look is a bit off putting kind of weird But the main thing I completely missed like an idiot was the color scheme I thought it was gray and black throughout not noticing the solar pink Woulda been a lot cooler if it was but comfy nonetheless

Very Comfortable to do sport Nice Nice Nice Tennis

The style is great and I love the color way material is top quality and feels so comfortable a little tough getting my foot in but using the pull tab helps a lot

These are my first pair of NMDS I ordered them have a size up because that is how I like my shoes and they do fit quite well When I first tried them on I thought they were so comfy Quite frankly I was shocked I have never owned a shoe this comfy My only complaint is the actual pattern on the shoe From the pictures the pure black and pink blended together quite nicely but in reality it creates kind of a harsh line and I do not really like it I have used them a couple times and I am used to it it is not that bad anymore

Color on the shoes is different than on the picture

I usually need wide sizes so I was hesitant to get these but they fit and feel amazing it is only been a few days so I can not speak for durability but they are lightweight and feel almost like I am wearing nothing at all it is like wearing a sock but with a sole

Nice pair of shoes a bit narrow on the feet But i would still recommend

Lovely shoes Getting a lot of compliments The shoes make me feel like I am walking on air

Love the Knit and the way it hugs my foot Please have another 50 NMD promo code to buy more

Hurt my feet Not so comfortable shoes Why I can not write simple Why review need to be longer Weird

it is like walking in clouds that you do not realize are there

Shoe is super comfortable love the colorway on it

These shoes were great but they just did not look like the pictures on the website They were far more pink than they appeared in the pictures I ended up returning them because they were too pink for me

Great shoe but execution was off due to no insoles and no tracking info

The opening of the shoe is way too small I have average feet size 10 I was unable to put to shoe on

The shoes were great its is comfortable and it was affordable

Although the shoes are a little tight they are very stretchy and flexible They look great with shorts and pants and are very comfy

Awesome color way and super comfy Definitely love all the nmd

COMFORT SIZE QUALITY WILL RECOMMEND TO MY FAMILY

it is a very good shoe very comfortable I will comeback and get a different color way

Great quality material The shoe is very comfortable My only complaint is that the back of the shoe rubs against my Achilles causing some slight chafing

it is cool and popular It is also comfortable Worthwhile I love it

They are shoes that are good Additionally they are not bad shoes

The strap on the back of the shoe ended up rubbing my skin raw and giving me blisters I had to purchase material to sew over it just to make these wearable

Affordable version of ultra boost Highly recommended

The color is khaki not white The material was baggy because it is not a primeknit with led to wrinkling

Nice colors the 3 stripes shine super comfy true size

They are very comfortable and I get a lot of compliments

they are very comfortable This is my 5th or 6th pair already

Fit perfectly Own 3 pair already Highly recommended Look better in person

Looks ok but comfort is not there Inside of heel rubs and the light boost cushioning vs ground does not seem even close to ultra boost or air cushioning

The Primeknit upper runs too loose in my opinion especially at the forefoot Comfortable yes but needs better lockdown support and a grippier more durable outsole on the bottom

Love these shoes and this color way is the best can not wait to buy more

Great shoes with right price I saw from a friend who is a shoe fanatic tried once and decided to buy

It fits great and was the exact style i was looking for I can wear them with almost any outfit I have already ready received so many compliments on them I would definitetly buy these shoes

Love these sneakers great for spring summer fall sneakers Lightweight and comfortable Knit material is a great fit and adds even more comfort

Bought for my 10 year old grandson A very awesome surprise he received and could not be happier Fit and comfort are super

Light weight and soft BOOST ever The shoe laces are good quality to keep my feet on spot during running

They fit perfect and love the fit Exactly what I was looking for

The shoe is just the best it looks really good and is very comfortable

The fit of the upper was very comfortable There was enough cushion for everyday activities Overall a very good shoe

These sneakers are light and comfortable The upper is more comfortable than that of the standard non knit nmd sneakers in my opinion and the sock like ankle gives an added touch I will not be wearing these in the winter months but they will be perfect for spring and summer

These are one of my favorite NMDs the foam color supports provide great comfort and the color blocking goes great with the chalk knit Plus the reflective stripes add a nice touch

I like the product because the shoes have a good color and they are easy to clean

Comfortable and Fashionable All about the BOOST Adidas makes a great product

Awesome

Very comfortable and very good looking would wear it everyday

I love the NMD R1s They are now my preferred sneaker I would like to see more colors and more sneakers with the black sole that are not priced higher because of the color of the sole It would also be nice to have some water proof pairs as well

Comfortable and stylish shoes my 22 year son picked out He loves this style and color

Great shoe but had to return My fault I did not realize the camo on the back was so CAMO Not a fan Maybe in a different color

Adidas comfortable shoe nice color scheme and would buy them all

The prime knit in these shoes is amazingly comfortable but does not offer a lot of support so do not try to run or do lateral movement 1 2 size too big

I like this shoe because it is fashionable and comfortable

The picture shown on the page makes the shoes look like they are woven with red fabric with the red fabric being hardly noticeable could not be further from the truth The shoes have hot pink fabric woven into the shoes that are extremely noticeable Of course it was my fault for not checking exactly what color the description said But if I order shoes I expect them to look like their photo

I am going to start with that I got these on sale I got them for 56 so that is my mindset when reviewing them I have so far found them to be pretty comfy even with the laces tightened to accommodate the sizing error When I first put them on I found them to be looser than expected leading them to run about a half size big The coloring is incredible and definitely something unique so if you tend to run with grey or navy blue shoes in your fleet these will spice up your color scheme The Boost sole is of course a highlight looking incredible on the outside and feeling even better on the inside Overall I would recommend these shoes if you are looking at them just get a half size down

I bought these for my son so far he loves them He has a narrow foot and these fit great

The boost is well worth the purchase for the comfort

This has become my fave pair of shoes next to my Ultraboost it is so comfortable and I get compliments on it every time

Good shoe but the insole is horrible the octagon cutouts in the insole are uncomfortable on my heels I should have sent them back

The shoe looked like it was definitely used instead of new There were a bunch of dirt marks on the side of the shoes the EVA plugs were wrinkled and part of the bottom sole was peeling off the shoe can not even exchange the shoe now that it is sold out

The shoe was absolutely amazing but the one and actually the only problem was that the shoe did not have good traction So when I was playing a game in gym at my school I was sliding all over the place Other than that it is an amazing shoe

Love them great shows just had to order a size down work they are perfect

I love this shoe for everything Whether it be going out to do errands or just doing things around the house or even working in them Awesome comfortable shoe that is also very stylish and goes well with Christmas themed if

These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly Thank you Adidas for killing the shoe game once again

great quality and comfort one of the best shoes to explore

The boost makes them insanely comfortable and they are easy to rock with anything Although not as comfy as ultra boosts the debatably look just as good

They are comfortable and feel smooth when I walk I feel like I am walking on air

Some of the most comfortable shoes I own The boost soles give the comfort to walk for miles and the shoes are so lightweight they just feel like socks

These shoes are my new favorite shoes ever I have worn other brands of knit shoes and these out do those shoes by a long shot I currently own two pairs that is how comfy they are My only problem is that there is not three defined stripes on the sides I feel like that could give some people the impression that they are fake or off brand But comfiest shoes ever right now

This shoe is so amazing and matches every outfit I have

The shoes seemed to run a half size too small Had to sell them to a co worker Super bummed because I wasted my only 20 off coupon

The material used on the upper is very flexible but also strong at the same time so to speak These shoes are very easy to put on and they are very comfortable

Color for red was actually maroonas a result I never wore them and returned

I got the white cream with red and I love them The width is a little wide but other than that they are great

Amazing they feel great and look even only convert is keeping them so clean and so good looking But that is not a bad issue at all

Imagine glueing a sock to a rubber sole that is what these are like

Love the design and very comfortable Definitely recommend

Best Shoe ever designed by Adidas Loved it Highly Recommended

Love the colorway and it is definitely super clean However maybe the NMD model can utilize a more comfortable insole

Fit is just a tiny bit smaller at the toe than I prefer but there is still room It took a day to get used to break in these shoes especially at the heel support but after that day they are some of the most comfortable shoes I own

Excellent shoes and very comfortable to wear every day

it is very comfortable and very nice looking but the hole to put your foot in is kind of small It is hard to put the shoe on initially because of this

the comfort and the overall look of the shoes is what makes it one of my favs

Personally I love NMDI have had 3 pairs yet the hardest part is cleaning them They stain WAY too easily one time I was cleaning them and I stained them with water I love the design and comfortability yet they are to manage Despite all this adidas is still my favorite brand and I like what they are doing

Great comfortable shoe fits well and color is perfect Arrived fast like them a lot

Great shoes and so comfortable I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned aside from the heel cuff The primeknit is super soft the Ultraboost sole is great but the heel cuff right where it meets the heel tab will give you blisters if you are not careful Should be padded with something softer there

Just cool

Nice shoes very comfortable for whether you are going for a walk run or just doing things around the house Fits likes socks nice and stretchy upper and the boost is comfortable perfect for the price

My son loves the comfort I did had to exchange them for a smaller size The exchange process was hassle free

They ok but not true to size I wear a 10 1 2 and it is way to big

I like the colors and how they look I like how they and they look good with the clothes I wear

Love the look and comfort The match with everything

Love the NMD R1 especially in this camo looking forward to future releases

Good shoe I have 4 different pairs Highly recommend

I like this product because it is very comfortable

Perfect fit but would recommend going a half size down

The shoes are very easy to get in and out of I can wear these shoes all day and my feet will not hurt

Shoes are comfortable but there is a lot more room for improvement in that aspect Looks are perfect These shoes are meant for lifestyle streetwear and you can dress up or dress down with these shoes

It was one of my first nmds and they have not been a disappointed They are very comfortable but also have a unique look that it is distinct Great overall

Good price really comfortable and my husband love them

they are very cool they are so stylish and very great

They fell apart the first time I put them on They are the worst shoe I ever had The texture can not of the shoe can not hold the glue I have had them for two weeks and I need a new pair

I normally wear a 10 5 so I went with that The shoe felt good but if you like more of a snug fit go down half a size

So I live in south Florida and having shoes that are comfortable are paramount because you are going to encounter hot and humid weather and freezing A multiple times a day I have wide feet so I was a bit concerned initially about how much Primeknit would really stretch After one wear those concerns were gone Supremely comfortable shoe I can not say how enjoyable these are to wear thank you Adidas

disappointed in the color spent a lot of money on these but was deceived by the color

I like it so far it looks like a shoe that was bought from Payless it is just super comfortable

comfortable and all that good stuff i would recomend

they are stylish and popular I do not know why because they are uncomfortable

Because is nice and super comfortable compare with others sneakers

I got this product thinking it was all black but when I received the shoes it had a hot pink fabric woven in the shoe it is my fault for not reading the description but it would still be nice if there was a better picture posted for the shoe

I also love the color way of this shoe mostly black with a pop of pink

I really loved this shoe when I received it The solid black upper with pops of color was just my style However I missed in the description that these were not prime knit As a result I had to return them and my correct size was not available Maybe next time

These kicks are stylish light weight and super comfy I ordered both colors

I do not like it because they were not would correctly Sole was glued wrong

I love this product because of the comfort quality and style

As a sneaker phanatic these are one of the most comfortable and stylish sneaker I have ever worn I feel like I am walking on a cloud Since they were half off I just may have to get another pair I highly recommend this sneaker to everyone

Love these Shoes I will be buying more nmd

These shoes have a very nice knitting that allows air to flow through them Although I am not a fan of the built in insoles which can make them too roomy sometimes I would definitely recommend buying these Very great quality and clean look I am impressed

Have only owned these shoes for only a couple weeks and the upper tore a hole after a few uses The primeknit upper is very comfortable however is not a quality material when it comes to durability I did enjoy the shoes while they lasted just very disappointed at how fragile they were hoped to wear them longer

They are extremely comfortable and look great with whatever outfit you chose

Awesome shoes with great style and design plus creativity

So ive been wanting theses shoes since last year and my girlfriend finally bought me a pair let us just say I want several pairs now But the only thing that would could be better is when you put it on I do not like that it is a band around it to insert your foot because my foot is big and sometimes it is hard to get my foot in But these shoes are great just a little expensive

I like it because it was not too pricey and has a very nice style

Awesome shoes Perfect fit highly recommended Now I am just writing to make the review long

Super comfy and they look great I bought one pair and left the store but could not resist to buy another pair for my brother and turned back to get them

Well made shoe definitely expect that for 130 but very well made looks good with shorts and pants

Very good fit extremely comfortable Very light and flexible

Just what my son wanted Good quality and comfort

Super comfortable and light Great quality as always

These are the most comfortable running shoes I now own

Awesome buy a 1 comfort Highly recommended you will not regret

The best shoes ever so comfortable I have different brands and I was not satisfied with thise shoes once I tryed this Adidas on I was very impressed and I didnt think twice that is what I wanted Highly recommend and I am already planning for my next purchase of the same type NMD adidas shoes

So comfortable and stylish at the same time which you do not find often

buy it they are the better of better of better of better thou

The shoes look very nice but what you cannot are is that when the shoes come they look orange Overall comforatble

Very comfortable my foot fit perfectly in the shoe I wanted

I bought the wrong size and the store ran out of my size so I was forced to return them but they were stylish and I regret having to return them

extremely comfortable great product strongly recommended

They are comfy and perfect fitting for my wide feet

The shoes are very comfortable I plan on buying more of this shoes

So I ordered these shoes for work as I walk alot they have held up pretty well to the wear and tare and lots of walking Best shoe you will ever get

Very comfy and neat definitely worth the buy I am thinking about getting a next color

Love the shoes but the the boost pod will get scraped up i they go on concrete

it is perfect and fits well The quality is perfect and width is good

I gave this to my mom for her birthday She absolutely loved it She wore it on her birthday party

I ordered these for my husband He was skeptical at first because they fit like a sock and he thought they may not hold up but they are not only comfortable but a sturdy shoe He wears them every day

I like them because they are comfortable I am more than likely going to buy more in the future

Very comfortable The shoes can fit anyone foot no matter how wide

Awesome shoe comfortable and get many compliments on them

I bought it for my husband and the first time he used it he got bruise on the tip of his ankle

The shoes are very comfortable and very stylish I love wearing them

I love these shoes so far They ran a half size big for me so I went down half a size I think it is due to the primeknit material They are very light These are my second favorite shoes behind my Yeezy Boost 350

I wanted to like these but the prime knit upper sits really loose around the heel and mid foot and does not provide anything even remotely close to support The result is that your foot is swimming in a saggy sack of a shoe upper although the fabric is cool Also since it is an integrated upper and there is no tongue you can not compensate by tying them a little tighter Had to return them

Boost technology is the most comfortable tech on the market and the NMD model offers great sturdy support

Love the material on top Super comfortable to use and great design

I really like the color and the fit a lot Has good ankle support as well

These shoes look great I bought them as a gift and the size was perfect The colors really look outstanding

This shoe is an excellent purchase great quality great comfort and you can wear it with anything and it will look good

I just bought them and i already love them This is my 2nd pair of nmdand i bought them because i was fully satisfied with the nmd r1 gum pack white

Great comfortable shoe We have quite the collection of these

My son loved it got a lot of compliments at school

Very comfortable Durable and stylish I have four pairs

I like this shoe because the way it looks on foot and the comfortablity

I love this product because the colorway is perfect and it is super comfortable I sometimes forgot I have a shoe on

Good looking And great colors with comfort for the gym or just hanging

These are nice daily sneakers I wear them when I am going to have a long day on my feet Nice look and very comfortable

NMD uncared are extremely comfortable for all day wear

I love it the perfect example of COMFORT STYLE

One of the worst NMDs i have ever ordered Stitching coming out and glue on the soles

I love it because of the sound of the shoes and they are comphy

NMDs i mean what can i see about themThey rooooooock

Just got them in the mail The gray camo detail in the back wow Love wearing this with shorts Must have

I love these shoes Not super easy to put on but once on they hold tight They feel like I am wearing slippers but in a really great way

These shoes are comfortable and really stylish but the knit affords for holes to form in the front and side areas with not much stress These are worn as casual shoes around the house and running errands no sports they are essential garbage and we have not owned them for a week

The other NMD shows are so comfortable but these were to small They were listed as mens but they fit like the womens shoes I also purchased to small If I knew they were womens sizes I would have ordered a bigger size

very comfortable shoe good size to normal fit would recommend

The shoe is of decent quality and super comfy but hate the black Definitely can tell the difference between these and the primeknit uppers in terms of comfort

These shoes are super light and are really comfortable Having said that I was a little disappointed with the boost technology as the one in the EQTs is far superior As other people mentioned I went a half size down and they fit perfectly The shoes were a little more pink than I thought they would be but I decided to keep these pair of shoes as the comfort was unparalleled

I wish I knew this shoe was so wide before purchased

The shoe was also wide compared to other shoes in this line

They are very very comfort very nice looking and they are so easy to put on and take off I do not even have to tie the laces My only complain is they have a very small irregularity in my left shoe a little piece of dry glue But I guess this can vary in a lot of shoes

These shoes are one of my all time favorite pairs to wear They are very comfortable and stylish I get compliments every where I go with them on Order 1 2 size smaller because shoe does run big

I really like the feel of these and they are really light weight I use them at either the gym or just to wear out with an outfit No matter how you wear them they work Really comfortable shoes

Great shoes overall Look nice and the fit is good

it is good design with good quality very confortable

It is the best shoe for running Really nice shoe

I love this shoe so much my very first nmd I have always heard about the boost in these shoes and they were right will buy more

Great fit and quality Three stripe never disappoints

im a huge fan of nmd so these were a huge upgrade very confortable

These shoes can be dressed up or dressed casual it is unbelievable how comfortable these shoes are Keep up the good work for the NMDline

Comfortable and light like great socks with a rubber sole that feel like your not wearing shoes at all

Bought a pair of these shoes and the left shoe had a hole after about wearing them four times the right one was untouched I returned them for a new pair customer service was great however after about another week or two my second pair had a hole in the same spot Once again the right shoe was fine

My feet are a little narrow but these shoes were super wide

Most comfortable adidas shoes ever Boost system is the big difference

No insoles come with this product My other pair of NMDhave insoles as well as a pair of UltraBoosts I own The lack of insoles make these shoes not nearly as comfortable as my other Adidas shoes

Was disappointed with the insole there is no cushion whatsoever It looks like the forgot the insole also my son has wore them a week and the sole is already starting to show wear The black piece is already pulling away from the white sole Kid likes them mom is not impressed

I thought the shoe was very comfortable and true to size Good looking shoe

VERY poor quality The primeknit literally shredded apart at toe and sole detached from toe to flap around loose

Awesome shoe will purchase more NMDs Great shoe

It looks great But shows the shape of your toes

Bought these for my teenager and he loves them He tends to be a wider foot and these are a nice fit Quick and easy to pull on Not quite as much support as the Boost but a nice style change

Great design and comfortably wearing lots of compliments I love this

I do not regreatthis purchase at all but several flaws I noticed were that the edge between the PK and boost is uneven slightly The more important thing is that if the quality seems not to match the price point This may all be in my head but the shoe does not SEEM durable I HAVE SEEN NO SIGNS OF VISIBLE WEAR overall very pleased with the purchase

Comfortable stylish and good pricing I really like shoes and will be purchasing again

its comfortable and stylish You can wear this color with most outfits

Amazing shoes hook it up with a discount so I can buy more

I was shocked that there was no insert in the shoe to cushion my feet but surprising the sole is enough cushion to have a large amount of comfort

very comfortable and the size runs just as normal

Nmds shoes are my favorite ones They are one of the most comfortable shoes Adidas has made

These shoes are super light flexible and comfortable they have surpassed my expectation would recommend them to everyone

Shoes are very comfortable and constructed very well Fits well and secure

I like the style and color it is almost perfect the only thing that I can recommmend to add a more sole cushion it will be perfect

Picked these up on clearance and pretty happy with them Read the other reviews so the pink color does not bother me

I bought these for my son This is his second pair He says they are soooo comfortable The quality has been great These have held much better longer than other shoes he has had and he has pretty rough on them

I got both camo colors for these shoes that goes well with the camo clothes from adidas

These are the slickest pair of shoes you will ever own Impossible to find it stores they constantly sell out

I love the color scheme and the comfort level of the shoes

The upper is breathable and it is a really stable shoe

Great for casual wear Feels like a slipper I wear them to the gym change to my trainers and slip them back on when I leave

I wanted a black shoes like this and price was perfect so I decided to order this ones on a size 6 man and I am size 7 5 women and fit perfectly

Perfect casual shoes to lounge run quick errands sitting long periods of time airplane travel Not recommended for long periods of walking

nmd are the perfect sneaker Boost is like clouds for your feet and I love the distinctive look of the r1 I have multiple color ways but the duck camo may be my favorite Great shoe

Stile and comfortable nothing else i love these shoes

I bought this for my husband and he likes it because it is so comfy and perfect for everyday use

I like because it is confy and the ship in was fast

Look and fit and comfortable goes with every style

I like shoes very much but the ankle of the shoes is too high to make me feel uncomfortable The color of the shoes is not so pretty

I love the style and color Comfort is good but not great I like the comfort of ultra boost better

Super comfortable and great quality I fell in love with Adidas again

I like the shoe andgood price definitely recommend

This is a really clean shoe I can wear them with joggers or jeans Comfort is Key

I purchased these for my 15 year son and he loves them He says they are very very comfortable

This shoe was a little less comfortable than I expected compared to the other Boost shoe I wore EQT

Great product I recommend this product They are amazing

It just felt too loose I ordered it in my size but my feet felt like they were swimming in a comfortable pool What I mean is that during my running or rowing at the gym the shoe felt like my heel would pop out The design of this shoe is identical to the Ultraboost knit fabric but with that shoe I did not experience this behavior That is the Ultraboost felt more snug on my feet Barring this experience I should note that this shoe is extremely comfortable and quite nice to walk in likely because of the boost sole Ultimately I returned it and would invest in something a bit more snug

Being a college student I walk a lot These shoes look great and are really comfortable I spend most of my day in the gym walking around campus and I have never had an issue with these

Colorway is dope Joker pack and the boost sole is super comfy Shoe is very light and quality is solid

Great shoe but to improve comfort a padded insert is needed

A stylish shoe that offers a lot of comfort would not run or workout in these but they could get through it Shoe was a little narrow for my wide foot but still fit

The shoes is kind of in pink

Shoes fit good nice snug fit I own various different nmd ultraboost and yeezys and after a very short amount of time they stop being as comfortable as they were Just wish they would all last longer for the price we spend on them

The look and comfort of the nmd never fail For years I swore by a competitor brand but I think I have finally made the switch the 3 stripes mainly due to the comfort and look of the NMD line

Runs a little big for a 9 1 2 I usually get that size for nmds I guess because of the material Other than that the shoe is great

Very comfortable second to first releases nmd The material on the early nmd are much thicker and softer

the shoes are definitely easy to slip on and off of the feet

This shoe is great for athletics but adds a bit of a casual twist I can wear these in public and still look decent despite the fact that they are running shoes

Perfect for my feet comfortable and very stylist

These are super comfortable and look great too

Colour it look fresher than picture so it aweaome

The NMD is one of the shoes that got adidas huge I really love the color and comfort that it gives Great casual shoe and sport shoe

I have bought nmds for last year these shoes are amazing please make more colors please best shoe so comfy

Nice design and the comfort is always as expected with boost soles

Great quality shoe unfotunately i had to send them back because my family member did not want it but great shoe

I really love it Next similar pair I will get them half size smaller for a perfect fit

The shoes are very comfortable and breathablecan wear them all day with comfort

I really wanted to like this shoe The sock like feel the light weight the color I just could not get over the heel cup digging into my right ankle

They combine boost technology and the style of the originals product line to create the ultimate shoe They are light and comfortable which makes them the perfect pair for those on the go

Bought them for my son at the San Marcos TX outlet and found out that they were missing insoles disappointing

I like it because it is comfortable and it is the perfect shoe for everything

it looks and feels good to walk it is quite durable

I love everything about these shoes Especially how comfortable hey feel Feels like your wearing a sock with a sole and only the best sole Plus they look amazing

I thought that this product was amazing Perfect and definitely worth the money

The comfort of these shoes are amazing Fit perfect

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned it is important since I am on my feet 90 of my workday I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for comfort and style in a shoe

I LOVED the shoes but they were too wide for me I had to return them due to the width but I wished I could have kept them They were so comfortable and stylish

wonderful shoe with great price Strongly recommend

This shoes can be worn on any occasion the subtle off white with pops of lime and magenta make this shoe stand out among the crowd

I ordered these shoes and it took 13 days for me to actually receive them The quality of the shoes is good but they do tend to run a bit large Overall decent experience

I like this product because of its comfort and its look

do not like that they do not come with insoles

Conmake sure to order half size up

I like this product because it is very stylish and comfortable

Gave this as a gift and they loved the item they want more

Good product super light very comfortable for walking or running

Great shoe to run in however the back of shoe rubs the back of your ankle

Most comfortable shoe in the market I will be buying more

they are a real nice color and NMD are real comfortable

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They have completely converted me over from my flyknits

My son loves the way they look and feel I love the quality and support

This is a great product Extremely comfortable durable and good looking The colors are great and work with many outfits I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested

The nmd are my son favorite shoes and he liked the looks of these new ones

I recently started buying NMDI know the stlt is not the most popular NMD but it fits my foot perfectly and it is easy to throw on and it is a very good looking shoe that is comfortable

I lot love the color their so comfy and the size was perfect

Love the black pink combo and the knit upper is comfy and keeps my foot in

They are light weight and have a super comfortable fit

Perfect fit and very comfortable Very stylish

Love them it is like walking around in your favourite pair of slippers

This shoe is great You will not regret wearing it as its comfortable and looks awesome

I took these to my trip to Japan and it was the best idea I had besides just deciding to go to Japan The culture will some times require you to remove shoes in quite a few places so beinable to slip a comfortable shoe on and off was brilliant Then add on airport security and all the walking I did in perfect comfortable It literally was the perfect shoe for my trip And of course once I got back they are still ultra comfortable and convenient to take on and off A super not picky thing I would say if there was a draw back is they lack a bit of support going down steep slopes But having to go down a slope will probably not happen to you very often so super small detail

comfort and design ahead of it is time Only wish the mid sole was easy to clean

Nice for long flights or drives The knit is snug enough to stay on but easy to kick off without untying Ultraboost soles are comfortable for long walks but too soft for lifting weights military press squats or deadlifts Fine for running but would not be my go to Otherwise an excellent shoe to knock around in

A fashionable kicks for casual and comfort activities

The shoe looked wonderful but the back tag was absolutely horrible and rubbed into my ankle making it bleed I can not recommend this shoe solely because the tag at the back

Lightweight comfortable sole true to other NMD R1 versions that I own As others may have mentioned Adidas description of the color of this shoe is not quite accurate Oreo toebox with peach primeknit accents is how I would describe it Picture is pretty true to the shoe if you use the zoom feature

I know a guy that bought this shoe with his first paycheck

A very comfortable item with amazing quality It looks very nice aswell

I wear these basically every day and they are extremely comfortable The laces are mostly for show and you can see some adhesive around the accents But I really like the look otherwise I can not wait until they are all grimy from wear Nothing beats a dirty white sneaker

These shoes are so comfortable would recommend ordering a half size smaller than your normal shoe size in the prime knit

Very comfortable and fits like a sock Runs small so go down half a size if not full from what you wear in ultraboost

Very comfortable and fits like a sock Runs small so I would go down a half size if not full from ultra boost

Super easy to wear You also can not go wrong with a triple black shoe

The shoe is one of the best I have purchased yet it would of been nice if the stickers stayed on the product

The color combination on this shoe is nice The shoe itself is way to wide in the toe box and looks clunky Overall it is a fairly ugly shoe

Is not sore to wear on my feet and really comfortable

Fits a bit larger than your original size The plastic piece that holds the laces get annoying sometimes as they would pop out of shape

They are my favorite pair of shoes Thank you so much

At first they were super nice and comfortable and I loved them but the sole had soon ripped from the primeknit and had to super glue it back but other than that they are super comfortable and nice

The shoes are very comfortable but the shoe quality is very bad because they ripped apart after 1 week of using them and seem to not be well made

Feels like many other NMD which is a good thing and fit1 2 size smaller The knit pattern grew on me more in person Comfortable like most other primeknit NMDs Highly recommend

Exactly what I expected comfortable easy to use every day

Perfect exactly what you would expect from a primeknit nmd Love the black on black as well

Perfect very beautiful and very comfortable and it comes in a good price a little spicy but good

Perfectly comfortable I would definitely recommend this

Shoes were very comfortable but some how primeknit got holes with 3 months of shoes this time i am going to buy NMD without primeknit upper

Great product I would recommend it to others I really enjoy the flyknit and the comfort of the sole

It is pretty but after order and wear it does not like we want it is not comfortable

Good purchase Fast shipping Comfy shoes Good price

Hooah wearing these at AIT army training

This shoe is very lightweight and super comfortable It feels like walking on clouds

I like this product but I was not expecting it to come in these more noticeable pink primknit It did not look exactly like the photo on the website

The shoe okay Almost as comfortable as an ultraboost But the picture was a little bit misleading compared to when you actually get it I did not expect to have so many pink in it compared to the picture online



it is super comfortable and really cool shoe feels like walking on air

love these shoes they are just beyond comfortable and so light love the color too I am a girl and got the men shoes cause i just love the tan color

The material got stretched out and got hole in them after 1 week of use

Bought these for my son and my husband ended up getting a pair because of the comfort and look

can not beat what Adidas is doing with the boost Mixing style comfort

Ordered a half size down from true to size and it fit perfectly Most comfortable shoe I have owned in a while

it is a stylish and comfortable shoe Super affordable and I would highly recommend buying this product

I love these shoes because of the boost material which makes them comfortable they are also very stylish and the stripes are reflective

These are the best shoes I wish I had a 13 5 but the 14 is working just fine

I honestly really enjoyed these and they will get you a couple of compliments and supper comfy recommend get like 1 2 a size bigger tho

I love the way these slip on and feel Great for running

Shoe seems to run slightly smaller and snug which is probably due to the material it is made of but overall is a great shoe Style and colors is a

Comfortable shoe I love it and price was right if you have chance buy them

I like it I am glad i decided to purchase Will i get other colors No I do love the shoe tho

Great colors stylish Goes with almost anything Definitely worth it

These really are like putting on socks My only complaint is when wearing with low cut socks the back rubs against my Achilles and irritates my skin

The shoes look good and they are nice to walk in They get the attention of others by being so bright red They also are really easy to slip on which is nice and quick 10 10 would recommend

I like it because they are just perfect and a good style

The shoes have a very nice neutral color way can go with a lot of colors and great for the gym

Like all nmd these shoes are extremely comfortable and lightweight Great design and this colorway really pops Love the neon green Adidas print on each shoe Stylish and comfortable

Great style comfortable shoe and even better price

Good price for such great style and quality Love the NMD brand

Right shoe for everyday use in summer Not for sports

They are durable and well made will be getting more pairs

Maybe should have gone down half a size my heel kinda lifts up and down when walking which hurts my heel after a couple hours Might try to go down half a size for the next pair of would prime knit

Very good gym sneakers More of a flat bottom for lifting

Love adidas originals shoes Best trainers on the market hands down The style and comfort are unmatched

Because adidas is the best ana that is ALL I wear

My go to sneakers bought 3 pair 2 colors

Looks great feels awesome really adds energy to my night walks The only negative is that they run a bit small so order up

I was sad to see a hole in my shoes from the first day of wearing them These shoes one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet and I will say that the quality of the shoe allow forward to unravel at the toe

These shoes feel like they are already worn out The cushioning feels nonexistent Otherwise they are great looking and fit good

Adidas does it again with the NMD R1 The first thing I noticed was how snug the shoe fit after I put it on and secondly how comfortable they were after walking around a bit Super stylish shoes with extremely pleasant to wear

I just love the quality that adidas brings into the market

I wore them for about 30 mins and already felt the tag scuffing the back of my ankle I am pretty sure if I wore them any longer they would make me bleed Soles are not very supportive either

These are cute shoes Love the black camo print and they are true to size in my opinion I wear a women 8 and purchased a men 6 I have not worn them for a long period of time yet but they are comfy for short periods

Cool urban shoes and in style i had to get a pair

Love the comfort and style ability of these sneakers Like walking on clouds

Great shoee and love the look of it Fast shipping

There are sooooooo comfortableeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Great fit and quality design it is my 17th pair of adidas nmds

I liked the color way And for the price we got them for you could not pass them up

I ignored those saying that these run large and ordered my true size I have a slightly wider than normal foot and they fit perfectly The Primeknit is incredibly light weight and breathes well I love that they slip on like socks and the Boost midsole is unbeatable I ordered the Black Gray Gray colorway and did not realize that they have a bit of a pinkish color in the weave as well I like the actual coloring much better than the online pictures

it is a great silhouette so I have no problem buying more than one pair As long as the colorways are not wack

The red is bright and contrasts with the blue Amazing sneakers for dope outfits

I like the style of the shoe I just wish that the shoe was a lil wider other than that it is a good casual shoe

perfect for casual wear and for the runners out there

This shoe is perfect for those who are on their feet a lot at work

Comfortable not too much boost on it so it does not hurt my feet love the style and the look can wear with shorts or jeans

PK is really high quality and stretchy I really like the fit and the STLT knit patters is legit

if you wanna run these are the shoes for you I use them daily

Shoe arrived in perfect condition and looked awesome I would describe the feel of the shoe as sock like which made it very comfortable The shoe does lack support for horizontal movement so be mindful of that

This is such a great shoe Amazing comfort Wearability to go with jeans or with athletic gear Versatile shoe

Great shoe slightly snug at the heel but comfortable

Bought them for my son and he absolutely loves them

The shoes are very nice Unfortunately the shoe makes your feet smell I have never had a problem with my shoes giving bad odor I would usually wear Jordan and the NMD are very comfortable but they keep giving a very unpleasant smell

I am a big fan of the Ultraboosts and NMD Pros of the UB are that they have more cushioning and more support Pros of the NMS are that they feel more like you are not wearing any shoes but less support

It is confortable I like the color and the texture of the product

Great build quality and perfect fit also the most comfortable shoes ever

I loved them so much I bought 2 more pairs online for friends

cant go wrong with an all white shoe and this shoe fits all the criteria

The THREE STRIPE LIFE is taking me over the boost technology is amazingly comfortable my go to kicks

Love the white on white NMDs run a little wide so that is to be expected but they are a must for the white shoe lover

Unfortunately these are very noticeably pink rather than gray Will be returning since they were for my son

Fits perfect and comfortable Also perfect for running

I have been looking at NMD R1s for months but finally pulled the trigger on these They are very comfortable and springy

Its camo heel looks nice I love the quality its perfect

Great look Fits true to size Not as comfortable as other boost models but comfy nonetheless

These shoes state they are mens but they are womens size They run small I always wear 9 in mens and 10 in womens These shoes were way to small Also look at the picture closely On the inside of the shoes it has a HUGE ugly Adidas logo on them When I ordered them online I could not see that in the picture They would be nice looking shoes without that logo

Stylish Comfort and Priced Right NMDs are awesome

I normally wear a 10 5 but the pair that fit me well is a 9 Overall its still a highly recommended shoe Its a Boost so you cant go wrong

they are alright but I was told from friends and persuaded into thinking that they were supper comfy and stuff for running but they really are not However they are the only pair of shoes that fit the width of my foot while running so while running on inclines I get a lot more traction Also while on that topic they are the best at getting traction to the road or sidewalk that I have had so far If they would not give me blisters these would me my favorite shoes

I love wear them especially since it my favorite color and I can almost wear them with anything

Great solid looking sneaker Really comfortable and very satisfied with my purchase Might purchase a 2nd pair just to have and hold until needed

These sneaker are comfortable and lightweight It almost feels like you have nothing on your feet

So wide that it is ludicrous no onefoot can have such proportions Also surprisingly cheap looking for Adidas

Love these nmdThe camo pattern looks great Super comfortable walking around in them

Is comfortable and I like adidas products and clothing too

Very comfortable shoe and I got it for a great price

Nice comfortable shoe to run errands in Stringly recommend

Comfortable and awesome look Will purchase again

Only thing I can say is just get a size or size in a half bigger

they are so so comfortable its insane i wear them at work walking inside and outside the building such a great purchase im going to buy another pair i want them to last for ever

I love how nmd are literally good for everything

I love how the nmd are good for literally everything

I bought these for my boyfriend birthday and he absolutely fell in love with them These NMD R1 shoes are his favorite style and they compliment him completely Tons of people have complimented him everywhere he goes Money well spent to see him happy and stylin

No I would not recommend this sneaker because the sneaker looks cheap It looks like it was fake and someone had put it together with a bunch of glue

Only complaint is that they do not have any insole and I think it makes the shoes less comfortable

The NMD R1are the best pair of shoes I own so far The shoes are super comfortable I like how these are slip ones the laces are more for cosmetics Very good design and quality

Product is great and comfortable However you might want to get about half a size lower

The camo color is very nice and similar to the Bape NMD The 3m stripes are very clean as well

it is stylish and comfortable I can wear them with anything

I love it My first NMD I got a size 6 in men 7 1 2 in Women Really comfy really stylish really cute

Description on the website was incorrect colors did not match at all

does not hurt my feet even after a long day Love the color combinations

I like it because it is stylish and really comfortable Helps a lot when I walk a lot

Fits like a sock very stylish comfortable and a must buy Feels like a cloud on a bouncy boost underlining Very nice shoe

These shoes are perfect for any type of activity I use these shoes on a daily basis 10 10

Got these for my son He loves them Fit is great looks great and he raves about how comfortable they are Definitely recommend

Would not recommend you use this for running or anything physically intensive However for normal walking on flat surfaces they work perfectly The primeknit makes them so light and breathable that it will feel like you are wearing socks with a sole This may either be a good or bad thing based on how you look at it If you are looking for your feet to feel secure and protected this may not be the shoe for you However if you are looking for a shoe to be very light breathable and comfortable and do not care about your feet feeling protected then this will work for you So in conclusion these are only good for a casual amount of walking on flat street surfaces and can feel limited in terms of use cases

Love it but I had blister on the back wish they can do something about this style

Comfortable stylish and perfect worth a purchase

I like this product is well designed good material nice colors is unique shoes

Feels great looks great I really recommend these shoes go with a lot of things

I like these shoes because they stand out I got them for the red and black color did not notice the blue stitching they come with in the picture but very noticeable in person which is the only dislike I have with the shoes

Confortable and money is worth it I recommend them

Sock like fit feels amazing on your feet and boost is very comfortable

They are comfortable and they were delivered on time

Love the style and color the camo is a great color

The shoe looks great and has great quality but it runs half a size too small I would recommend getting it a half size larger than your usual

Too big Need to return Sick of adidas sneakers being one size in one product and another in another shoe

ONE THING I NOTICED IS THAT THE GLUE WAS A BIT VISIBLE ON THIS COLOR BLACK BUT THE ALL BLACK IS THE COOLEST PART ABOUT IT LOVE THE RED ACCENT

They look pretty cool they are comfortable and they work with different outfits

very comfortable and the price is worthy highly recommended

This shoe is too narrow and long If you have a wide feet go up half a size but be warn there will be a lot of toe space due to the fact that these are long and pointy shoes

The show fits nice no doubt about that the side of the shoe looks incredible but when you look down they look like your feet are huge and fat do not know how else to discribe it

my 3rd pair of NMD R1 I absolutly love this shoe

Run slightly above size Adidas needs more half sizes Beautiful sneaker

This shoe is great it is comfortable like my other adidas However this was the first pair I ordered from the online store I ordered two pairs and both came with big creases in the toe cap It does not affect the comfort of the shoe and it is much less noticeable when the shoe is on I am just slightly disappointed that both shoes looked like this out of the box Great shoes I will just be hesitant to purchase from the online store again

First nmds I have ever purchased and I am in love with them

Love the primeknits super comfortable high quality

High quality NMDa little narrow for my taste But not everyone has wider feet like me

These are ideal workout shoes They are light and breathableprimeknitand extremely comfortable The color combo and design is also sleek Some primeknit shoes run a tad small but these are true top size

The it pattern is awesome and the comfort is comparable to all the other nmd 

The color looks cool and the shoes are very light

The primeknit material makes this shoe so great It wraps perfectly around your foot and weighs literally nothing

I get a lot of compliments about my shoes They are a perfect color match

Good comfy kicks for the price Will be buying more soon

This is the best shoe ever because it is so comfortable and you can weare it with enithing

i Like the fact that is feels as if you would be walking on a pillow all day

Great Lightweight Shoes They have the awesome support sole of NMD and the primeknit material breathes really well They do run a bit larger so I would suggest getting 1 2 size smaller than what you normally wear

Very light weight And as with any prime knit nmd the comfort is unmatched thanks adidas

Extremely comfortable shoe Prone to water damage

These are comfortable and fit nicely and I would like to give these a higher rating but the advertising on the color style is very misleading The description of the shoes I purchased is core black grey grey and the images online seem to show that However the shoes that I received are basically orange Upon very close inspection of the photos online I can see the orange woven into the fabric now but there is no way anyone could see that without zooming all the way in The fact that description claims it is black and grey is also very misleading I am pretty annoyed because I usually do not wear anything with colors and now I have a pair of shoes that is obviously orange

very bad quality shoes I noticed that some others had the same experience as I did The glue on the side of the shoe is very visible I also started having knee pain after walking a long distance with these shoes Overall I would give it a one star

this is a very comfortable shoe and I have so many of them

Primeknit is the most comfortable part was scared they would be loose but they are perfect

I love these shoes for the logo inside and the decorative color choice

I had to order a half size larger due to narrow toe box but overall the comfort was good However the quality is lacking there is shoe glue all over the shoe which of course takes away from the aesthetics I think I will be returning these

Very comfortable and love the color Easy to keep clean

Awesome shoe So comfortable light I love it second pair

Great slip on shoe great color A little big but not bad

Love the look love the feel light and comfy not for sports IMHO as no support but perfect for casual daily wear

The price point is what initially had me purchase the shoes once I tried them they were much nicer than anticipated

Looks great and feel great on feet Would recommend because they bringing the heat with this BRED color way

Great product I recommend 100 percent Their also very affordable

it is light weight but comfortable Great price Great for walking

I did not like this pair that I bought was a bit disappointed beacause yhe last one I bought did not look like it was falling apart this shoe looks like it was glued on they where made poorly for the cost it was not worth it word of advice do not buy this style or this one

Look cool and very comfortable If deciding between these and another pair you can not go wrong with these

Love the NMD styles

Great shoe but the back tag rubs the ankle too much

design is nice but the fit was too big and I could not change because it was sold out

Been wearing pureboost and ultraboost the NMD does not feel good probably will not buy another pair of nmd

Perfect style Red accent goes well with the black

The shoes are very comfortable I like the colors

I am a big guy and everything fits Perfect so far Very satisfied

I personally do not like NMDs but i love these models they are awesome looking and comfortable but if you do not wear socks or no show socks the back of your feet hurts

I love it but Adidas needs to widen the shoes The sole is so narrow that my foot is not supported well There could be wider options

The shoe is very comfortable and i did not take long to receive them

Nice comfortable shoes but came with a defect with a small puncture at the tongue area so probably will return it

I love these because they resemble something ill probably never get The bape nmds Thank you adidas for the hook up and thank you sneakersteals on IG for putting us on the best deals for sneakers

8th pair of nmd They never disappoint you should definitely cop

super comfortable feels like I am not wearing a shoe

Great shoe

I liked everything about this shoe except for the black pieces of rubber on the sides of the shoe After wearing the shoes around the house for just a minute or so I could feel the black piece of rubber on the outside of the shoe digging into the inside of my heel I am not sure how more people have not experienced this and I guess there have not been enough complaints to get rid of these pieces of rubber I feel like I have a pretty normal walk my other shoes have always worn pretty evenly I would like these shoes if they did not have this piece of rubber

I like NMD R1 STLT because they fit comfortably on my feet and they were on sale

overall nice shoe great price very comfortable nice colors

The shoes have holes with a few wearings My son loves them and wore them as normal wear a few times and already has 4 holes

it is an amazing shoe Comfortable too Would recommend

Some areas show a bit of glue but it does not over power the stylish look In my opinion its a cool colorway and very comfortable i hope i was helpful friends check out my photographs for a better detail image of the nmd r1 core black lush red

This shoe is perfect This shoe is perfect This shoe is perfect This shoe is perfect This shoe is perfect

it is adidas What not to likeFits perfectly and will buy the black one for a good deal

Got them as a birthday gift for a friend he really liked them and enjoyed them more than EQT 93 17 Offers more stability and nmds still have a little hype in them

the glue on the sides other than that they were good

Great quality shoes I will purchase more shoes from adidas

I love NMDs and this shoe really caught my eye After looking a little close the glue was on the primeknite around the toe box The bricks on the shoe get creases and it is annoying that every time that happens I have to fix it Other then that these shoes are great

I like them would prefer a leather uppperThe upper is not strong enough

these have like the same camo print as the bapes nice alternative

whoa loving the color scheme on these if they were more limited they would flip

Perfect fit and comfort I am on my feet all day and these support my feet really well

They look really nice on feet Really comfortable pair of shoes

Loved it Worth buying I would recommend these sneakers

Great shoes and great experience with Adidas Will do business again

Great brand of shoe and great colors in this type of shoe

The color way of the sneakers and how comfortable they are

Favorite NMD pair yet Visually great and comfortable like always

Great fit extremely comfortable I would buy another pair just to have that is how good the shoe is

The shoe is really comfortable I have a wide foot and it was still good The red gives it a good color pop

nmd are perfect Size is perfect along with overall comfort and style

Great looking shoe and very comfortable Nmd are a great buy

I like these new NMDthey are super comfy and the colorway is awesome

Nice looks but it ends there Returned the shoes immediately because1 No arch support come on Adidas why leave out arch support2 very loose fit but smaller size would not be long enough 3 prominent orange thread even though description says gray black and white Feels like a cheaply made shoe

Is the best quality in the market and I like the style I used for more than 40 year

The shoes really standout for the way they look and they feel very comfortable I am a PE teacher so I am walking around all day long and they hold up well after a long day

Cheap quality Can see glue sticking out and parts are not sticking togethere

Great shoe for a great value Would highly recommend

Very comfortable pair of shoes Perfect size They are a big snug trying to get them on but once your able to past that part they are great

Love it Stylish and snug fit And apparently these reviews have to be so long so heresome extra text

Unique look Perfect colors and the same good quality

Was wondering how this shoe would fit compared the the regular NMD series shoes but I was not disappointed The sole might bother your heal but that depends on the kind of sock you wear

Shoes look okay but they actually look different like in the pictures

NMDs are the most comfortable shoes ever and they are cute

My husband loves them He thinks they are very nice and comfortable shoes

These happen to be my first pair of NMD and I am hooked

it is the perfect shoe to be proud to buy and have everyone see

Comfy fits true size They go with pretty much anything you wear

I like the product because the color is beautiful and how the shoe looks in general

Fit and comfortable Great for long hours at work My patients and other staff love it too for its design and style

comfortable shoes This is a smooth looking and feel good shoe i like the color

Clean design and fits true to size This color way is very balanced

I Thought these shoes was not gonna be the feather shoes as promised BUT Now that I have them I feel like I have nothing on

They look awesome Very comfortable There is a little bit of noticeable glue on the shoes that I do not like Other than that they are perfect

Looks unique and stylish the sizes fit pretty good

Finally got a pair of nmd with black sole extremely comfortable fit true to size thank you

True to size fits great and looks great whenever you are wearing as casual or work out sneakers

comfy but runs big i prefer the ultraboost over the nmds

Love the update to this model as it started to lose some steam

The most amazing shoes I have ever owned I love Adidas and the care they put into their products

Confort and perfect fit for that price it is awesome

Shoes are comfortable and look great however the quality is poor I was excited to receive these shoes but there are obvious signs of yellow glue surrounding the shoe where the fabric is stitched See photos attached

This shoe launched and I got it same day When I got the shoe The shoe had glue a different color that showed through The box was beat up and it looked like they had been tried on Was disappointed because it was a gift and it was not to expectations Specially after waiting till 3am to get it

I

Fits perfect and they do not weight a thing

it is the best adidas shoes I have ever buy when I walk I feel like walking on a cloud

Great colorway Still dislike the burrito tongue but fantastic overall

It says core black gray but why is it so pinkI also do not get why the color change just cuts on top

They are very comfortable and look good on foot They are very good for running

The shoe is so light comfy and keeps cool air circulating It goes with all my outfits and I get a lot of compliments I would take the fake laces out tho since you can not really tie them

comfortable and good looking 10 10 would wear again

I knew when I ordered these awesome shoes that I would have to go half a size smaller 9 to 8 5 and it fits perfectly Very satisfied

I absolutely adore these shoes They provide excellent support for my full 12hour work day and the prime knit top does not get stuffy or tight The only downfall I realized is my fat self has already creased the support block near the outer front of the shoe Everything else is a solid 10 10

The fabric of BOTH shoes separated at toe after only a few wears So disappointing because my 12 year old spent his own money to buy this shoe I have 6 kids and usually spend less on sneakers He really wanted this one so we split the cost He only used them to wear at school and after wearing them about 6 7 times the fabric separated from the tops of the shoe The shoe was well fitted and it is ridiculous that it did not even last more than a week Makes me never want to buy Adidas again which is a shame since we usually choose Adidas for his soccer cleats could not be more disappointed especially for him

These shoes are great We have other pairs Very comfortable and easy for my son to slip on But the description needs to be updated The shoes are listed as black and gray which is why we ordered them We needed a neutral color to match his nicer outfits since we already have some other crazy colors But when we received them they were pink So we had to return them The color is the only reason I downgraded from 5 to 4 stars

I really enjoy this style of NMD a lot This is my fourth pair of STLT I will keep buying this style if my color styles come out The prime knot feels really good and makes the shoe so much easier to put on I highly recommend buying these shoes

The shoes are very confortable they look modern but classic at the same time Incredible design

They are super comfortable for running and walking Get a half size up for comfortable running

I like nmd cuz it is comfortable and build with great quality but idk maybe not anymore

Color scheme comfort and style Only real concern is however the sole and v and were glued did not work out See attached images

I already have 6 pair of r1 and 1 pair of r2 but this shoes are the best one I buy it

Just had this delivered to me and I wore them and got many compliments Not only is it stylish but pretty comfortable

They are great shoes they are very comfy and look good too

Shoes are great although they look as if they were made poorly or melted during the shipping process At first it looked like they were used with dirt on them

Extremely comfortable and stylish I do not how easy they get dirty but love the product

I wear these a lot and although I often feel like a frat boy in them boy are they comfortable

its very easy to slip on when your running out of the house its also very light and breathable making all day use very comfortable

Extremely comfortable shoe and this is the best color way so far in my opinion Black and red is a classic colorway and its nice to see it on the NMD

Great price and comfort Great for running or every day wearing

Iconic NMD with a PK upper Size half down from your usual size and you will not be disappointed

Very comfortable and great colour combo Good quality

when i got these i thought there was too mush hype but know i realize they are great shoes

The asthetic is perfect The back straps add character

This shoe is by far the most comfortable shoe I own and it looks very clean

These shoes or very light and edgy but also have a classy look to be the perfect shoe for a semi classy dinner

If you do not own a pair you should get one too NMDgot you covered

Super comfortable and they are super light weight

Love this shoe Very comfortable I like the colorway Only issue is if you have a slimmer foot like me you will not be able to run too comfortablely but I assume you can just insert a sole in there for more fitted feel if you just want to use these as casual and walking shoes they will be more than good I have two pairs and regret nothing For running I bought the ultraboost but these are more comfortable for everyday use

I loved the shoe it was the wrong size The size I exchanged them for fit perfect Jammy at the outlet was very helpful

fits and wears well didnt love the color would order again

I would not wear these for actually working out because they would wear too easily and do not have as tight a fit as I like but great for just walking around in

I really like the design of this shoe in parallel with the actual comfort of sole However the shoe is WAY too big considering you are not able to tightly tie it due to design The tab at back of shoe is kind of long and irritates my heel I wish I did not wait 5 weeks before opening the box and trying on because I definitely would have either exchanged sizes or returned for a refund if at all possible

Light Comfortable excellent fit I can wear this everyday

The boost midsole is slightly canceled out by the nmd plugs on the side but it is still very comfortable and the primknit upper is very breathable

Would definitely recommend and will be buying another pair

Bought for my 14 son and the first day he wore them his toe went right through the top of the shoe He was walking on a sidewalk and tripped Not even running Lucky he did not break a toe

Looks great and the shoes are very comfortable I can totally wear these all day and barely even notice they are on

These shoes provide really good support because of the cushioned boost No problem standing in them all day I would recommend

I like this product because its comfy and affordable

Probably the second most comfortable shoe I have ever tried on

My son picked these out and as soon as he put them on his feet he would not take them off

Amazing Worth every penny very comfortable to wear

I like it because they do not feel like I am wearing shoes at all

They hold up to any stylewhether its at the gym or on the street they look dope

These are so awesome The 3m really hits hard

These fit perfect and so comfy Adidas kills it with the boost

Very stylish and comfortable Not just a running shoe but a street wear shoe to remain stylish and comfortable at the same time I would purchase them again

A sleek look and a comfortable fitthese fit slightly larger than the flyknit pair I have I am a size 11 in the flyknit and these were just slightly larger but still wearable

I like it

I am a big fan of nmd they have the best quality and can not complain for the price I paid always been a adidas customers and will always be

Have several pair of ultra boosts The prime knits have gotten a lot of compliments Great shoe

Too big for me Wish I knew they ran bigger so I would get a smaller size

Great shoes so comfy I have three pairs Adidas is awesome

These shoes have the comfort and style of other nmd I have owned but by far the coolest color

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

I really like them I wish the dark blue were available

The shoes fit perfectly and the are very comfortable

If you do not want to spend too much on ultraboost these NMDs are definitely a good alternative do not get me wrong they are not as comfortable as the UBbut they are fairly close

Its so comfortable and it feels like you are wearing socks it is perfect

Really Comfy and nice to where Get compliments all the time Goes great with joggers

Perfect fit and feels confortable and good quality matieral

Super comfy to walk The show molds perfect to ones foot and looks good with jeans or shorts

So nice so flex I love the shoes so much they are1

Stylish and compatible with multiple outfits Feels great on foot

Very satisfied with this purchase very stylish and comfortable

I get all kinds of compliments on these sneakers Love them

Was looking for a comfortable and light weight shoes would highly recommend for everyone to wear

Great shoe super comfortable snd light Match pretty much everything

These shoes are great because they are super comfortable and they go with anything Jeans khakis sweatpants shorts etc All things that look great with the shoes This is my first Adidas NMD purchase and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future

My Grandson loves them said they are so comfortable

Good reasonably priced product Really comfortable

Bought these shoes for back to school for my son They fit great and he loves the quality of the shoe

best quality and best comfort ever i will recommend this shoes to every friend i have

I really liked these shoes Got them about two weeks ago and they are the most comfortable shoes i have ever owned and they go with everything Favorite shoes so far

Great overall shoe best pair of NMDs I have ever bought and I have had several

it is a nice shoe that is comfortable once you get used to the holes is the soles In certain areas there are larger then usual gaps on one shoe then on the other one and you can see the glue as well

I like the way the shoe looks and fits but the sole of the shoe is very uncomfortable I needed to by insertable soles

My grandson chose them and loves them He was impressed with how comfortable they were as well as the price

Fit perfect look great very comfortable fast shipping

They were exactly what my son expected I love that you put his favorite shoes on sale

Good quality Perfect size shoe got 9 5 and I was not disappointed

The boost feels great as normal and the mesh is breathable

Great shoe Super comfortable and stylish I would recommend it to anyone

LOVE So comfy and versatile I can use them at the gym or casually

Great item for a great price Nice color A very comfortable shoe

They are very comfortable but the inside tares kinda easily

Product did not have an insole which made in uncomfortable The feet begins to hurt after 5 min walk

Excellent shoes Great quality and the price was excellent too

These shoes are super comfortable Light weight and comfortable I like in South Texas so the breathable material is important

They were really comfortable but a bit tight Quality was great

The shoes are comfortable and the gray color is great

These are probably the best shoes that i have purchased

They rip to easy But are comfortable Mine were brand new and they ripped without me doing anything to them just running

runs 1 2 size small If you normally buy 9 5 you should buy a 10

When you first put them on they are wonderful After a few hours of standing or walking my feet begin to hurt Maybe I will try some different insoles However people all ask what kind of shoes are they and compliment me on them

Its not as good for the price you can buy the same quality for less money

it is stylish and comfortable all in one Looking forward to the next pair

Great product as always Order arrived prior to date as expected and shoes fit true to size and very comfortable

This shoe is one of the best looking shoe I have gotten but true size was just too wide and length was slightly longer

Camo colors were on point comforts there with nmds and the size is true to size

Comfortable and affordable awesome looking sneakss

did not like the new upper material these shoes were made with I wish they use the same material as the previous NMDs the new material made the shoes a little extra wide

they are perfect I really like the primeknit fabrics

i like the NMD R1 so light shoes to walk and the design

Great comfortable stylish sneaker Could wear these all day

Another comfy and stylish kicks for NMDer Will surely cause rubber necking Caution

Love the Camo print and how comfortable they shoes are

Is confortable and good on foot cheaper good product

I like them because they are comfortable and go with a lot of stuff

They are comfortable but lack hard structure and the hexagons in the shoe will mess with your heel for a little while

It made my son happy so I am happy I would purchase him another pair of Adidas shoes if he would like them because that is all I wear

Comfortable and stylish for the summer great purchase

The so called yellow is actually green do not be fooled Also nmdin general are not the most comfortable

Good quality shoe that looks good and feels very comfortable

They are really comfortable and they look great with any outfit

I love the look with the comfort of this pair of shoes

I love all of the NMDs They are so comfortable and I can always order the same size and they always fit perfectly Once you find your size they are consistent and good to go

The shoes are a great fit NMD R1 shoes are my favorite style

Shoes are very comfortable and stylish Not only for physical activities but to wear out as well Great purchase

Love it because it is comfortable I will buy for my whole family it is cute shoes Love them

Came a day early and was a good pair of shoes I could not have asked for anything more

Awesome quality of shoe Order came in quick My son loves them

Wore them for one day and the black is already peeling They are comfortable and fit well but the paint on the sole is terrible

I love these sneakers boost is the best thing ever

The shoe has no cushioning it is your heel and then that plastic rubbery thing that protects it from the ground

If you are looking for a comfortable shoe you can walk around everywhere in this is the shoe for you All my Adidas shoes are extremely comfortable Definitely recommended

Every nmd shoe i have bought has been the most comfortable shoes ever

Great choice and perfect for any occasion Hopefully to buy same style but in different colors

comfort quality awesomesause kcisCHiSJdsdhsjdhd

Comfortable and nice looking products this my second pair

Stains are very hard to get out and unless you plan on walking on clouds do not suggest

Great fit and comfort Fast delivery Very happy and satisfied with my purchase

gift for my boyfriend free shipping and I got it in two days he loved them

I absolutely love the NMD adidas shoe They are not only one of the best looking pair of shoes out there but they are extremely comfortable

My big toes started to hurt after a few hours I followed the measurement for proper size and still found them a bit uncomfortable The are well made and look great however

I love the fit of the shoes Very comfortable when walking and running Only downside is you have to put them on with a bit of force due to the tight fit

Nice looking shoe very comfortable and the mesh on top makes it very breathable

Bought them thinking I could do physical exercise but it is more of a comfort everyday walking shoe Other than that I absolutely love them and wear them every single day The boost is utterly beautiful and the ease from heel to toe is great Thank you for being beautiful Adidas

it is soft and very easy to put on Also looks cool

Super light feeling and very comfortable Just not for long hours of wearing and not good whatsoever for athletic activities or heavy lifting

good price so i bought it cause it was 85 dollars

Super comfortable Outlet discount plus Miltary appreciation discount were definitely a plus

Quality was kinda lacking glue stains and overtime the boost scrapes and shows white boost

These things are ultra light and very comfortable At one point I was looking for my shoes but if I had looked down I would have seen them on my feet already I wasted 24 minutes of my life searching for what was never lost Thanks Adidas

I bought these for my active 16 year old on April 19th He picked them out and loved the comfort and style of the shoe However in early June the outersole of the right shoe cracked open and we have had to superglue it shut multiple times Granted he may have been doing too much for this shoe but I would think they would last longer than 2 months

The online purchase was simple convenient and a smooth transaction Fit comfort and fit were perfect plus it is a good looking shoe

Great product super cool and comfortable but I would prefer ultraboosts

Simply put we all know what NMDs are how much hyped or not and whether we plan on getting a pair or more I love the color style and the price was the deciding factor I cop and rock what I like and I snatched these up Of course I like them that is why I got them Good Stuff Three Stripes

They are great they mold to your feet like socks forget about blisters or any kind of discomfort

I highly recommend Very comfortable show for daily use or going to the gym

Shoes are tire to size Very comfortable The heel insert helps with shock support

yes because its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool

Within a month the sole was ripping off I have only used it for walks This is not the quality I was expecting

of PINK Seems like that would be an important detail to mention Also runs about a half size big

My wife and I each bought a pair of the NMDs while in Las Vegas Mine are cloud white and hers are baby pink We have already walked 30 kms up and down the strip in two days with the shoes and our feet feel great If you walk anywhere get these and your feet will thank you

I have been looking for this shoe in my size for months and finally found it I love them They are comfortable stylish and durable I have a white pair also My only wish is that it included cleaning instructions Especially for the white rubber bottom Overall great shoe and purchase

NMds are always my go to shoe it is like walking on clouds Amazing product

A tad big but overall comfortable shoes Shipping was very prompt

so practical you can wear with anything I love it

These shoes look really good and are supremely comfy Not often a combination you will find

Great look and extremely comfortable Definitely recommend

There was a weird bump by my toes that made the shoe very uncomfortable for me have not found this in other Adidas shoes so hoping it was just weirdly fitted on my foot

Bought for my husband according to him it is very lightweight and very comfortable to wear

I have not owned a pair of Adidas since 2008 because all the pairs I have ever bought have been too narrow for my wide foot these NMDs have changed my perspective of Adidas I swear I can not wait to buy another pair and another and another These are truly amazing Sorry it took me a decade to try you guys out again I am happy with my purchase Best Buy of 2018

Stylish but comfortable Took too long to receive tho

Shoes run like a size or a size and a half too large Consider ordering a size or size and a half down Prime knit is wrinkled when you tie laces too

comfortable shoes with sock fit just the right size lightweight

I really like this shoes it is very comfortable and nice

Regards Louismoon

I love it Super comfortable Awesome in shorts and pants

Great sneaker glad I decided to purchase and would definitely buy a few more pairs in different colors

Great shoes Super comfortable and stylish I would definitely be in the market for another pair

they are super comfy and very nice to wear I love them

These shoes are amazingly comfortable I recommend sizing down a half or full size Only complaint is how the Achilles back of the heel gets scratched by the shoes when wearing no show socks Otherwise great shoe

Shoes look great and are so light and comfortable

Only thing is I would like more Boost but i know I can just wear ultra boosts or yeezys

I am disappointed The sizing is bigger than expected

nmd is very light and comfortable for me and new design bottom of shoes

The heel on this shoe was super stiff Almost like a piece of wood was back there But maybe it was just me I returned these shoes

You got it right adidas

I actually like these more than ultraboost Just because these areva bit more street wearable

These were my first ever pair of prime knits I put them on to see if they fit and I could not feel them lol So light they were essentially nonexistent that is a good thing The shoes were made from clouds and have the durability of silicon

The slime green pops and gives such a dope accent to the shoe Im host people slept on this lol Solo swag boom

They look good but they are not true to size You would think the knitting would be tight and form fitting to your foot but feels like youre efwearing bags on my feet

I love the product I have not found any cons yet They are extremely comfortable and fashionable The color I purchased is beautiful The solar pink is a nice addition I would recommend these shoes to everybody The only thing that took getting used to was the plastic area on the back near the Achilles But once I got used to it I loved them

I liked the price drop plus that was my first pair

The boost makes the shoe so comfortable and I love it

These shoes are very comfortable They are like walking on clouds

First pair of Adidas the shoe is like walking on a cloud I am now a believer

can not say enough about the look comfort and style

Very good sneaker they run big so make sure to get a half size down but good quality if you like nmd

When it come here it has a lot of yellow stains on the side Bad quality

stylish and comfortable compatible to all event recommended

Comfy shoe Make sure to size down at least half even full size The sock part around the ankles tend to be very loose there should maybe be a way to adjust that

Ultra comfortable

It fits perfectly The shoes are not very tight The soles are swishy

it is a nice pair of shoes White is perfect for pictures

I never purchased NMD R1for myself but I did for my sister She wears them every day and loves the color a lot

I liked them better than vapormax very good looking and comfortable

Amazing show Comfortable and light Can stand around all day and it feels like it is all purpose Only complaint is it runs a bit on the bigger side so if you are thinking about getting a half size bigger because you are in between go on the lower end Otherwise love them

Stretch material around ankle was digging into my skin

I digging these jons Need to have more colors and more merchandise They never usually have the ones I want like size 10 triple black nmd r1 stlt

Wanted to love the shoe Much larger and wider than other Adidas same sized shoes also insole or lack of insole was crunched up in toe box

The tail sole abrass with the heel when wearing short socks causing blister

They fit very true to size and are one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn Defenetly will be picking up some more pairs

A little to small I wear size 12 in everything and i cant wear socks with these because they are just a lottle to small

Came home late Have a hole near the laces Very disappointing Only if the shoe came when they say it will 5 days instead of 2 weeks And please do not give me a ripped shoe Will not trust this brand anymore

These are my first Adidas of any style in over 20 years I did not know what I was missing I work on my feet and these keep me energized and lookin fresh son

NMDs are known for its comfort along with how light the shoes is That said would recommend this product line to anybody who is seeking for comfortable sneakers while being stylish at the same time

This shoe is extremely better looking in person I did not expect them to look and feel as comfortable as they do 10 out of 10

Really comfortable and looks great No complaintS at all

its extremely comfortable and stylish I only picked up one pair during the sale i regret not picking up more

The NMD PK I ordered was a completely different experience of footwear on my feet and I must say it was a surprise to the comfort i experienced in them

Great fittin shoe slightly narrow by the toes but very comfortable

I liked them because of the price and comfort but I wish they did not have the neon green threads

Best purchase ever price drop is awesome could not resist

This shoe has a quility fit and you can wear all day I do not buy any other brand

The boost got cut in half but I do not think I can return

The NMD R1 Primeknit is super comfortable and very stylish They run half a size big so get a half size smaller than what you normally wear

One of the best shoes you can buy from adidas Feels like a sock on your foot and no break in period needed One of my fav shoes I have in my collection because I can wear them with anything Must buy

Very comfortable the knit fabric adjusts softly to your feed I always have problems with shoes being tight on my pinky toe not with this pair

First pair of nmds but def will not be the last Perfect

Nice shoes 1 2 size to small Could be more comfortable

Love the shoes one of the best purchases I have bought in years

Cuz its green and lime green and its Soooooooooooooooooooooooo pretty

Shoe looks great and is comfortable and light I could walk for days in these

Feels very large and too wide The material feels cheap and it does not look like it will last beyond few months

Great quality and comfort light weight Would definitely recommend

The shoe scratched my ankle to the point of bleeding I taped my ankles to prevent that from happening because I liked the look of the shoe itself But the tape kept coming and my heels would bleed again Ultimately had to return them

Very comfy to work out in or just to walk around Highly recommend these in white

Terribly uncomfortable do not buy get women boost instead

I like these becuase they are super comfortable and i liked how they look

The colorway is perfect Love the bottom beige color that goes perfect with wearing khakis Def recommend this colorway

The shoe rubbed against the back of my ankle and had to put some fabric tape over the rough spots Caused a sore to form but with tape no issues

I dobt like the creme tge whole shoe feels good though

Thought the color is not great I was so surprised when it arrived Great buy

Best shoes I have ever worn I will not wear anything else Highly recommend

Love the style and look Simplicity is key and it was met with this product The only thing is that they sole is VERY uncomfortablemy feet hurt badly when I drive with these on

My grandson picked them out and absolutely loves them

I got them on sale Worth it I am a female I am usually a size 8 in the womenNMD and got a size 6 in these They fit perfectly

they are comfortable and do not get hot They also look really nice

My 13 year old loves these shoes but a bit too small and a bit too wide So sorry we need to return and disappoint him because there are no more in stock

Super stylish silhouette that can also function as a workout shoe Boost technology combined with primeknit makes it about as comfortable as it gets

Super comfortable and I have wide feet and ima true 13 but most shoes I have to buy 14 to accommodate for the width Do it was nice having a shoe fit properly

Comfortable lightweight breathable aesthetic and eye catching

Good shoe but only at a low price not 180 but 60 Keep it at 60

Love anything with boost These shoes look good and the primeknit is pure quality

GREAT SHOE but will have to exchange for a smaller size Hopefully if I have time

The combo of boost and primeknit makes for an extremely comfortable shoe Main complaints are that it runs a half size big and that this specific colorway is a bit more pink than the pictures show

I bought these shoes and they are awesome and comfortable but within 2 days of getting them the adidas stripes started falling off Very disappointed

I love this product because of the fabric very nice

Great casual shoes that will also stand up to gym workouts Super comfortable with no break in period The gray with gum bottoms go with everything I wear these everyday Definitely will not be my last pair

Regularly size 11 but 11 was too big and back hurts

very comfortable shoe i normally wear 11 5 but i bought 10 5 and they fit just as well If you want a shoe that will get you ladies at the gym and wherever else you wear them these are your shoes

Great looks and the most comfortable shoe I own Not really a true runner but looks like on It is a litttle too soft to take much of a pounding Look great with shorts and a tee Highly recommended

I recommend to my friend as well

I do like this product but have a few comments So if you are looking to purchase this shoe make sure that you choose a while size or half size smaller Like I wear 11 Us Men but for these I ordered a 10 1 2 Also one thing I want to note is that the build quality personally in my shoe is not to good There is glue and some threads coming out of my shoe I fact I am about to return then and just get another pair to see if anything changes

Good shoe Could be better if your customers were allowed to customize them The NMD black shoes with the red bottoms are fire Bring them back please and please offer a size 14 5 and 15 in the nmd

When I got the shoe and put it on and started walking around I noticed that the heel plastic digs into your feet and causes marks on your leg This became very uncomfortable to walk around and I had to return the shoe because of this I am not sure if this shoe just has that issue if all NMD R1 primeknits have this issue but I would recommend sticking to an either an R1 mesh or R2 primeknit as that does not have any issue on my feet

My two son loved Tha xc3 xads kind of tennis

They are very comfortable and look great on my feet

Feels like walking on air or stepping on marshmallows

If available you should order a half size down because they run big they are also relatively comfortable minus the fact that they do not have an insole Not as comfortable as an UltraBoost but still comfortable Would recommend

extremely comfortable soft thumbs up looks great with khaki shorts excellent summer exercise shoe

Got it for only 60 bucks too with a coupon It was a steal

High quality material in a stylish comfortable product great value for the price

It is a nice shoe but at the end of it there is all of that boost material where you do not put pressure and that seems like a waste

Literally so sad you do not have smaller than a 5 in them

I love his shoe because it is so comfortable and I can just slip them right on

Very comfortable light weigh but the laces go through the prim knit Adidas should have put some kind of loop to put the laces through so the prime knit will not bunch up and rub against the upper part of the foot but overall it is a great shoe thanks Adidas

Love the shoes and how it fits Really light weight and comfortable

Was very pleased with my purchase probably the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn I want to buy more but can not seem to find any Please do not stop making these

Great color Very comfortable Definitely will purchase the same style in more colors

it is the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever bought It cuts my ankle when I wear it in 2hrs Very bad experience about NMD

Price ans promotion is very cool

great shoe but waited a month for it to arrive which was irritating and is the reason for my star rating

Confort quality design

These are the most comfortable and simple shoes that have a really clean look and they are super cheap if you are looking to not spend a whole bunch 10 10 would but 3 more pairs

Product is good Quality really comfortable I would recommend

These feel as if only wearing socks Very comfortable and light Will be buying more soon as I sell off some of my jordan collection

These shoes are very comfortable and look great however they run about half a size larger than I anticipated Little too big for me

Adidas NMDs are the best I own few pairs and would buy more if I have extra money My priority now is my daughter over everything else

The colorway was great Boost was comfortable and had a nice snug fit Would definitely recommend

The box was a little damaged however the show was in perfect condition

im a 3 Stripes man till i die how to become a male fashion model or ambassador for youpls get back to me

I like the product because of the comfort and the style of the shoe

I like the colors and its so easy to wear i do not even have to use hands

The back of the inside of your shoe rubs against ankle

In comparison to similar shoes these are much more comfortable and seem to be very durable I have only had more me for a couple of weeks and have worn them a few times but I already want to get another pair 100 recommend these to anyone looking for a seriously comfortable casual shoe that is good for walking in for long periods of time I am a definite fan of the boosts

Very comfortable Slightly tight around my toes I have wide feet so I think I would order half a size up next time

Very nice design with easy to slip in and out It helps with busy individuals on the move

Great nmd adidas innovative creativity in their products is why I keep buying from them You will not be disappointed in any Adidas Boost product

Personal information we want to protect your privacy

Thank you ADIDAS

Size is a little smaller then my actual size and the boost should be covered in some protective material so it would not get dirty as much

I totally like them and I am buying them again in other styles and colors

How do people wear these without feeling the back of the shoes rubbing against your back heels I think its really uncomfortable

My son loves Adidas nmd he has several pairs This one is a dark army green color with neat textile print They look great

very comfortable and light I love them I recommend it

I got these nmd in a red color way and may I say the shoes are very high quality The boost is very soft but not to soft

Love the comfort level that the NMDs have to offer

I love the shoes because they are very comfortable and look great

Runs slightly larger so I ordered a half size smaller from my TTS They fit great Love the looked of the original NMD R1

Color is not true as shown in pictures it is more pink

I really like the primeknit upper The only problem is that the inner foam block somewhat digs into your foot as you walk

Shipping was fast and size is accurate when I am wearing the shoes it feels like I have nothing on my feet super lite

Perfect fit stays comfortable and soft troughout the whole day

Other reviews said to go half a size down so that is what I did I fully regret it because my feet hurt every day I thought there was some break in period but it is still just as bad For what it is worth the shoe is still really light and comfy when my feet are not hurting I know in the future to just stick to my usual size I am an outlier though use your best judgement when it comes to sizing I will say the quality of the shoe is really high I can tell this shoe will last a long time Also I get the rubbing on my ankle from the tag but I read that it smooths out after a while

I got a pair of these a couple days ago and I have had some time to wear them They are really comfortable shoes I would suggest going half a size down The width is almost spot on with my feet Overall a great shoe it is definetly worth the price

Beautiful shoes nice to hang out not for running or going to the gym Hurts a little on the back of the foot heel because the shoe has a high back Anyway i would recommend it

They are comfortable and good looking I wear them all the time My other pairs of nmds are just as comfortable I think think this is a shoe everyone would love

I knew the STLT primeknits would be flimsy but I did not expect them to give me just as much support as my socks do I ordered the size I get all my sneakers in but the pair was still way too big for me Returned them and got Ultraboosts instead

I wish I would gone up 1 2 size Overall I really like the shoes The sizing mistake was mine

They Fit weirdly did not like the pattern in person

I love these shoes I needed daily trainers to wear and these were a perfect choice I can wear them for basic duties and also combine them with my outfits to make a wonderful fashion statement

The boost on the shoes is super soft and I can wear them all day and walk all day without feeling a thing it is amazing

Stretch fabric to accomodate wide feet Feel more like a slipper than running shoe

Very comfortable and love the look Would buy them again

Fits true to size No smell when worn without socks If you plan to walk or run long distance in these shoes the small Adidas patch near the front of the sneakers can cause some rubbing to your pinky toes The NMD R2 does not have this issue But the R1 is a way more better looking sneaker

The shoe really makes my feet feel weightlessit is so incredibly comfortable

it is comfortable I like the color and it is easy to wear

They are very comfy shoes My favorite to wear and are great for long walks

Soooo comfortable They are light weight Feels like you do not have shoes on

I like this product because it is very comfortable and has good quality materials

the fit on this one felt looser because I bought the NMD R2 at the same time was worried at first that my fist would move around too much but I have adjust to the fit and it is great does not feel tight just right Fits true to size

Awesome purchase waiting for more deals Will buy more

This is my first pair of Adidas shoes They are extremely comfortable My only concern going forward is I am not sure how to clean them I bought the white model and they are already partially dirty but I still get compliments everywhere I go

Comfortable and durable

Adidas nmd are flexible light and comfortable Easy to slip on and off

Probably one of the best NMD models thay exist Also the triple black is a score

These shoes are light stylish and most of all comfortable shoes for everyday wear They fit according to my normal shoe size and have an extremely handy pull tab that makes putting these shoes on extremely easy Definitely recommend

Because it is very smooth and cool shoe easy to put on and off

These NMDs are my go to so stylish comfy and unisex I wear 9 5 In women NMDs and a 9 in men NMDs

Super comfortable upper Tough enough but soft like a sock

Uncomfortable Definitely not feel like prime knit as described

I would buy more pairs at the sale price I usually wear 12 5 wide The regular 12 5 is wide enough in this shoe The shoe is light it is good quality so far The cushioning is lacking for standing up all day as 300lb man I live the olive color and the touch of volt on the sole is cool

These shoes are incredibly comfortable Because I have wide feet they are a bit snug but that is expected as I also went true to size As for the quality the prime knit is great but a little glue is visible around the midsole The boost is black but was already scratched a little bit I GREATLY prefer the black boost over white simply because it will not get as dirty as quickly so I hope to see more shoes with darker midsoles soles

Stylish and semi comfortable need to be worn in but eventually a very good fit

These are my favorite pair of NMDs for everyday wear Incredibly comfortable and easy to style They run a little large so I would recommend sizing down 5 or 1 for that perfect sock runner look and do not worry once you break in the primeknit a little they will be unbelievably comfortable

The back tag cuts into your ankle if you try to run with these for more than 10 minutes If you are wearing them just for casual wear they are probably okay but I purchased them to train and was severely let down

This product is very comfortable and has a good arch for my foot

Great product from Adidas I will be buying another pair in a different color

it is almost perfect except for the white sole Like the design confort and almost almost everything

Nice fit very comfortable with the shoe Its nice to wear during this summer days

Comfy shoes Look great Wish there was a solid black version

I liked it mainly for the comfort but also for the looks However it would have been nicer with an insole

They fit and felt really nice looked good to Meep

The shoe is a perfect fit and the price is not too bad it is worth the money you are paying especially if you are looking for a comfortable and easy to wear shoe

So far I absolutely love them they are comfortable I can not complain about these shoes

I love NMD and the Ultra Boost and have many pairs of them But I think it needs to be rejuvenated a bit I always wanted to see a Boost midsole come in a variety of colors besides primarily just white and Black Many of the 4 0 models would have benefited with a Black or different colored midsole which would spice it up a bit I know I would be interested if that happened Either way I still think the Ultra Boost is the most comfortable shoe on the planet

Amazingly comfortable Width is perfect Overall amazing shoes Would purchase again

The shoes go with everything and everytime i step in the gym i feel like a model

The shoe is made is made of super lite and comfortable Material

just great shoes with heat fabric and good color choices in the design

These kicks are great they are my first of the nmd i will be buying more

Great show fits well even for people with wider feet A little bit long on the tip of the shoe but not awkward at all

very comfortable according to my husband and the price is perfect

Looks cheap The sole looks just glued on with glue residues visible Did not even try wearing it for fear it will fall off Returning it tomorrow Sadly this is my 3rd Adidas purchase in last few months and while not all looked poorly made they were Stripes peeling off and knits unraveling

Great shoes in a great color I hope to see more like this soon

I like the product a lot it is a super comfortable shoe

NMDs are one of the best shoes I have Have couple of NMDs in my collection and it is pretty comfortable to wear

Love boost love the color the glue on the front of the shoe is noticeable but not a deal breaker 9 8 out of 10

Bought it for my son who wants to get a pair of Adidas badly He loves it Great quality Too pricey before sales

This shoe is perfect I love the way they fit they are extremely comfortable I can wear these all day if I was not so worried about getting them dirty Perfect feel fit and look I bought I 5923before these and the NMD R1 blows them out of the water

can not really go wrong with these all black comfortable shoes that look awesome Will definitely be buying more NMDs in the future

Awesome design and style I am a huge fan of Adidas

I love the style and comfort Everywhere I go they draw positive attention It will be a favorite to wear

Stylish comfortable and great price They basically go with everything and anything black white and red can not lose

I recommend always wearing socks the mesh in the toe area wears down overtime and that is exacerbated when worn barefoot Otherwise very comfortable and versatilecan be worn for exercise or casually

Comfy asf good boost shoe for the price Will be buying more

They fit perfectly and fit great Comfortable all day long

I like it because it is comfortable and the looks are amazing

Very cool shoes Comfortable and stylish You can dress up any outfit

they are comfortable and go with everything I wear them out everywhere and get many compliments

After only wearing the shoes on 2 occasions I walked in the sneakers for a couple of hours and my feet were killing me for about 3 days after I can not wear the sneakers anymore Really not suitable to walk around in

So comfortable my best purchase in the Adidas I recomend

I like the shoes I just do not like how the back rubs up agains my Achilles I can not wear the shoes for very long because the backing really starts to hurt if there is a way to fix that please get back to me But other than that I can not complain about them really comfy and really supportive

Great stability yet the shoe is very comfortable and is awesome for the gym

Comfortable and stylish Great colorway and nice touch on gum bottom

A lot of people recommended these to me when I was looking for something new They fit great feel great and I am happy with them They are not the walking on a cloud experience they were made to be but that does not discount that they are much better than what I had been wearing previously Would definitely purchase again

Quality shoe Pure boost sole is very comfortable to walk around on all day

like some others have said the back of shoes rub onto your ankle if your socks are not high enough put an insole in and you can go with your regular size otherwise good shoes

Comfort is unmatched A friend of mine recommended buying a half size smaller great call

I have pretty wide feet and yet these shoes felt a bit big It was not enough to make me return them but I definitely had to lace them up tighter I would recommend going a half size down

So comfortable you forget it is a shoe I highly recommend these

Great shoe Great design Love the gum bottom

Read Title

Dope shoes and they are so comfortable would recommend forsure

very comfortable shoes at great price will recommend to a friend

Love how they look and feel Great support too I would definitely recommend these sneakers to others

The Primeknit on the NMD R1 PKis excellent in breathablity and comfort but can cause problems for people with wide feet in that the primeknit does not provide any hold for your foot especially in the arch of your foot leading do your foot slightly leaning in and causing discomfort Also consider moving 5 to 1 size down as these shoes do run a tad large

Money is well spent and a great pair of shoes and I am planning to buy another pair soon

The material of the shoes remind me of the ultra boost but not as comfortable I am not a huge fan

Simply perfect Absolutely love the comfort they brings Feel like walking barefeet on mattress First pair of addidas shoes have ever owned and will definitely come back for future purchases

Most comfortable best fitting shoes Great fit feels true to size

To hard to put on To hard to put on I did not like the way they slipped on

I like it because it looks good and its really comfortable

Perfect shoes for the price and quality Love the gum bottoms

It is one of the best and most comfortable shoes that i have ever purchased

Comfy a little big around the primeknit Overall good shoe

Feels like I am walking on a cloud The shoes are featherweight while still maintaining high quality

My son says these are the most comfortable shoe ever

The shoes are really comfortable and good alternative to ultraboost The only thing I did not like was the golden yellowish grip on the front of the shoes

I have owned a pair of nmdbefore but the black and gum are by far my fav colorway Loved them so much got a pair for my husband too

Comfort quality looks this show has it all would by again

I love the nmd platform this shoe is super comfortable

it is a clout type shoe very popular and I think it is great

I needed comfort These totally provided the comfort I needed

Very comfortable laces are long tho but found a way to wear them loose

These shoes are extremely comfortable The white with the gum bottom are classics Get you a pair

I am very happy with the product Stylish good quality and comfortable

Stylish comfortable I have wanted these shoes for a long time

Very comfortable and wearable would recommend them to anyone

I loved this shoe ever since i laid eyes on it I wore this show off and on for a couple months Then at the tip on the shoe the fabric started to rip Im very disappointed at the quality

I would like smaller size options Would love to get some for my younger boys

Good and comfortable seem to be holding up well but to be determined later on

5th pair love the fit of all of them I would highly recommend this shoe

I like the style and it is light easy to wear I have been wanting one of this shoes and now I got them I love adidas since then I collect them I just ordered another 2 pair which match me and my girlfriend

I got my first NMDs a few months ago and was amazed at how comfortable they were So when I saw a black colorway was finally available I did not hesitate to get another pair it is hard to find nice stylish and comfortable shoes for my wide feet But NMDs have been perfect for me

It was exact what my son wanted He was extremely happy when he recieved it Very comfortable for sure Great buy

I bought these for my grandson and he LOVES them He loves the color and the fit Very comfortable

Slightly small so went up a size Otherwise best sneaker I have worn

The heel design is terrible Absolutely terrible Extra big and bulky do not get me wrong the shoes are very comfortable But from the side view in person it is laughble Whoever designed these extra large heels You might wanna get a job a payless shoes

My kid loves the shoes Would recommend to anyone

As for the sizing they are slightly big I went half size down and it fit me perfect but if you have narrow feet then go a full size down

Its definitely a different kind of Primenit maybe they changed up the materials used Slightly tighter than other primenits Maybe i have to break them in some but other ones were much roomier than these Definitely order a half size larger Same quality though Super breathable amazing comfort cool style and color pattern

My son favorite pair Color is verry cool They so so light

Very comfortable and they fit super nicely The primekit make the shoe more moveable

They are what I thought they had be Except they are a bit annoying if you wear ankle socks

other than that I LOVE ADIDAS shoes Great quality and craftsmanship and materials

Order a 1 2 size down from what you would think and you will be stellar

I like this product because it looks lit and feels comfortable

I like the color of the shoe how it is a good combination and so comfortable

It was great purchase worth the money was a little sad when i got them dirty but cleans up nice very comfortable for its price not like ultra boost but a step down

Such a trendy and super comfortable shoe Please do not stop making nmd

I bought these shoes for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loves them Perfect fit cute and arrived on time

Way more pink in person I had to return them Good shoe thought

Super comfy you can not go wrong with this shoes great buy like always

Looks good and very comfy got another pair on the way

Love these shoes Very comfortable and stylish True to size

I like this product because they are stylish comfortable and support my feet

I do not like it because there is a no women sizes

Attractive colors and very comfortable

I got this pair as a gift and when I first saw them I thought these would be my favorite shoes Sadly I was wrong The Primeknit was not as stretchy or as cool as the Primeknit on my XR1 model This was warm with little stretch The heel area constantly rubbed against my heel which caused massive discomfort The shoe itself was also very narrow and I am a wide footer Overall the shoes look nice the build is nice but the fit and feel is not good

I know the NMD market has been fairly saturated at this point but simple color ways like this always get my attention Had to get these the second I saw them definitely recommend them to everyone If you have not had a pair buy a half size down

I have always like the NMD 1 its a comfortable shoe and I like the color

Second pair of NMDs I bought First the XR1Then these R1And now I have officially purchased my third pair The CS2 PK I can say with confidence that NMDs and any Boost shoe especially prime knit versions are absolutely wonderful I hate wearing normal shoes now

Overall I am going to return these since they are not comfortable low quality and too large

Good price and really nice shoes my son love this brand

Some of the most comfortable and lightweight shors I have purchased The all white color scheme is a real head turner and earned me a few compliments

These Run a size too large Offer them in 4 or 4 5 Or make them in Big kid sizes

Really disappointed in the sizes offered I am a 6 5 but that was not an option The 6 was way too small and the 7 was way too big but a 7 5 is offered and its not even offered as a womens option I had been waiting months and months for the all white to be are released only to be let down

These are nice and comfortable shoes perfect fit

The shoe size fits perfect This is a mans shoes so if you are a girl order 1 5 sizes down I normally wear an 8 5 so I ordered the 7 and it is perfect It also feels like your walking on clouds The only thing that is bad is that if you wear ankle socks it might give you a blister This could be from my socks though I just put band aids on and I am good to go I would definitely recommended these shoes for traveling in or just for wearing around I do not work out in these shoes

These shoes are beautiful to look at The only catch is you have to keep them clean and fresh so more than likely you have to purchase cleaning supplies I love them and so does everyone else

Really comfortable great for everyday uses Size is also perfect

More comfortable than I expected The primeknit upper makes a big difference They do seem to run a little big but it is not insane It makes it more comfortable width wise

These shoes are perfect for the summer Easy on and off

Like the style looks very good This sentence just to finish review

yeah because it is really comfortable and they look good with outfits and stuff

This product is the best purchase I have ever made It is one of the most comfortable shoes ever made too I recommend going a half size down though

Great workout shoes I recommend for anyone with flat feet

Wonderfully designed My son feet look great and he is so happy

These are the greatest kicks So glad I got them

Looks and feels perfect Easy to slip on and off I call them my airport shoes because how easy it is to get them off and on

Cuz of the quality of the shoe Addidas is coming back hard

I have a narrow foot and I had to tighten the laces to wear the shoe this creases and folds the material under the laces and alters the good looks too much

Great shoe Light and very comfortable Fit perfectly

Great quality and fast shipping plus these shoes are so dope Love these all white and will be buying other pairs

it is an overall good quality shoe Is exactly what you expect

comfortable and not so expensive Good for most of yours

Love this pair Great work shoes recommend for sure

Overall comfortable shoe for running or daily wear

I went true to size with these like i did with my uncaged ultraboost and pureboost which was a mistake I reccomend going a half size down which is really confusing I wish the sizing for Adidas shoes was consistent The blocks on the side of the shoe kinda dig in to your foot making the shoe a bit uncomfortable Also the boost material is a lot less comfortable that that on the pureboost and ultraboost despite being the same price The heel area of the shoe also feels a bit stiff which adds some discomfort as well Aesthetically speaking the shoes are great but I thought Adidas did not compromise comfort for looks

Ive loved the Nmds from adidas for 2yrs now my first pair was the Nmd r2 pk and it was ok but it wasnt great my new pair looks like a million dollars but there are a few glue stains which really made me displeased but besides that i still really really like them

This afternoon as I was wearing them I noticed something stuck to the bottom of my foot I expected to see gum or a sticker of some sort but instead I found part of the sole peeling off Now mind you these shoes are three weeks old and this is literally the third or fourth day I have worn them I will call customer service for a replacement or refund but I am still disappointedu2026 I really wanted to like the shoes

looks good and feels good very stylish and fun to create outfits with the pink on the inside is sexy af when they are just sitting on your shelf I have received many complements too teen in highschool

Best purchase ever I paid the good price Very satisfied

Super comfy and stylish Only problem I have is that it does tend to keep heat from my feet inside but perfect besides that

By far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I bought them for everyday purposes but went for a run in them and they feel better than my running shoes

Best pair of shoes I have ever purchased They look amazing and are very comfortable

Despite these being more casual style shoes they are extremely capable walkers Took these on a trip and walked thirty miles in three days I was never fatigued while my friends were dying to keep up

These shoes aresuper dope and comfortable this is my second pair They are try to size and feel as if I am walking around in socks

This shoe is perfect in every wayQuality look and how comfortable it is Now it may be a little big at first but it is easy to get used to All in all this shoe is worth getting and in my opinion probably the best looking prime knit NMD on the market

Fits perfectly like a gloves on my feet

My first NMD Very happy Adidas 5 star all the way Thanks

Everything fit perfectly

Really comfortable shoes Adidas is the way to go

I love the boost materials Light as a feather The color way is great and they look dope with shorts

They look dope and are like walking on clouds Only problem is they run slightly bigger than the uncaged ultraboosts Got a 12 but 11 5 would be probably be perfect

These shoes are really great looking They are very light and very comfortable Very much recommended

I liked that it is unique but there are a lot of features that can be improved on The side that had Adidas gets stained easily

Love the lower profile slightly roomier than Ultra Boost More like uncaged

I like the price point when they are on sale but not retail

Dope shoe But the top is soft so I cannot wear it because my feet are shaped weird

Shoe is somewhat narrow for someone who has wide feet Could feel the inner edge of the shoe but get used to it longer I wear it Overall very comfortable

It was a gift for my teenage son He loves it Fits and looks great

price quality A comfortable recommend this prduct

The colorway in the picture is a little different in person

I like the product vey comfortable although it is a little to big for the size and wide

Too toght on top where the laces are otherwise great

did not know it had a orange color on the side

The Boost shoes are amazing These are some of the most comfortable I have ever owned Not a great running shoe but these are not built for that Would highly recommend for walking and general working out

Most comfortable NMD I have so far and I am not disappointed

One more that I bought NMD is the best My favorite shoes

Best looking shoes imho nmd are really comfortable

Great show but first time ordering adidas so got the wrong size It was to big

These have restored my faith in nmd I have another pair and they are not comfortable

Stitching coming undone Otherwise comfortable can not wear as they are falling apart

kudos love their primeknit line just worried how to keep it clean so i use scotch guard on them we will see

they are fire Just a little wide but other than that they are awesome

I love the look of this shoe I love the look of the heel cage and the plugs bricks I just wish it was a little bit more comfortable The midsole and sole seem pretty hard compared to other boost shoes and you can feel the plugs bricks through the Primeknit Other than that the Primeknit is very nice feeling and it just hugs your foot I do not think the laces really do anything but the Primeknit stretches around your foot for an extremely comfortable upper They are very easy to put your foot in as well Side noteI would purchase a half down from your true size

The material is just great and so comfortable while running or training

I was hoping to love this shoes but I was disappointed

Very very comfortable shoe I love the overall feel of the material and fit

I have 23 different shoes and this is my favorite

I like this product because it is a Good lifestyle shoe and they are very comfortable After about 4 months the fabric starts to stretch so they get to wide and the soles become yellow

it is so comfortable I love it nmd the best thanks adidas

Overall a comfortable shoe the finish not so great glue marks show around the edge of the sole

Only complaint is the amount of excess glue Very comfortable I love the triple black color way too

Comfortable nmd nmd mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Wore them once and upper feels like its going to rip

I am usually a 6 5 in womens size and I got size 5 It fits perfectly The shoe is really comfy and I love how it looks

I bought these for my husband as a fatherday gift and he knew these were his gift He could not wait until the 17th to wear them he is absolutely in love with them He claims they are the most comfortable shoes he owns now

First time trying out boost or adidas in general really impressed with the quality and feel Shoes are way more comfortable than my last pair way higher quality

The shoes are comfortable and stylish to wear with any style

worst purchase bad quality too big and missing the inside cushion

Good shoe but after i scratched the shoe the boost scraped and was white and stiching looks like glue and visbile right above the boost overall good shoe

i bought this for me and my husband as a couple shoes we LOVE IT I am size 7 in women size and got size 6 for men size and it perfectly fit to me our FIRST NMD

I read that I need to size down half size but I take the risk and ordered in my size and they are perfect Very comfy and look awesome

It is very comfortable and stylish Easy to keep clean

Fits perfect it is soft comfortable beautiful I am honored to have this shoe Send me a second

Definitely worth the money ive been looking for some shoes for work since I am on my feet all day long and these shoes have done the job No more pain and extremely comfortable

The shoes fit just the way I want them to and they are very confronting These are great shoes

Love the shoe but they have a poor finish There is an excess of glue around the top of the shoe

Was comfortable but after walking a while I got a blister in the back of my foot

These are my first boost shoes and why are better than I expected

Too wide and big need a smaller size but this brand run big

Very light and comfortable Every day shoes for me

Love the style of these shoes already owned a pair of ultraboosts so I sized from those only to find they run about a half size big Other than that great shoes

I was a little hesitant about buying these since I have never had this type of shoe before I received multiple complements and after a few days of wearing them breaking them in they are much more comfortable I typically wear a women 8 5 and ordered a men 7

I enjoy this Awesome those shoes Thanks for support me

Very comfortable good quality great price A

These are pretty comfortable Maybe the most comfortable of all shoes I own Fit pretty true to size and look great on the foot

I like these for daily run around use They look great match almost anything and are super comfortable I would consider these like the new future icon shoe lifestyle must have As for preformance I would rather stick with my ultraboost and am4la

the soles are coming off I wear size 8 5 but this time it was too large

I like the way it looks and sits only pro was that it is about quarter inch too large I have wide feet so I am not even complaining

If you want to feel like your walking on water and the same time feel stylish BUY THESE SHOES

Some slight differences from the photo online Bottoms are not lime green but there are small lime green stripes on the top on the head of the shoe Also almost like a camouflage pattern to them

Quick shipping Very comfy ordered a size 5 men and I am a 7 5 women they fit perfect

I am new to the ultraboost and these are my first pair Hands down the comfiest sneakers I have owned I absolutely love them enough to write a review

I went from the og triple black R1 to this shoe They are super comfortable the prime knit upper is a lot more comfortable Just wish the hole for the shoe laces had a cage like the regular R1

Worn them 3 times and got a hole on the top of the shoe and my toe went through the shoe

Fit is amazing and is incredibly comfy to walk around in

After finding similar shoes in the Adidas outlet I went online to find the right color and shoe size These are very comfortable shoes while looking fairly good

Very comfortable but the R1 run a half size big so order accordingly

This is a good quality shoe that is very comfortable Only thing I do not like is the fact that it does not come with Insoles I have to wear them for a while to see if that is gonna bother me They are very light maybe too light you forget your wearing shoes I highly recommend them

This is the perfect shoe from the build feel and style

So far so good Worn them a handful of times and they are by far the most comfortable pair of shoes I currently own I will definitely be purchasing more Adidas with boost comfort in the future It does not hurt they look awesome too

These shoes are amazing Very comfortable and good looking

I love the style and the comfort I need a half size bigger Unless you already have a pair of the NMDit is kind of difficult to order because Adidas run bigger than most sneakers

The sneakers quality was very good but they do not come with insoles and that made the sneaker very uncomfotable

They are light weight and very comfortable I am on my feet at work for over 8 hrs and have no issues at the end of my shift

I like because it fit very very good thang like it was almost perfect but little too big

The shoes are so comfy it is almost like your not even wearing shoes

Stylish and comfortable A great value when they are on sale

Awesome shoes nothing compares in terms of comfort is concerned it has been my best choice just take care a little more the finished and the aesthetic of the shoe as everything else is beautiful

I liked that they released it as a black and white pack Which is why I bought both

I really like these shoes I even bought my wife matching pairs They look really great and are comfy

These are literally like wearing a thick pair of socks The boost material is amazing and it is awesome to wear for running around all day or if you have to rush out the house real quick for something Definite head turner also

The shoes are wonderful very comfortable and fit well Looks pretty cool

Such a lite shoe makes you feel like you are wearing socks

Similar to what other reviewers have stated the primeknit does run a little large My true size is a men9 and typically wear a 9 5 in most other brands I went with a 9 on this shoe but an 8 5 would have fit just as well given the stretch in the upper Unlike other primeknits the foot opening for this has some stretch to make it easier to get the shoe on and off Will definitely purchase again

Love them Fit perfect more comfortable than my other nmd

A great pair for days when I gotta get out of work shoes and just let my feet rest it is almost like walking without shoes

Returned them Looked good Felt too big wrong size a guess

Comfortable and great price would recomend this is my 7th pair of NMD I love them

Really great shoes When I walk around with them it feels like I am walking in a trampoline Honestly amazing

It is not comfortable while wakling They put a hard plastic logo at back and you can feel it every time you take a step

Very comfortable and stylish was in the airport for 8hrs and my feet were comfortable the entire time

it is comfortable and very stylish I could walk around in them daily or I can use them in the gym was a good

Insanely comfortable like basically wearing a pair of socks with soles

These shoes are dope Perfect fit extreme comfort and dang these shoes look fresh on the feet The only thing that would take these shoes to another level is if you could customize them

Shoe is extreamly comfortable Light weight and sizes run true The color combination is great and people notice these shoes Would highly recommend

I like so much very very comfortable I like the color

Love the black boost Easy to slip on Comfy Cool shoe

My first purchase of NMD types shoes I have only heard about how great and comfortable they are It was not until I saw a recent sale for NMD Primeknits R1 I decided was the a good opportunity as any to get me a pair

I have plenty of boost in my shoe collection but these have not left my feet in the past week The look on feet look way better in person do not miss out on these what a great shoe

I feel like I am walking on air I am going to buy more of this style

Material is so stretchy and hugs your foot just right I got a size 6 and It feels not too tight but I think I could have gotten by with a size 5 especially since it is stretchy

Great modern take on a classic running shoe Super light and comfortable Always get lots of compliments on them

Super comfortable and gives you enough room if you need arch support inserts line I do I always get a half size smaller cause they usually run big Adidas never disappoints

My pair had glue in the seams all over May be why they were on such a big sale Otherwise they are super comfortable and fit well Moving forward I recommend to by in store to see what pair you will be purchasing

I thought the shoe would fit but it feels like a size too big

Comfortable shoes very snug and fashionable GF loves them

Fit perfectly for comfort I love it and delivery was on point

I bet this is what it feels like to walk in the clouds

Co worker recommended and I am glad I made the purchased

I really like the product because it feels very comfortable

The style is great and it matches and looks good with most outfits However I do not think hey are very comfortable

Visible glue marks throughout the show give it a cheap look

I like them because they are comfortable and looks good for casual dressing

Very comfy and it match well with any city style be it shorts or jeans Agree with others that the PK version is a tad bigger and the normal one and going half size down is just perfect to me

I like it is just cut too small Seems comfortable and great material but half size too small and a little narrow Wish I new this before ordering because I would have ordered a half size bigger

Great design super comfortable and very stylish

i wish the mesh was a little tighter but i can complain This shoe is worth buying

I bought these for my friend birthday present and as soon as they arrived I immediately wanted a pair for myself So I went ahead and bought myself a pair and let me tell you I am so happy I did They are super light and comfortable almost feels as if I am walking barefoot cause they are so light I love these shoes

This is the second pair of Prime Knit NMDs that I have purchased They are light weight and comfortable however they feel a bit looser in the width compared to my other pair of Prime Knit NMDs I wish the fit had a bit more snug In addition I wish these shoes had more arch support

IT A FINE PRODUCT COMFORTABLE BUT JUST A LITTLE LOOSE TO RUN MANY MILES THEY ARE OK FOR GYM TRAINING BUT IF YOU WANT TO RUN LONG DISTANCES I WOULD CHOOSE ANOTHER ONE

First i feel a little bit tight Not sure if this model suits for me or not After wearing a couple of times It turns out very fit I also like the simplicity of its design Very light confident for a long run

This is my second pair of NMD R1s They are so comfortable and versatile I wear them a lot Perfect for walking around the city without sacrificing style

I have a pair of Regular Carbon NMDs and they fit much better I was disappointed that the heel plugs dig into my feet which causes me to feel annoyed with every step They are much looser than my other pair as well Also the back rubs against my Achilles causing irritation I want to love this shoe but I do not It looks great but I will have to find a pair of insoles that solve the problems of the plug digging into my feet it is wierd that the right shoe feels different than the left one Unfortunately I took the tag off these and have been wearing them outside so I will not be able to return them

I love the color and style I had been wanting some nmd for a while and was very pleased with the look and feel I am definitely buying another pair soon

do not miss this chance and buy it it is sooooo great love it

I wore them two times and after the second time there was a hole in my right one

Comfort and style Great shoe that is highly desirable

This product is good but the problem with it is that it is hard to clean

Feels like you are wearing slippers So comfortable

They are comfortable and stylish and they match an th thing I wear I the think the xr1and the stltare the best nmd 

Second pair love this shoe would highly recommend for everyday use

I went half a size down because many reviews mentioned they ran slightly big However for me this was not the case Width wise they seem fine however my toes are pushing against the end of the shoe I am not sure if I received a weirdly sized pair but I would order your normal size or even half a size up

I like this product because of the look and its comfort

Unfortunately the shoe is a little too big but other than that the shoe is extremely lightweight and very comfortable I highly recommend you buy them

I purchased these a half size down and thinking they would come in a core black colorway but when I received them in the mail it turns out they were more of a purple than black I am very disappointed with how the picture portrayed the true color of the shoes Plan on returning these and finding something else

I like this product because of the confort I dislike that the boost sole of the shoe gets dirty easily

Extremely comfortable Lightweight feels good on and it is easy color allows me to wear them with anything I feel like putting on that day Very happy

I did like the product because it is very comfortable and it is easy to put on

Feels amazing almost like nothing on your feet Super light weight I LOVE THEM

Wish I would have tried these out sooner

Shoe is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable I am flat footed and have wide feet so I can feel my foot spill over the sole a little bit But they are still great shoes Plus they get a lot of compliments

I do not like it because they are too wide and wrinkle

I work on my feet all day and these are amazing Flexible yet still stable With enough cushion to keep my feet from not being in pain

I recently purchased these as my new Summer athletic sneaker and they are great

Comfort is important this pair fulfilled it love the color

The added decoration on the exterior of the bottom of the shoe rubs into the foot The black plastic line pieces

Sick colorway love this version and sizing width are perfect

This is the nicest pair of shoes I have ever owned They are super comfortable and light weight Feeling super fresh

I love the NMD line They are lightweight and durable I have a few pairs of NMDand they are literally all I wear I travel a lot so it is a nice shoe to wear when I fly or on long drives Even great walking around cities and exploring Really comfortable and are my go to shoe

My son loved them but they got a hole in the toe within the first 3 days of wearing them The material is very thin

The material on the top of the shoe looks liked ribs running across the top of the shoes appears to be fuzzy after just a few wears I had to take a clothes shaver to the fabric but it did not help muchribs still look fuzzy Otherwise a solid sneaker

it is just so comfortable light weight I have a few pairs now all I am going to buy is nmd from now on

so comfortable to walk in i would buy again but i already have a pair

These are sooo comfortable and cheap defiantly worth buying and I will probly buy another pair soon

I love them Stylish and comfortable just a bit wide for a women to wear but still works out well

My son recommended these sneakers to me and I could not be happier I would recommend the sneakers to anyone

want to buy one in every color great gift for my brothers

it is not too bad but I recommend just getting ultra boosts

NMD is the Best The best purchase I made for shoes

My kid has complained about blisters on the high Achilles area Rough fabric

This show is amazing it so coftorable and I recommend these to anyone who like a lifestyle type of shoe and overall are a really good looking

Comfortable and stylish started to like them and i want more of nmd

Shoes is comfortable and I recommend to anyone to buy them

it is like wearing slippers socks while still being stylish The only complaint I have is that the tag on the back and back of the shoe rub on my heel and have made it very irritating Back of my heel hurts and is red but I think that is due to it being a little large and my foot not being secure in the shoe suggest ordering a 1 2 size down

Shoes fit perfectly and are perfect for everyday wear or for the gym

this particular pair of sneakers from adidas i will not recommend to any of my close friends or family but other adidas shoes most likely

I bought this for my ex husband and he loves it because of the comfort while he works and on his feet all night

Very comfortable Slip them on it is like an air cushion sock Walked around for 9 hours and my feet were just super comfortable

I was playing some very light basketball and my toe popped out of the mesh The shoes look great and feel pretty nice If you get these do not plan on doing anything athletic in them I only had the shoes for a week

Run small i just returned them originally got 9 I am reordering 9 5

Bought these for my son he absolutely loves them

I Love the shoes I definitely recommend it just bought a size too small

It was a gift for my son and he loves them They look good and are comfortable Too soon to rate quality

The shoe is a 10 10 from design to comfort Definitely would go half size down for the perfect fit

Adiddas delivery super fast and quality and comfort of sneaker is better than Nike

I have had so many complements wearing this shoes I am like a walking advertisement at the gym I have had 3 different people ordered nmd Shoes on their smartphone right there and then I highly recommend you to buy this shoes for its unique looks and comfort

This is my 2nd pair of NMD and I like them so much They are comfortable have a nice fit and they are stylish

I got tons of compliments on my shoes They feel so comfortable and I love using during my gym workout I always feel good when I am working out in style yet flat enough to use during squats I highly recommend this shoes

It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn It is very light I came home after work wearing my old shoes to find these in the porch and stepping into these felt like walking on a cloud Hard for narrow feet though

Primeknit Separated from sole after wearing them 3 times

These ripped two days after getting them I was literally walking through the mall and looked down and saw my shoe was ripped Pulled the out of the box as I was my first time actually wearing them after the day I got it did not jog run or hike haha I have multiple colors and I rethink talking my remaining pair out now Other then that adidas quality is top notch

I had to have this black NMD bc it is in my fave color I could not believe it was not sold out I am a women 9 and got a 7 since this is a men shoe Runs true to size and shipping was super fast I am going to wear these all the time So excited about the fact that these will almost never have to be cleaned

I have had these shoes for about a week and a half they are the most comfortable shoes ever and they look amazing in person

Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned Would recommend this to anyone

very nice and comfortable shoes But a little expensive

Our family buys dozens of Adidas shoes every year and love all their products including clothing I bought these in size 5 Men for my son and the width is so large It makes the shoes look ugly and it is uncomfortable We have purchased other size 5 Men before and never had a problem

I have two of the NDM Originals and really love them When these black ones came out I ordered them right away Unfortunately they are slightly smaller than the other two pairs and I had to return them

My son loves them He said they are little narrow but no big deal he is really happy with them

Love the shoes Super comfortable and fast shipping

Shoes are comfortable and colors are the best Everything matches

Twas soooooo good like the best I have ever had in my life

I love nmd Series Especially this color combo Or many have seen this color

The comfort took me by surprise The lightweight design feels perfect and the style can not be beat

My son 12 turned me onto NMDs since his buddies at school all wear them I wear them in the office They are very comfy

They are lightweight and comfortable But you have to order a bigger size than what I wear

It is more comfortable for you to choose 1 2 bigger

The knit on the shoes is very thick and it does not stretch that much about a 1 2 size to small but very comfortable but not the best quality for 130 shoes sign up for newsletter 15 off

They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

Love the look of the shoes quality is very good I would recommend these to any one

This product is comfortable and stylish The nmd 2 white with red sole is my next purchase

it is a great shoe the fit is fine but it is so difficult to get on and off that I end up putting my Nikes on most of the time anyways

Love Adidas because of its modern designs and durability

quality material quality is great

My first ever pair of NMDs and they feel so snug on my foot and so comfortable Already saving up to buy myself another pair

Very comfortabledefinitely enough ventilation flow thru love the color stack They look sharp and garnered a few looks on first wearing in public I expect you will see them on my feet a lot more this spring

These shoes are really comfy and they look really good

Love the shoe One of the most comfortable shoes to run or workout with

I enjoy the comfort of this shoe and the light weight Looks good too

Solid Walking on clouds I will definitely be ordering another pair

for some reason this one runs half a size too small I have had other pairs and 11 was spot on This time it was to small Now ordering 11 5

I love this shoe and i have not even got it yet but my friend let me wear his for a day and geez i am in love with these they are the new fisherman shoe too so this should be great

NMD prime knit is all I will wear now Great for wide feet

The NMDare some of the most comfortable and fashionable sneakers out

it is perfect The fit is perfect the quality is great and the price is average Worth the price

Shoe runs a little smaller than other Adi shoes Normally I am a men10 5 but I got an 11 in the NMD Love the Boost midsole for the cushioning Great support for long walks or runs

they are good shoes but after 2 weeks of me having them they are already showing signs of wear and tear with me babying them

Love the shoe Hate the colors will not let me submit until I type more words This is why I do not do these stupid things Why do I need to craft a thesis for a review

Most comfortable shoes I have owned Nice looking shoes Love it

I highly recommend these They are big stylish and comfortable

Comfortable and look great you are able to slip on them on very easily

Came into the store to purchase a pair of Propheres Unfortunately they were out of my size thus resulting in trying these bad boys out Initial input if you posses Ninja Turtle Feet it may be a bit cumbersome putting them on Once you are past that the shoes are out of the way entirely You will not even notice you are wearing them

This show is perfect for working out or wearing for a night out Very easy to slip on and very comfy

Very constable to walk on best purchase ever really lo then

Great product and it feels amazing from the first time you use

Perfect width and quality

these shoes are litt

OKAY TO STARTAmazing shoe Love the look and fit I just wish the quality and build was better especially for the price of the shoe

the sole on the back is a little too protruding but the shoe is very beatiful and comfortable I will give 4 5 overall

Very comfortable and great looking shoeshowever there is no insole support They are too flat Not good for walking a long time They feel more like house slippers

So comfortable and the style is soooo lit I ordered Mens size 6 and it fits perfectly You should get one too before it runs out

Love them this is my first set of NMD I just ordered 2 more sets

I liked cause their are very comfortable and hate very light easy to wear and color is killer in general a great shoes

I love the color way on these I usually wear a women 8 5 but got these in a men 7

The look and comfort is the best Runs a little long

Poor shoe quality Glue waa seeping out the toe cap

I love the sock like feel to them it makes them so light and comfortable

Great deal wonderful fit and very functional for training

Stylish and comfortable My top two reasons for owning a shoe

These STLT PKs are the best NMDs I have ever had It goes with anything I wear very durable and very comfortable

Overall the shoes were very comfortable and I like the colors but felt loose because of the stretchy material that the shoes were made with Overall score 8 10

Very light and comfortable Perfect shoe for the summer

Only thing I do not like is that the picture online the shoes are blacker than in person Other than that they are amazing all around

Wish they ran one size small like all my other primeknits I like the shoe but now I have a pair that are too small for my feet Quality was ok but in some spots espicslly around the toe flap you can see a lot of excess glue

I have notice the latest triple blacks are not selling out that quick anymore ie Pureboost UB NMD etc unless they are one of the colabs I was able to score this NMD the UB clima tho it is called carbon and the pureboost triple black with no issues

These were really wide on me felt like they were flopping around I typically buy a 7 for nmd or ultraboost and have noticed the nmd in general are wider It must be something about this material and maybe that these do not have the cage Unfortunately no 6 5 is available

it is very comfortable it is very stylish I would recommend

Super comfortable perfect fit I am a fan of PK NMDs

Very good shoe ive had it for couple of months easy to keep clean super nice

Order a half size up for better fit since toe area is narrow Still a little snug but hoping will break in Cool shoe nonetheless

Very nice design as well as a very comfortable shoe

The quality is different fr any shoe I have ever worn Boost changed my life so fire

I wish addidas will bring back triple black on black

This shoe is comfortable and it is great use when I am working or traveling

Like all nmd pk shoes they run 1 2 big I followed that rule and ordered a half size down They fit perfect The color is not a true black More of a mesh of grey purple tones with black The inner sock liner has pink stitching that kind of peaks threw when wearing the shoes The new lacing style is a upgrade from the previous flimsy one on the r1 Comfort wise they are ok Standard nmd comfort but I would prefer ultraboost when it comes to perfect comfort Price is a bit high for Nmd but I was sold on the triple black look

The entire NMD line is by far the best shoe line in the market right now Killer style and fit

Adidas really has taken it to a level of comfort the competition will envy for a long long time

Feels good on feet no arch pain at end of day easy to clean and match up

Thinking about getting another pair in another colorthey are that good

Finally found these arrived quickly just what I was hoping for

Very comfortable to wear everywhere and looks good with causal and sporty pants too

I love the boost and the quality of the shoe but most of all the boost

I love the R1and the black on black colorway just makes them look even better If you are getting them just remember to do a half size down and they will fit perfect

My son has had for 2 weeks and the right shoe is ripping on the top near the toe they are not sized too small there is plenty of room

My son wanted these shoes he is very happy with them Comfortable stylish Recommend

Basically I like them for the comfort design and colors

They are veryy comfortable and the style is great

Comfort and style in one Perfect shoe for any occasion

Jdnndbfjsnkwsijncndamkajxjxndnejskoskxjfd sjjdididksnendjnfjsk

very nice on heel but if your looking for toe support you should aim for Adidas Boost

The triple black color way is so fire and the shoes are so comfortable and 170 is a good price for the shoe Godly pair of shoes

We have not had them for 3 weeks and the material they are made of has already pulled and made a hole in them

can not go wrong with this shoes they are extremely comfortable I been waiting for an all black pair I might go ahead and buy a second pair because why NOT

NMDs are my go to sneakers Love the way they fit and feel I have multiple pairs and I am always checking for new color combination to be released Definitely recommend these

I like it and highly recommended it is the good one after Yeezy

Own 5 pairs of the NMD PKnow with these by far being my favorite color selection for the price Normally I need to wear these for about 2 days to get them broken in to my wider feet but these felt great right out of the box 5 5

it is very comfortable this is the first NMD I have and I fell in love with it

Make the all black ones for women too Please I have purchased several of the NMD primeknit but have yet to see all black ones available for women

Comfortable and color great I enjoying them and got lots of compliments

Sneaker fit well but did not like the color in person

This shoe is awesome The shipping went through smoothly and my overall experience was outstanding

I love these shoes Very comfy They feel like you do not have shoes on because they are so light weight The tag irritated my ankles in the back though

it is a good shoe Comfy and everything I just do not like the yellow bottom of the shoe

Dope kicks very comfortable and stylish must have the triple black

Im not a runner anymore but feel these are more for looks Very nice looking shoe

This is a shoe that i like a lot cause the style and comfort and it can go laceles

The Adidas NMD products are my all time favorite Nothing else to say about them they are just really good

Fits true to size Great way to be on trend and as a bonus they are super comfortable

I love the color way and have gotten a lot of compliments on them Just not as comfortable as cs2 or UB

I ordered the last NMDs my normal size 10 1 2 They were too big I ordered these NMDs in 10 and they were too small

Stylish and comfy nmds are the best My only criticism make more

First time owning a pair of Adidas and I love them Everything about NMD R1s are perfect Extremely comfortable so comfortable I bought three pairs

Great job Adidas These sneakers are super comfortable My favorite sneakers right now hands down

Comfortable good looking and light Colors stand out

Value comfort color Found this rare color and was super excited Perfect

iI really like this shoes because it is comfortable and nice looking

I really like these shoes very very comfortable Can really feel the squishiness in the heel and only a little less so in the front which is fine by me I have really wide feet so I ordered a size up and it hugs my foot like a glove even with the bit of space in front Great feeling good quality recommend 10 10

These shoes are very comfortable The boost technology makes it feel like I am stepping on clouds

it is comftorabke but the bars on the boost crease a lot

did not realize the bottom is a pinkish color instead of a red in whic I thought it was

Super cool auntie because he loved the shoes They are comfortable and very light

I bought a pair of r1 from finish line look very neat But extremely uncomfortable First the boost is rock hard it hurts my feet Second there is no support in the shoe your foot is always wiggling around

Love them wear them all the time can not wait to get another pair

This shoe is truly amazing I was scared buying it online cause my feet are wide but it is perfect it feel like you are walking On memory foam Totally love it

I am a girl I wear a size 7 1 2 sometimes an 8 in womens shoes I got a 7 in boys they fit nice but I do have a little wiggle room near my toes so if they came in half sizes I would have ordered a 6 1 2 in men but aside from that I love them

The size chart was accurate and the shoe is extremely comfortable and I love the color

I really liked these Primeknit Zebras they are comfortable when I wear a sock that covers the back of my ankle If I wear a no show sock the tab on the back of the shoe rubs my ankle raw That would be the only design flaw other than that these are some of the most comfortable shoes I have purchased in a long while

Hands down one of my favorite shoes Would highly recommend

My friend said it is the best gift he recievedThe shape the color are all matched with his expect

Great sneaker but if you have wide feet you really need a 5 bigger Overall I would recommend this sneaker

Great shoe looks great in person The primeknit is more vibrant than the pictures

Very comfortable shoes best for running I love it

Very comfortable worth the money spent Definitely would buy another pair

Amazing shoes Adidas never disappointed me You can not go wrong with any Adidas shoes

good quality great sneaker I recommended this to friend

For me this is the best design i hever get from nmd really nice i love the product

These shoes are very comfortable and it took two days for my shipment to arrive I will be making more purchases online

for my grandson and he likes them and that is all that matters to me

Excellent quality and very comfortable and very light

Sleek shoe with a classic look Snug fit because it does not have a tongue May want to look for a half size larger than you usually wear

These shoes run really small Normally I wear a 6 5 or 7 in Youth I had to return for a size 7 5 and my toes still do not have too much space Overall the shoes are comfortable as long as you get the correct size

The shoe is comfortable but it does not let your feet breathe

Very Comfortable laces are much easier to tie on these and do not keep getting loose

I like it because they look sexy and the feel outstanding

This is a very great shoe but i needed to go up to a 12 when I wear a true 11 Great quality shoe and very comfortable

These shoes are very well made and are extremely comfortable As others said I would size down half a size if you can due to these running a little large I can not wait to order more nmds

Nice shoe comfy good summer time shoe need it to get warner to wear

I am blown away by the comfort of these shoes and it looks amazing I see people glancing down whenever I walk by haha

I love it because it is stylish comfortable and overall a high quality shoe

My husband loves it Super light and soft feels like wearing nothing Plus you do not have to tie the shoe laces Highly recommended

Look nice and comfy I would buy this shoes again I give them a 10

I like the look the feel looks good with a Taperrd Jean

Because it is adidas and I love adidas best brand ever

I am size 8 5 in women so I ordered size 7 fits perfectly super comfortable and everyone is complimenting me because they look great Absolutely love them

The back rubber is coming off and scratching after a weekuse

I like the shoe it is very comfortable for all day wear The design pattern is a little loud compared to my normal but I like more and more all the time I have received several compliments on them as well

u202aLove NMDs but the ribbon on the back of these rubs against the back of my ankle which has caused redness and soreness that has not gone away after a week of wearu202c Hopefully this goes away in time because they are great looking shoes only downside is I find it physically challenging to wear them for longer than 30 mins at a time

I bought this in anticipation for a trip to New York I wore them for about 5 days before leaving in an attempt to break them in They worked fantastically even though we walked around 40 miles in three days They are a tiny bit narrow and maybe a little bit small It certainly was not enough to hinder the comfort though They fit about the same as my other adidas I would highly recommend for walking or casual use If you are going to workout in these do not bother just buy a workout shoe

My husband purchased this shoe at an adidas store and fell in love with it So I bought another one diff color for his birthday

Amazing fit Not ultra boost good but that is to be expected but still great looks and comfort

Super comfy Definitely not the last NMD purchase

When I received it I thought it was more of a black color rather than dark brown Please fix the color description Very disappointing But overall it is comfortable If you are looking for black shoes these are not it

Amazing it is the best shoe I have in my collection

Shoes look like they are creased out of the box not cool

it is so comfortable but disappointing that there is no size 6 5

Grandson loves them Fit is good and very comfortable This is his favorite pair of Adidas

Too constricting I bought a pair of nmd last year that I love I have since bought two other pairs and have been disappointed First pair was triple black that they used white thread in so there is a bunch of white visible This pair you have to really work your foot in to get it on over the arch

Amazing look and comfort but really expensive Fits perfectly but again quite pricy

Good

The ones I received were not the same color as the photo they were lighter but still really nice shoes

Super comfortable and looks good with literally everything

Website was easy and made the online ordering experience great They came in a timely manner A very nice shoe Excellent quality

I am addicted to these beautiful comfortable shoe If you are contemplating do not Just buy it it is worth it Wayyy worth it

i do not like how you make me type a 50 character review when i only wanted to say that the shoe is comfortable

I really like this shoes They look amd feel amazing

Cool design and very comfortable The ultraboost soles feel like you are seriously walking on clouds it is crazy

Only my second pair of Adidas First were the amazing Propheres Now these Way comfortable and aesthetically pleasing True to fit as they keep saying Highly recommended

My husband loves these Gets stopped every where we go

I am a size 7 5 womenin most brands so I ordered a 6 in mens and they feel and look great The heel is a tad wide on me and I would like a bit more arch support but besides that I am satisfied with my first nmd purchase

Was looking for a new everyday shoe mostly to go to work with I have heard good things about NMDso I wanted to give them a go and they have completley exceeded my expectations in both style and feel I was expecting a nice looking shoe but after putting them on I feel like these are the best looking ever They also feel nice and comftorable to walk in with an added bonus of being easily able to slip them on

Shoes look clean feel great Get a Lot of compliments

The shoes have a very hard tab at the back of the shoe that digs into your ankle it made my ankle bleed The shoes look great though

They look awesome and feel great Eye catcher for sure

Honestly I do not know why some people say they had to order a 1 2 bigger or smaller size I am size 9 and I always get my correct size on NMD R1 R1 PK CS1 CS2 Ultraboost and Equipment and never had a problem with it I really wanna get a pair of the FUTURECRAFT 4D but they are always sold out

The NMD R1 shoes are stylish and comfortable on my feet

Have many pairs of NMDThese seem to fit a little smaller Not enough for me to change sizes The color looks really good with everything

I had really high expectations and those were not met

Comfortable shoes Quick shipping Overall pleasant experience Would have liked some stickers but whatever

Clean crisp desing and very comfortable Variety of different colorways is great and its a shoe that will never disappoint

The only thing I do not like about the shoe is the band that is at the bottom after the laces I have wide feet so maybe it is just me and other wide footed people experiencing that problem But I still give this shoe 5 stars very comfortable and stylish

The Sizing has changed My first pair of NMDs size 10 are Larger and fit perfectly Lower quality Now

Love the shoe great style great fit very comfortable I definitely recommend it

Extremely comfortable and they look great My second pair of NMDs most likely not my last

This is my third pairs of NMD I really love them They fit perfectly and are really comfortable

They look good and i would recommend for everyone one

it is a very quality shoe probably my only dislike is the fact that the back by the heel tab the shoe rubs against my upper heel and is sometimes uncomfortable

feels amazing

Love the shoe Will start purchasing nmds They are so comfortable

Great quality Good for the price Kind of bland Other than that a great pair of nice sneaks

Buy one half size smaller than normal Overall awesome and really comfy shoes

Fits nicely and is very high quality Great design

I recommend to everyone cause is the best ever shoes a use in my live

They look awesome and feel great I get compliments all the time

Style comfort and durablity These are my favorite shoes

Very comfortable and I can not wait until new styles continue to be released

I ordered the NMD knits and they were at least a size too big so I thought to get these a size down Turns out I needed a size bigger so I returned and ordered a new pair Hoping these workout Would be nice to see more consistent sizing for different styles

Love the color scheme and material they just are too small on me and I wore them already before I could really tell so I am bummed

Super comfortable but its almost a half size too big and the heel tab rubs on the back of my heel and its really irritating other then that its a great shoe

Fit true to size love the color way especially the red bottoms

I guess I am used to primeknit so much that when I purchased these I was expecting them to be somewhat similar But the sizing is just so different than if it were made of PK Too tight around my foot and narrow as well If I were to exchange for a 5 size larger then the length of the shoe would be too long but the width would probably help Sorry but I would not recommend

Just bought them and I got several compliments at the gym I have never owned a shoe that feels quite like this I will definitely be getting more NMDin the future

Amazing comfortable stylish These shoes fit great and are super comfortable

i love nmds the primeknit on these is super nice but the left shoe is noticeably wider and heavier when i put them on that is my only complaint overall happy i purchased

GREAT SNEAKERS FOR EVERYONE TO OWN GREAT FOR SPRING AND SUMMER

I wear a women 8 1 2 and always have to size down on all adidas but when I tried a men 7 equivalent to women 8 1 2 it fit perfect I am glad these fit because I have been looking for a nuetral pair of NMDs and the men colorways seem to be more my speed If you already have boosts do not expect these to have the same level of comfort They are comfortable compared to an average shoe but do not have the same feel as boosts Overall for the look of them they are worth the purchase Also a note to adidas please keep making men 6 5 and 7 for those who actually wear the size and women like me who like the color ways

These are one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn They do not come with an insole so I bought a pair of memory foam insoles and it makes them feel like I am walking on a cloud Definitely a great purchase

Yes i like it but simetime it to hard my size 6 5 or 7 in men

I like it it is so comfortable It is very good product

Exactly what I expected and more Really good shoe especially for the price

I like the product for style of course but mesh

The color of the shoe Boost for foot comfort The materials that make up the shoe

At the same time good on sole

My boyfriend loves them Now I need to get me a pair

good shoe I will be buying more nmds for sure I tend to wear my shoes than to just have them stored

I love this shoe it has amazing color and the black upper feals nice as well as the boost a berry comfortable shoe and decent price point

Is cool and very very very comfortable it fits in my foot perfectly and it is so cushioned and breathable

poorly conceived shoe for running no support and elastic band causes irritation

Not true to size Will return or exchange

Bought a pair of the color staticwhen they released and love how they look I would definitely recommend going a half to full size down though since these run large Also not having an insole makes them feel even bigger I typically wear an 8 8 5 8 in my ultraboosts and ordered an 8 in these They fit fine but I definitely wish I had gone down to a 7 5 The upper PK is super soft and very comfy I found the boost sole in these to be firmer than my ultraboosts which is fine since the NMDs were not designed to run in

The shoes are really narrow and fit small They are comfortable because of the boost The quality was surprisingly low for the price tag as adhesive was on side of shoe

Purchased these for my manValentineDay gifthe was thrilled I read reviews saying the shoes may run a bit small but they fit PERFECTLY The shoes are so clean and crisp plus the design is impeccable Will definitely be purchasing a pair for myself soon

My fianc xc3 xa9 has the worlds flattest widest feet and was never able to find comfortable shoes Not until I bought him the NMDs he absolutely loves it He refuses to wear his other shoes so I went ahead and got him 2 more pair of the NMDs

It is the shoes exactly what I want I like it so much

The shoe is amazingly comfortable Get compliments from everyone one

Very nice style you can dress them up or down They are also so very comfortable

Comfortable Great Quality and really fast service and shipping

This product is extremely comfortable and a great sneaker

This product was hands down one of the best nmds I have ever bought Happy with the purchase

I like the nmd in general because of it is details and comfort Just wish there are more colorways for this But definetly a good purchase

Great shoe and very comfortable to walk around in daily Would recommend

Cool shoes literally and figuratively Comfortable Fit well Go on and off easy like socks I do not even need to tie them The unique look has already received several compliments and people asking about them My favorite NMD R1s so far

I do not know what exactly I expected but it was not what I got I do like the shoes but when I first got them I was kind of thrown off by the hard mesh material and how it outlines your foot while wearing the shoe I also was very disappointed by how the back of the shoe was rubbing against the back of my ankle while walking very uncomfortable and I had to basically tuck my pants in to block the friction I feel like with more wear this problem will go away Overall a decent purchase Fits to size

Highly recommend

I like the product because it is comfortable while working out I have wanted these sneakers for a while and so glad I made the purchase

I do not on this product but I would like to Them shoes be lookin fresh af

Excellent white grey combination with an awesome pattern

I liked these nmd the color is super nice and their really comfortable I recommend these to everyone I am for sure going to buy another pair soon

Super comfortable shoe Takes about a full day of use to feel comfortable but after that you barely feel them They are easy to slip on which makes them quick and easy to put on

Boost looks like fish fish scale This is my 6th r1s and 3 xr1 Not buying anymore nmd r1 coz the boost looks fake

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought

The shoe style wise looks amazing Has a street look and is comfortable Too many shoes out there that have this bulky look and does not go well with the style out there if you know what I mean

My boyfriend loved them and wants another pair lol

I can not believe the shoes i got passed QC The left shoe toe box has a crease fold almost like someone tried to stretch it will be ordering the same pair and will be returning the defective one but still disappointed this passed quality check

I bought these shoes for my son for Christmas He used them for less then a month gently and they are already broken The rubber on the back of the shoe is coming off Not Happy would like to be contacted by someone

Im in love with my nmds And the deliver is really fast too

They are very comfortable and a perfect fit too Perfect to daily wear

Get if you are looking for a casual but comfortable and stylish look because it is just that The boost is amazing

After buying my first pair of Nmds over a year ago i noticed that they are the only shoes that do not hurt my flat feet These shoes are so extremely comfortable and i have never felt my feet ache in these shoes ever I would highly recommend these shoes for anyone male or female as a female i just ordered a size 6 They fit perfect and do come tight at first but after the first wear they fit well Nmds are by far the best shoes i have worn in my whole life

Very comfortable shoe great quality I would absolutely recommend this shoe to anyone who is in the market for a comfortable daily shoe

Shoes are nice and comfortable however they are not black they are a dark greenish color

Great looking shoe But the best part is the fit and comfort

Great shoe looks cool very comfortable Light weight and it is just awesome Fits perfectly

Great shoes Super comfy for work and they look awesome

I have been wanting to get a pair of NMDs for a while and was just waiting for the right colorway to come along And these were it I have wider feet so I was not sure if these would fit me well I usually get a half size up They were a little snug the first time I tried them on but after keeping them on for a little bit and then after a whole day of using them out they now fit great Very comfortable great quality and very stylish

I bought the product a size too small so I sold them for the price I got them for to my friend and he loves them

A hole developed at the front of the shoe My son was playing basketball and his toe slipped through the net after only 30 to 35 days approx

Very comfortable size runs just a tad big Now I am adding this sentence because my review is too short

I liked the quality and the first time I wore it my feet felt very comfortable However the size that I ordered was a bit too small and they ran out of stock of all sizes eventually

First R1 purchase and I am glad i bought this This shoe is so comfortable and feel really light on my feet I am going to be wearing this for a while and I was surprised that the stripes and logo were reflective too

do not like them because they size just a little big

I like the product because it was super comfortable and fit just perfect I would definitely recommend this and buy another pair any day

It is priced well for the quality Would buy a lot more shoes from them

The shoes did not fit me however they are very comfy and stylish

They just perfect for the season they are perfect fit and the quality are perfect

I ordered these shoes because of their unique look and the comfort I have experienced Primeknit NMDs in the past My other pair from last year is so comfortable and easy to put on that they have quickly become my favorite shoes so when I saw these I liked the black heel cap and the funky webbed pattern so much I knew I had to go for them

It is tight when you get the nod but overall a very comfortable shoe

I have a high instep and arch so very few sneakers fit me well These NMDs are awesome They not only fit well they also look great Adidas is bringing the heat

These shoes are purple and gray they are not black like the photos show or as described on the site

Thea are the best shoes I have they are are perfect

The pictures on the site are not really reflective of the color in my opinion These look more brown greenish than black Charcoal is a somewhat ambiguous color description Overall still nice shoes

I did not like the fact that it made my sons feet smells really bad Fist time he has this problem

It feels confromtable when I was running and walking

Not happy with these Adidas sneakers Quality is lacking No QA QC The left shoe and right shoe have dissimilar specs dimensions

Love my nmd typically wear a size 6 women in Nike but in my Nmd I always go down one whole size

it is comfortable but mud and dirt get in the shoes and it is hard to get out

Stay tuned

Quality looked cheap the laces do not go up high enough for them to feel comfortable overall just looked like an off brand of NMDs

Very pleased with the white version I recommend it instead of the black version

I do not have the words to describe how I feel about them

It says the shoe is gray but it is actually brown beware

Extremely comfortable my husband loved his present

I love this product They are so comfortable and look really nice

The third time was the charm they are exactly the ones my son wanted he has worn them every day and that is a high compliment from a teenager

I like the shoe and it looks great very stylish and really comfortable but hard to go with outfits looks best with black pants and shirt

Such an amazing product will definitely purchase more

My 12 yr old son had been looking at these for several months very happy with everything about the shoescool factor size fit quality

I love the fit and feel of these shoes The top mesh is breathable and airy However I usually wear a 10 in Adidas shoes and these were too big I returned and am waiting for the 9 5 to come in To be continued

good shoe but tread seems to wear out fast

The pictures do not show how brown these shoes are They are a great design but I will be returning them Do not order if you are wanting a black shoe

I like it cause it is comfortable and nice looking

I love the color and how they look Super clean design

Love the shoe hate that they came damaged i would love an I damaged pair

Mostly everything perfect but the shoe is a little grey compared to the picture Recommend 1 2 a size down Otherwise great shoe

I bought these shoes for my son and he loves them They fit perfect and look great

The look fit and style are great This was a gift to my son and if it were not limited to only one pair I would have purchased a pair for myself

Love the shoe just very easy to scratch up Very light and comfortable just wish it was made to handle more scratch

The shoe looks very nice on the foot For some reason there is no insole so it kind of lacks support Also the back is a little tall so it may rub you wrong I actually had minimal problems This is a very good purchase all in all

Listened to the reviews are ordered half a size smaller the shoe fit perfectly I thought the shoebox was empty when I first bought them because they are so light the shoe is very stretchy and comfy like a sock so it is very easy to take on and off and the design is very yeezy like Best shoe I have ever bought

I like it a lot although the primeknit variant does get stains easily

My second pair of nmds first primeknit pair Heel hurts after long wear and running Not much support near the front of the shoe

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have I would totally recommend and they go with everything

This is a one of a kind The STLT is an amazing shoe but not as comfortable as the ultraboost But the NMD is for street wear Great Shoe

This shoe is very comfortable and is easy to slip on and go However the back of the shoe has a rubber piece which is now coming of little at a time but I do wear this shoe about 4 times a week Overall its a great shoe just be careful with wear and tear

I like it because it is easy to run in and good price for a shoe at this quality

Great purchase for anyone looking for a light comfortable shoe

Lite and very comfortable Cushioned sole to me good when I am working out

I just love how the shoes feel in my feet and I can wear them all day without any issue

Its all black and has something different about the shoe than the others because of the Japanese lettering

They are good shoes and they look nice The fit is good and the overall quality of the shoes exceed my expectations

AMAZING COMFORT FEEL STYLE BOOST TECH BEST EVER

i would have given them 5 stars but i received them with a big snag on the stripes other than that they are great

Great fit Super light Most comfortable shoe ever

The shoes look more brown than anything unless you have flash or lights on it

I was so disappointed My feet hurt so bad after I tried primeknit shoes and the picture say it all

My boyfriend loved his shoes Great Christmas gift

This show it is nace and comfortable Gets allot of compliments

Amazing shoe Will buy another pair after these are though got the white zebra aka sashiko color Reminds me of the v2 zebras

Great shoe just go down an entire size Very comfortable

Beautiful shoe that fits well You need to buy 1 2 size smaller It does look like brown in certain lightng but still looks nice I have received many great comments about the shoe everytime i wear them

Color description was very misleading shoe was brown Returned them as soon as I got them

Thought they would look more black but that is fine they look great

I have many pairs of Sneakers 50 pairs I like the look of this product

Tennis shoes are different design Love the fit around the ankles

Super easy to wash and clean i love these shoes and they are super comfortable to wear They go with pretty much anything casual and they are easy to slip on and goAt the same time making your outfit still look good

Great quality fabric softy color really nice size runs a little bit to big

Comfortable cool color true to size great for walking

Really did like this shoe it was very comfortable But the color is very deceiving in the product picture I thought the color of these shoes was black but the color is more like a very dark charcoal color

I order them in black and they came in a different color Seems like they are like a faded black

Great Shoes love the quality Gift for my teenage son He loves them Wish they did not come with an Adidas symbol on the outside of shipping the box Ruined my Christmas Surprise

Comfy Very Comfy extremely Comfy Did I mention comfy

This pair is not black it is a DARK brown My son ended up loving them so it is been fine He says they are very comfortable

Unacceptable

Nice looking and good quality Definatly worth the money

The 1 star rating is because of the color of the shoe Shoe quality fit comfort etc is great However the color advertised could not be more misleading Super disappointed

This is Avery comfortable shoe I am and have always been a fan of The NMD shoe And this one is no different Boost is life

Shoes came with a broken shoe lace and after 2 days a hole is starting in the top of the shoe

My grandson said these were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn He loves them They are just a little pricey though

I purchased these shoes for my brother and he loved them

The boost midsole is nowhere near as responsive or soft as something like the ultra boost that being said the primeknit is one of the most comfortable uppers on the market I can wear this shoe all day and not have to much discomfort As far as looks go this shoe very good looking although it will get dirty after the first time you wear it you just kinda have to accept that

bought them for my daughter for Christmas and she loved them

The shoe had no inside sole you can see the stitches and it was very uncomfortable

I bought these for my grandson he put them right on and does not want to take them off It is very hard to find shoes that he likes and these were perfect

Have already three pairs of this shoes Absolutely love them very comfortable and look awesome The quality is not bad like for a mesh sneakers wearing them to work for 2 months and they still look like brand new

RundownI wear a 9 5 on most shoes but a size 9 for these specific pair is perfect for me The shoes are comfortable and fit nice 10 10

Not the same size as my last NMD r1 These ran small

Shoes were way too small got my girlfriends size and her feet went all the way to the end Will be echanging returning

THESE SHOES ARE VERY GOOD AND SO COMFORTABLE GOOD

It was a perfect gift my son said it was his best gift ever

Comfortable and very good quality they fit perfectly and very comfortable

Its a good product and I enjoy the feeling of walking in them

Looked black in pictures but brown in person overall a different look

The shoes are stylish and very comfortable I plan on buying another pair sometime

I like the product Looks comfortable just the size little small

I got these for my brother for Christmas and he loves them he has getting himself a second pair in a different color

This was a gift My granddaughter requested them She was thrilled

Lightweight new style good quality it is unusual without insole The color is not I expect

Great quality Great comfort Great style Great shoe

Love the Shoes I Would recommend them to anyone

It is a good shoemade well too Great color as well

Grandson picky about his shoes so when he said he like his shoes I know he has talking about comfort

These shoes will not last a long time My shoes came in and a week later it had major tears These shoes are over priced and not worth your money

Quality and comfort is the best It does not even feel like you are wearing shoes becomes part of your feet

Really good shoe very comfortable just look a bit yellow

I absolutely love these I am actually a female who usually wears a 9 5 in women so I ordered an 8 and it is perfect They are so comfortable light weight but supportive My first pair of Adidas in years but it is not going to be that way anymore

There is nothing I do not like about this product Very comfortable

Light weight and great quality Great price and fast shipping

I actually love NMD shoes but I was so disappointed at this one They look black in the pictures but in person blahhhh they are dark brown chocolate color They need to state the color of the shoes or take better pictures to show customers the real color

These are not even close to gray These were very much brownish purple I returned them

Very comfortable and very pleased with the shoes One of the best shoes I own

Love the fit of the shoe The toe box is very roomy Just wish it included an insole The boost technology is responsive but the insole would of provided more comfort

Good style and good comfort I would like more colorways

Very Comfy Constant compliments good sense of style

I am a huge fan of nmd This specific color goes with everything I hope adidas keeps bringing back the OG

My friend bought 6 pairs of adidas after he came to US Now I know the reason

Looking at the picture provided and the video you would think your getting a black shoe What you actually get is a weird brownish black color shoe It looks as if it is a very faded black and I am afriad to wear them in the sunlight where I know it will show any more

I like it because I love boost And especially yeezys

Happy I was able to get my hands on these These are even nicer in person

There is no color listed and these are not black

Best quality and style very comfortable and fresh

this is my second pair of NMD and the color is amazing so good you do not know if they are black or brown

The shoes look brown instead of black Misleading pictures on the website

This is my second parent NMDs Fell in love with the style and the comfort of the shoe from my first pair and had to get a second pair in this colorway Most comfortable shoe I ever old

The boost and upper are so comfortable and the shoe looks great

I love how comfortable these shoes are and they look really dope

The adidas Sneaker is very comfortable Looks very stylish at the same time

it is anazing I love it Prrftect fit Need more like this

its pretty unique and rare but needs more production

This shoe is by far the lightest and most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I will definitely purchase these again

I think it is a little more expensive than that shoe should be but I would still buy more of them

Stylish and comfortable kicks for a 14 yr old kid

nice basic shoe that goes with everything you wear

Love this line very light and comfortable Looking to get another pair

They are cute lightweight and super stylish Highly recommend

They looked black on the website but the actual color was nowhere to be found in the description When I received them they were actually chocolate brown so I returned them Please make sure the color is labeled going forward

Love NMDs So surprised when I opened the box and found out these shoes were brown and not black Completely bummed

slightly narrow on width but other than that they are great

I like the design and comfort of the shoe The colorway is also unique

Shoes are comfortable and look great Only down side is that they do not come with insoles

Style good and goes well with a lot of clothes Make your you do not get them dirty hard to get out Just be careful

The color of the shoes nothing like the picture and videos shown on this website the shoe is not a black or like grey like it is the scripted shone very disappointed shoe came back back a dark brown purple color not what I wanted or expected also came with this weird dirty spot on one at the stripes that I can not get off I am a very big fan of Adidas and own alot of adidas shoes but this is one pair I would not recommend

Best shoes most comfortable the color are beautiful easy to clean

it is a unique design and has a great overall feel But I do not suggest these shoes for winter

Go with this color way I own 20 pairs of nmds and have to say this is by far my most favorite r1 Also adidas if your reading this please release yeezys in the 951 you would get more of my hard earned

good good good good good good good good good good good

These shores became my everyday shoe They are so comfortable and light due to the prime knit construction Perfect combo triple black no need to worry about them getting dirty and you can wear them with anything I should have purchased two But got lucky with one Awesome product adidas Keep them coming And those ultraboost XENOS are

Dope kicks overall great for walking and the gym workout

These shoes are very comfortable I highly recomend

A very good looking shoes I love to wear them Effortless to put it on and take it off In my opinion the NMD r1 Prime Knit shoes fit little loose and not comfortable as the NMD r2 Prime Knit shoes

Very comfortable but get dirty very easily Japan Triple White would not suggest wearing them unless you know you will not be walking through any dirt mud

I do not like it becasue the shoes is same size but different size it is very bad

My son loves it I feel it overpriced for a sneaker thats not all leather

I totally recommend getting these shoes They are cool and comfortable Many people have complimented them

I bought these for my husband my 12 year son is his size and when he tried them on he said they were flames and fire he said they were a really good pair and plus I got my son the glitch camo for christmas

My son loves these shoes There comfy stylish and awesome I highly recommend this amazing shoes

you have outdone yourselves yet again excellent in every way

Looks cool and feels comfortable All in all it is the best shoe I have bought

I recommend the White version You will be more satisfied

Shoes are beautiful and comfortable on the sole but the shoes cut my Achilles heel on both ankles Anyone have an idea on how to fix this

I know these were male shoes so I went with a size 5 knowing it would be a little too big Received the shoes and I was right a little too big but nothing a thicker sock can not fix lol they are very comfortable and nice looking so I am keeping it

fits perfectly looks amazing and its trending beats all the overpriced jordans

The shoes are more dark brown than jet black Some people are fine with that but the pictures are misleading and seem to be jet black No I did not receive a defective pair because I have compared with others who have also bought the product

These are my first pair of NMD R1s and I absolutely love them I picked up the white pair with black stripes and I love everything about it can not wait to rock these I would have gotten the black pair but the white stripes just look odd on it

These shoes are NOT black I repeat these shoes are NOT black They are more like very dark purple brown The pictures depict a black and now I realize why they are called Multi color and not black white Disappointed

The shoe is super comfortable Only problem is the black is not a black more like a dark brown Pretty upset about the color

Great shoes that go with a lot of outfits They are comfortable and look very appealing I would reccomend to all my friends

Very comfortable and amazing product Very versatile shoe you can wear with anything

This review is for the black and white ones and they were not what I expected I thought the black would look like it did on the pictures and video but the black is more of a faded color purple

I like it because is was black but I did not not like the white stripes

Love the texture the look and feel Huge NMD guy they are my favorite Adidas shoe Fits perfectlywent TTS

Probably one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn in my life ever

This shoe looks great and feels great just make sure you have a method to clean them

Not good for core workouts as the fabric has to much give

These shoes are great After buying my first pair of nmds I had to go back and buy a second color way so I decided to go with these They look super fresh and the white goes with any outfit The only downsides are that they do get dirty VERY easily so you just have to be super careful with them and I would definitely recommend going down half a size in these Thanks Adidas for always putting out quality products

nmd in general are my favorite shoe ever made but primeknit takes them to a whole new level This is my 3rd pair of NMD primeknits and it is just hard for me to buy anything else Boost completely took the game over too nothing can match the comfort of boost

I highly like the product that I purchased I found the product to be very comfortable especially with the use of primeknit and just wished I could feel more comfort from the boost I slight issue I did have with the product however was the fit runs larger so I would highly suggest going either a half size or even a full size down when purchasing

Love the look it cuts into my bottom calves caused it to bleed on my white shows the first day I had them bummer

super comfortable and light light breathing mesh very soft

I do not like it because it bothers me the back and it hurt me

It was a great and fast shipment and I recommend this to many people

These are beautiful shoes period The problem I encountered is that the sizing is flawed I bought my normal 10 5 because I like a little room in my shoes They were very wide and if I had purchased a 10 my big toe would have been rubbing against the front of the shoe It truly pained me to return these shoesI am sure they will work for most but alas my sneaker slippers must go back

They were great Fit a little snug but that was expected

It is not worth the price Shoes run big make sure to get a 1 2 size smaller

Great shoe and very comfortable i wish they had the black ones on here because i would really like a pair for myself Overal terriffic shoe great product

These shoes are great I would definitely recommend them

cool for a girl to wear menshoes for the first time

The shoe is quite comfortable and the style is bangin

I normally wear a 7 7 5 in women I ended up ordering a 6 because my foot is narrow They fit perfect

The quality of the shoes was sub par and seemed fake

Shoe goes great with almost any outfit Gets Dirty

this shoe is great goes with about anything very comfortable

I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them I read reviews and decided to get a 1 2 size down so that they fit him and they were perfect

My son has had these shoes for less than 2 weeks and they already have a hole in the toe He does not wear them for any sports just to school and around and he has not even worn them everyday What a waste Very poor construction Do not buy these shoes they may look good but you can only wear them a few times

Never have found the NMDto be the most comfortable shoe and purchase would be more for the looks than anything else Definitely not the comfort of an Ultraboost And those the NMD R1 PrimeKnit look cool the upper is pretty flimsy and for me anyway not the most comfortable so returned them Think I can find coolness and comfortability at this price point elsewhere

They are so beautiful and so light im in love with my nmds

I like the product because they are very comfortable and great looking shoes

Triple black comfort stylish sneaker on your foot

I like it because its fashionable and comfortable but its not true to size

Super comfortable just make sure you order down on the size

The bottom of the shoe rips off easily and the top turns blue when you wear jeans

As an avid buyer of your shoes you can never go wrong with an NMD Durable comfortable light weight Plus the color ways and the aesthetics of the shoe are daddy Keep bringing the heat

After reading the reviews we ordered a half size smaller And the fit was perfect My son loves these shoes so much and makes me spot clean them daily

It is very comfortable and fits my foot almost just right

Adidas has done it again This is one of the dopest colorways I have seen for the NMDs Thank you adidas

My husband purchased these shoes for me and I love them very comfortable and has a very nice look They were expensive but who cares as long as the make my feet feel good I am all in Thank you nmd R1 primeknit

I live the style look The all white is clean These catch people attention from what I have noticed

I bought these shoes thinking they would look really cool They are totally comfortable and are super cushiony on my feet The only problem is that the elastic band part around the top of my right shoe is totally tearing apart my Achilles tendon and i got blood right next to the loop in back Not sure if this is a defect since the left shoe does not hurt at all These shoes also get dirty really easily if you get them in the white like I did

This shoe is mad cozy yo they do run a bit large so I would go a half size down I wear 11 5 12 and got an 11 and they are perfect but overall great shoe great quality must cop

I really love these shoes they are super comfortable and very easy to take on and off I love the Japanese pk nmd

These shoes are so comfortable They are great I have four pairs The patterns are awesome I am a girl and bought a size 5 they are a little big but they are too comfy to give back

First of all liked the shoe because it is super confortable

Good shoe fits great very comfortable I like good to workout in

I loved the shoe but the 10 5 feels like an 11 or 11 5 so I would have to downsize Which I think I am going to

Liked it so much bought another pair Very comfortable and looks great

Love color way Hate how easily they get dirty Super simple to wash

The shoe runs big so get half a size to a size smaller but by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever put in my feet 10 10

it is light and comfortable Very good for everyday wear or to the gym

Just the overall feel and look of the shoe is tough to beat

I really like this shoe but it is really difficult keeping it clean it attracts dirt like mosquitos to a well especially around the top and on the side where the three stripes are the outline of them it is hard to tell by just glancing at them You can really only tell if you try to look for them and it is kinda hard getting rid of the stains

I am extremely satisfied with my purchase I am amazed in the effort put in to making them in designing them they are extremely comfortable and look amazing They do come a half size too big though so order a half size lower Even through that I am extremely impressed and satisfied with the issues and I would recommend them to anyone who wants great quality

I was looking for an all white shoe and this fit perfectly

From my experience it is one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn

I am already a fan of R1When these came out with the sashiko design I had to have them Aaaand they were PKIt was a no brainer They are comfortable as they are beautiful Need I say more

Received sneakers with 1 Adidas stripe not glued to sneaker Very disappointed with Adidas

So comfortable it is like walking around in socks

I really like the NMD R1 Primeknit but it has a flaw the back tab scratches my heel I really wish they could change the material for the back tab strip but they are still pretty awesome shoes

I liked them they look amazing Feel amazing and my friends love them

Very comfortable and stylish shoes Light weight shoes that can be easily put on plus it feels like if you do not have any shoes on at all

Definitely recommend this product Very comfortable and Quality

I like the shoes the only problem I had was that they came a bit dirty from the bottom and top

I love the shoe but for a kid like me I have worn them twice and they are already stained I have to be cautious

I love the style the fit and they are soft and light THE BEST PAIR OF KNIT SHOES I have OWNED

Comfortable stylish and true to size A bit expensive though which is reason for 4 stars

This was a gift but from what I hear these were super

All black with the black boost this sneaker is very very CLEAN

Great shoe wish Adidas will do more black sole on the boost

These shoes are amazing extremely comfortable and they definitely stand out 10 10

Looks and feels great So happy they restocked this product

Perfect size great style = perfect shoe Lolololo

Highly recommended NMDs are the most comfortable shoes I have If you have flat and wide feet as myself Go TTT

The shoe itself is a good looking shoe but the sizing is way too big

Pretty good shoe Comfortable but very thin cloth

My son love them They fit him perfect he is a 5 5 in kids I purchased the size 5 and they fit perfect

I have been wanting adidas for awhile now and finally got something that suits me

The shoes are sick they are so cool i get so many complaments No one has these kind i love everything exept for one thing no pair of shoes are worth 180 there made in china but there so cool i bought them and i would again as long as i do not pay thx mom well thatas my review i would buy them very nice and over all quality shoes

I really like these shoes the overall design is flashy but very nice

Great shoes very comfortable And very clean look Easy to put on Very easy to clean and keep them clean Shoe make more nmd Japanese editions

This is my first NMD so I did not know what to expect The back tag can be quite bothersome to the ankle if you wear low socks but aside from that the product fits and looks great

Amazing product Very good price and comforts Perfection is 100

These shoes provide so much comfort for my feet It feels like I am walking on clouds

It looks amazing but the size a little big so I recommend one size smaller

The thing that I did not liked was that it gets dirty fast so I am only wearing them 3 times a month

Great stuff feels great it is like walking on a cloud while being hugged

I like these NMD specifically cause they go great with many of my outfits and they look fantastic

I suggest going half a size down because they do fit a little big but other than that the shoes are both comfortable and stylish

I liked it because it was a unique looking shoe that definitively stood out from the others

I have ten pairs though I do not like white shoes these have the perfect Oreo type of balance there is nothing like the Primeknit NMDs

Very comfortable fits well looks very clean Love them

Shoes are half size big but overall are extremely comfortable

need to make more of the black on black on black NMD R1 Primeknit Shoes

Thanks for having the smaller sizes in stock Awesome Adidas shoes as always

The product is amazing These shoes will last a long time if you do not wear them to play sports My friend tried them on and he is a size too large for them but they still fit because of the primeknit This will last a while

Not only do they look awesome they are super comfortable Get yourself a pair

just the over all shoe it is nice comfortable and it looks good

my shoe size is 9 5 but these run a bit large so you i got a 9 and fits perfect You might want to go 0 5 a shoe size down

They are very good looking shoes and a goos pattern but weal quality

I like the way these sneakers look but they are hard to keep clean even with the protection spray

it is comfy but you need to take care of them to keep them fresh

Style and comfort is very good I reccomend to buy on adidas not any other retailers usually cheaper

The back heel tab constantly rubs up on my heel and hurts a lot Any fixes

It makes my son happy He wanted them super bad The online service was incredible

Because it has a good shoe design and very comfortable

PRIMEKNIT runs 1 2 size large order accordingly Love the pattern print Shoes are insanely light the boost is real So far they are great

It runs half size larger so make sure you buy 0 5 lower Looks great Good Quality

I like it bc it comfortable It a nice style It feel like im walking in socks

So comfortable Light yet almost hugs your foot The primeknit allows air to circulate so your feet get a breeze Great fit plenty of roomI even had space for an orthopedic insole on top of the ultraboost sole

I love how is look but i think It 1 size bigger than ultraboost

The shoes are very comfortable and stylish Perfect for daily wear and exercise

Fire just fire

Very good shoe comfortable flyknit is great look stunning

Love the primeknit stitching comfort and durability of the NMDLove LOVE LOVE these shoes

it is very comfortable and get so much attention I love it my go to everyday show

great shoe to wear Always look dope with all outfits

Best looking shoe and really comfortable I recommend stylish too

Slip on sneaker Very light in weight Excellent quality Happy son here

You should buy this product because not most people have them

Awesome shoe Really like the look and feel Lots of compliments

Like because the quality is great for what I paid for

The product is super comfy and looks good on feet there hyped

These shoes I bought more so to add to my collection of NMDs Unfortunately when they arrived and I tried them on they felt very big The PrimeKnit shoes seem to run a bit larger than all my other NMDs this was the case with my Japans I received the same week The design was not as nice in person as it looked online but they are still very well designed The PK around the ankle is really comfortable but being the whole shoe is PK it makes it feel like an oversized sock Overall great shoe but I do wish I got the black sashiko instead of the white Recommend a half size down on Primeknits

My first pair of NMDThey are so comfortable I went down half a size but believe I could have gone a full size and still been good Got plenty of compliments the first time I wore them looking forward to future NMD styles and color ways

My girlfriend bought me these shoes for our anniversary and although they are on the more expensive side I must say they are one of the greatest pairs of shoes I have ever worn The ultraboost is super comfortable and the primeknit technology makes it very flexible and fit well The japanese on it add a nice touch of flair to an already sleek shoe

Very comfortable just like any other pk nmdRun a little big I would prolly go a 1 2 size down

Great design in all black very desirable NMDMake sure to keep these clean

These shoes are good quality but I returned them because they are not my style

I am in love with the shoes but however you should probably go a half size down due to this material being super stretchy I went true to size and they are definitely a little big

These shoes are a perfect combo of style I love these shoes because they earn you respect and draw eyes in public

Comfortable and very easy to put on and easy to take off

Primeknit is very soft shoe fits kinda large probably should go 1 2 size down if you like a snug fit the heel pice digs into the back of the leg

Very cool shoes just run way too large Had to return mine for a 0 5 smaller size Hope that one fits well

There perfect in the sizing and there comfortable and the stand out and get attention so there is nothing else I could ask for

it is hypebeast dope and super comfortable Price is a little high but the primeknit is worth the extra cash

The upper is too flimsy PK is not as good as the Ultra Boost PK Spend the extra and buy Ultra Boost NMDs are not worth it

The product is very ugly and I thought it would look better

I do not like that they are not easy to clean they got dirty very quickly and I purchased Jason Marx cleaner and even that does not get clean Will never buy white again

Putting this puppy on is like putting on a sock but the sock is a shoe Super comfortable and super stylish All the kids at school felt envy for my hip new shoes Would recommend

The all white NMD R1 did not fit well unlike the black white ones I ordered I regret wearing them once as I may not be able to return them

Love my addidas they are amazing comfortable and stylish

Good purchase but with no show socks it makes your heel hurt

I really love this shoe and really recommend this shoe As a college student it is important to not only find a shoe that is comfortable but also stylish I can wear this between classes and when going out with friends Really happy with this purchase

I like the style and the the way it fits on my feet I have wide feet so not a lot of shoes fit comfortable

I love the sock like construction especially the white knit aopearance and sole design

Soft on the feet and cool style Well balance shoes

Comfort and style is perfect Tripple black is the colorway that I want to have

I will stick with vapormax I really hoped these would live up to the hype but as usual it is all just that hype

it is style and grace Plus the comfort that it brings to my feet is just amazing I love them Thank you so much Adidas you did it againAllIn

Quality was poor and the sizing was off Not worth such a high price for the quality you are getting

I can be wearing the shoes all day and not have any foot pain Very comfortable with nice styling

I love this shoe The only problem I have is that I should have ordered a size down but unfortunately the smallest size is a 7 Regardless the shoes look awesome and they feel great

This is a classic adidas shoe with a new design that looks and feels awesome

Nice look feels great Get lots of compliments every time I wear them

Go half a size down a great shoe on feet and very comfortable

I usually wear a US11 but saw recommendations to go down a 1 2 size for PK and they were right The shoes are super comfortable and light I have the R1 and R2 so the next will definitely have to be an Ultra boost

That was all black need an ultra boost now

Great fit and great comfort Exactly what I expected it to be

I know people were hating on these for whatever reason These babies are one of those shoes that you have to see in person They are absolute fire on feet They are in my weekly rotation and I love busting them out The PK on these are so comfy they feel better than the PK on my UB3 0 Must Cop

shoes run much bigger than i thought i do not know if i will be able to wear these shoes without feeling uncomfortable about how large they are

I wear orthotics because I have a flat footed shoe but I usually do not wear them with boost shoes but the NMDdo not have an insole so I tried it on When I wore the shoes with my orthotic the back of the shoe rubbed against my heel and when I took the heel off the block hit against the inside of my shoe Other than that amazing shoe boost makes it comfortable and the design is by far the best looking out of all the NMD r1 

The shoes was extremely comfortable and I do not think I will ever be able to not walk on BOOST again but the package the box came in and the shoe box were both in extremely bad quality so that was sad but the shoe was undamaged

Super happy how these look on feet The knit feels extra smooth and soft

it is a very good shoe that looks very nice and is not WAY too overpriced I would not buy if your tight on money I personally have very wide feet and this shoe fits perfectly for me and my friends with regular feet

I will keep buying PK NMDComfort is great and the PK on these is top notch

love the style and comfort of the NMD and Boost line

I swear ordering on the Adidas website is the easiest thing ever Just as long as you have a good internet connection you are golden

The shoe is a really clean and high quality shoe It does get dirty really quickly i recommend crepe protect shoe spray but it is definitely worth it Also very comfortable

Boost has taken over And Primeknit only doubles the comfort Triple black in boost and Primeknit is a must for any collection

I love NMD but i wish they would implement a insole for this model

Amazing buy if you could snag it for retail the only reoccurring disappointment is that the heel counter on all r1is easily scratched And leaves shiny streaks which make it hard to sell when they are used

I love the shoes and they look so nice but they are kinda pricey

The fabric seemed a little stretched that may just be me Otherwise these shoes are great

Overall I love this shoe and I am glad that I bought it The only small gripe that I have is that the glue is very noticeable on the all black materials The glue stands out between the boost sole and the primeknit as well as around the entire edge of each stripe on the side This visibility makes it look much cheaper than it should Aside from that the shoe looks great and I love it

I returned the shoe because it was sized too large even inconsistent with the black version sizing and also because the whites were unlike the photo The boost sole stripes and toe cap lining were all slightly yellow off white compared to the pure white primeknit and it did not look good

Glue everywhere on the shoe Otherwise pretty good

Another roast material to use when trying to flexx

After owning a pair of Ultraboost I wanted a triple black pair of Adidas I tried to grab a pair of the recently released Triple Black Ultraboost but they were sold out in minutes I really liked the style of the NMD but never owned a pair and even though they do not have as much cushioning I decided to give them a try Yes this is my first pair of NMDs Here are my thoughts 

Simply a size issue I think it is a cool product but it is not for me

Love how it goes with any outfit while keeping me comfortable all day Perfect

These shoes are beyond comfortable and the NMD R1 style is clean and classy

I a size 6 1 2 in womens size 5 in mens is just perfect

it is nice silhouette but to much glue stain and floss

It looks really good and is well over comfortable

great shoe wish it was a bit wider other than that amazing

Comfortable Stylish Eye catching I love the white but wish I would have got the black also

Very well made primeknit feels great and is it just me or do these feel like they have more boost than the other R1sI would say they are overpriced though

All white and super clean sneaker Primeknit material is soft comfortable

These shoes are comfortable and are definitely worth buying

Slick look and comfortablity Something you can use while wearing shorts anything in general

delivery time was great

I loved the product great fit and great looking If I could discribe the shoe it would be near perfection The style of the shoe works great with every outfit the colors popped and comfort level is above the charts In my opinion this shoe is a 10 out of 10 Adidas much love and keep coming out with awesome products

The shoes are very comfy only issue there are inconsistencies in the prime knit mesh Definitely a quality control issue

I love the sneaker because it is comfortable and It is really nice This is my first purchase of an adidas nmd and I agree with everyone else it is the best adidas sneaker I have worn ever

My son tore a hole in the toe the first week he wore them Hate to spend that much money and have them tear up that fast NOT FOR KIDS

Been wearing NMDfor while and this product sure is going to make me keep buying more

It one of the most comfortable shoe i own and i would recommend this shoe to everyone

The shoe design is great it feels well Delivered within 3 business days

Everybody loves them and there the most comfortable shoes I ever owned

I already knew NMDs run big so i half sized down but it was still pretty big Shouldve full sized down

Comfort is the key and it is perfect for the weather

The shoes are killer Copped two pair One of the shoes had a slight catch in the primeknit but they are still awesome shoes

Would definitely recommend these Go a full size down they run super large Probably my favorite sneaker ever as far as esthetics are concerned



Because it is stylish comfortable and air matches with everything

Okay quality that is it

Being able to secure a pair is worth the anticipation They are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever wornnot to mention how great the look Very satisfied with my purchase and cannot wait to purchase others

Clean comfortable and overall amazing My second pair of NMDand its safe to say I will be buying more

The material and quality of shoes were nice They fit perfectly

Best pair of shoes I have but I wished I coped the black ones if you see this adidas hook me up with a free pair

it is a beautiful product the quality and hype was matched and beyond expectations

Overall the shoe is comfortable and stylish

I like the shoe a lot However the glue stains throw me off a bit and take away from the overall quality of the shoe

material is easy to stain needs Better weather protection for a longer lasting fresh look Like it a lot KEEP UP THE GOOD LOOKS Thanks for your time

Honestly I really wanted the black version of these but I was unlucky I felt like returning the white NMDs as soon as I bought them online However after receiving them and trying them on I completely changed my mind These are really comfortable I am a TTS 8 in Adidas and these run slightly big but I inserted an insole from my EQT ADV and they are perfect The only issue is that my toes show a bit more but I do not really mind Without insoles TTS is roomy but not too roomy and probably perfect for people with wide feet Half size down for a perfect fit if you do not have want to add insoles Also make sure you get Crep protect or some shoe cleaner kit to maintain the white I love Adidas and NMD is one of my favorites

very comfortable and fits like a glove in my feet i will certainly recommend it to my friends

I love everything about this show it is so confortable

Comfy and stylish all at once These are sure to make a good impression

Most comfortable sneakers I have wear them all day and my feet thank me

By far one of the nicest shoes in my NMD collection It stands out in the crowd and they are breathable and comfortable Always get compliments and the occasional head turn and the elevator eyes straight down to the shoes

adidas never dissapoints me will always stay true to the brand with the 3 stripes

I like it because it is comfortable and looks nice

it is the most comfortable shoes i ever wore and now I was another one but all black they are sold out or I would have gotten black and white

I bought these knowing my size in womenbeing a 7 5 so I got them in men6 and it was the perfect fit I was a little nervous because it is hard to tell sizing but LORD they fit like a glove and feel AMAZING The qualitiy of the shoe is top notch and the color looks so rad

Very lightweight and is comfortable Looks great and icyyy

They are great shoes I always love boosts because when I wear them it feels like I am walking on a cloud These NMDs are awesome my only hesitation in saying that is they are a bit chunkier than they looked online The boost just needs to be a little smaller still bigger than the primeknit on top but smaller than it is currently Bottom line my one small complaint is that it looks a little chunky for nmd are 1s other than that perfect

Comfortable Not so sure on the quality YET Size runs half small if your a 9 5

The comfort and design is exceptional This color way is great because it will be hard to get them dirty if worn daily Also the Japanese branding on the midsole blocks is what sets these above the rest Overall a beautiful shoe

The best nonconsortium NMD Like all NMD R1 pk go half to a full size down they fit big

Clean cut style and modern design melded into one unique shoe I am a real minimalist when it comes to my shoes and when I saw the triple black were sold out I was not worried about missing on it since the triple white looked just as good An amazing fit Great shoe for lounging around An overall must have for the collection

most comfortable and stylish shoe I have ever used

NMD R1 PK shoes are quite possibly the most comfortable shoe out there I have 2 other pairs of NMDs but this triple black pair is now my favorite

I like this release NMDs in general are not very comfortable for me though the brick on the inside of the shoe digs into my foot i do not get why they do not put an insole in these either people say to go a half size down in these but i wear tts going down half a size is a little tight and you can see my toe popping through so id recommend to try these on before buying and see what size works for you

For the quality of the shoes the price is worth it

it is a very comfortable yet stylish sneaker For any occasion

The size is perfect it is just that my heel got a blister after half a day of use

Best of all really comfortable comparable to the ultra boosts First time buying a primeknit shoe and they Do not disappoint

I like this shoe because it is comfortable and stylish and that is a great combo to me

The product is too bulky and uncomfortable Also they run really big So get a half size smaller than what you would wear They are not like the first NMD 

Quality of PK is great Shoe is comfortable Great

I am in loooooooooooooooooove with my mnd r1 japan I love it

my 3rd and favorite pair of NMDs They run a half size big but the primeknit will stretch out and eventually the shoes fit just like a sock 10 10

I Love the black boost super comfortable also love the all black color

They are absolutely perfect in style and comfort triple black boost is so stylish

The sneaker is great and comfotable but boost is not awesome

It is comfortable and as a sneaker collector this is a good pair to have just to wear

Great shoe would 10 10 recommend but it runs big Go half a size down so it fits I am a 9 5 and got that but it did not fit so I just put my insoles from my yeezys in it and it fit

High quality material comfortable easy to slip on

Quality is terrible Shoe would be great if you could step up your quality control Glue was everywhere and seeping out of all seams

Had to order a half size smaller But love the all white NMD

Superb could not ask for more comfort or simplicity

Love the triple black colorway PK is especially soft on this nmd Yet it feels narrower than other R1Maybe my feet are just too wide

I like the product because its comfotable to wear it

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life

It goes with EVERYTHING you can not really go wrong with any NMDs

it is comfortable and a good winter shoe Reasonable price for a cool pair

Feel great on my feet and they look super awesome

Great shoe really comfortable and stylish Would def recommend

Great shoe Awesome materials could not be happier with this

IMO but I like the subtle nature of the shoes I wear them more than my other primeknits for that reason

Super comfortable and best shoes i ever had

The shoe was much more comfortable than i thought it would be

ive actually been against adidas shoes forever My first adidas purchase was a pair of nmds and I can not stop buying them now

Great shoes fit a little big but still a great purchase

These look good and are super comfortable Love the Japanese writing too

Runs a lil large Very comfortable shoe Very stylish

One of the most comfy shoes I have ever purchase Quality is second to none

Because it so comfortable especially with the boost the price is worth it

The PK NMD is amazing but it still seems to be too big

Love it Normally sz 7 5 needed 6 5 bought 7 Overall Beautiful

the color way is on point the triple black is always the best the simple japan accent is on point

They are a clean colorway and are pretty comfortable but for the price I would bought a pair of ultraboost or vapormax

Excellent texture with a perfect feel that I would not change for anyPK is the choice and should be the only of any shoe amd design and always with the boost option as wellmore vibrant colors like the NYC Apple Red PK NMD should be mlre available as well such as the sun orange and such with jewel colors that I have listed before amazing fashion shoes

Great shoes and design I love them Would definitely buy more from adidas

I love the comfort of it And the shoes look so classy and I feel they will make any outfit look incredible

Probably one of the best models as a daily beater but be aware that you must Sz a 1 2 down or a full Sz in my opinion

AMAZING best shoes I ever bought fits perfect and looks great

Comfort and Quality And hands down great design

I like the primeknit it is very comfortable but I am usually a size 11 and when these came in they look and feel a size bigger but inside the shoe it says size 11

The boost is just so amazing If you want comfort nmds are for you

This is a great shoe Very comfortable and very nice

Awesome and the most comfortable shoes in nmd product line

Since I was introduced to NMDthey have been my go to sneakers They are so comfortable and go with everything

Real comfortable for daily use perfect love them

lucky enough to purchase these and very pleased with them

This is the best sneaker I favor of all I were them daily This is my 5th pair and will continue to purchase them

My son says this shoe is Very comfortable However he had to return his first pair due to they run very large He are ordered a whole size smaller and they fit great

Recommend getting a half size smaller but overall is a nice shoe Wish I could have got the black

Perfect summer shoe and the Japanease writing makes it look very exclusive I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a super clean versatile sneaker

Favorite pair of NMDs and I have a lot of them These are amazing

Love the comfort and the style of the shoe Can go with anything and looks good

So incrediblely comfortable Hard to keep clean but easy to clean up

I love it Looks good Very comfortable i wear it everyday

NMD R1 PK is my go to work out shoe The comfort and lightweight durability relieves a lot of pressure on my feet Not to mention looking dope in the gym

I like the PrimeKnit material already but the NMD with primeknit is crazy good combination

In love this shoes comfort style and price I would definitely buy this kind again

I been waiting for Adidas to drop these since run dmc in 85

There was a defect with the shoe I received it partially rippedthe part where the shoe laces connect to the shoe was not stitched on properly and if it was it ripped prior to Mr receiving them Disappointed

it is comfortable just upset how the back strip of the nmd is random every time I except the shoe to have all japan writing on it Overall great shows

Best shoes I have ever bought so comfortable feel like your walking on clouds

Compared to the mesh nmds these primeknits fit me a half size too big

Super clean look Got one for the husband and myself Love this one The only thing I would say is the fabric seems a little harder to clean so kind of bummed out about that Other than that super nice looking

Looks design and comfort can not get enough NMDs Need another pair pronto

Free shipping and arrives quickly being able to track your package is vital

Very comfortable and lightweight and most importantly it is very Fresh

it is a really clean and classic look I sized down 1 2 from my normal Adidas size for a perfect snug fit Normal Adidas size would work fine but they felt just a bit loose around the heel for me The only reason I do not recommend these is because I do not want to decrease my chances of getting future limited releases Black Boost looks great more please

Black Boost Primeknit NMD can not beat it period

Perfect triple black combination with comfortable Prime Knit material

Very comfortable shoe and recommend them to people

2nd to none in comfort and looks Absolutely love them

I like it it suits me a lot I do not think I will find anything like this

it is like you are walking on a cloud love the style

I Highly recommend this product 0 5 size down IMO

The primeknit is totally worth it Super light and breathable The boost was not as comfortable as I wanted it to be but still pretty good You should definitely buy these

Second favorite sneaker comfort wise after the ultraboost but astetics this shoe looks super clean

it is Adidas NMD what not to like One of the best shoes

The shoes got here super fast which is great too big but nice

it is one of the best looking nmdout there do yourself a favor a figure out how to get a pair of these

Colorway pk boost can not get much better than that

Because is different but simple at the same time

The Style gives it a nice flare to the usual office outfit and the comfort level makes my feet very happy

Subtle colors but loud statement Just like me haha

Great style Very comfortable Triple black on NMDs are prefect colorway Great job Adidas

Adidas got the good stuff should grab these before they gone forever

I got lucky getting a pair of these on release Definitely did not think I would be able to snag a pair Prime knit upper is nice it stretches so you can probably order a half size down from normal I am 11 5 with my nmd r2s dame3 ultraboost STs and crazy explosive 2017s I think 11 for this model would fit just fine

What more can I say about this fine piece that you can see Fits perfectly Comfortable like no other And finally the NMD size stays true to the size chart The best shoes out now

Very comfortable and great colorway would recommend

Great shoes but if you have higher aches there is nothing to the shoes but for short trips there great and just slip on and go

Very confortable awesome shoes this color is unique

Big fan of the NMD and usually like the colored blocks but the pattern on the upper gives these shoes just enough flash for me Primeknit is super comfy but definitely go down a size

Hype beast and love the triple black and it is comfy

This is my first pair of NMD and while I love the look and style especially the black boost midsole and primeknit upper I was slightly unimpressed with the insert or lack of one Consequently this has a direct effect on the comfort for long wear I can not see myself using these in place of Ultraboosts for a long day on my feet However despite this critique I am very happy with this purchase

The might not look the best in the picture but once you get them it is magical

This shoe is extremely comfortable it feels like a sock with a sole on the bottom and is extremely light but go a half size down

Shoe is perfect Black on black nmd is always good

I love the shoes they are overall great nice comfort beautiful white but the only issue with mine was there was a defect

Fits tts and gets a lot of heads turning People will as about them

Such a dope shoes best NMD color way I have ever bought Very stylish already picked up a second pair

Top notch comfort and never been criticized on my style while wearing them

its first all black sneaker that do not looklike a lunch lady shoe it sharp

I went half a size down and they fit like a glove such a nice lightweight construction and the inner support is just right

I have been a fan of the NMDfor a while and when they realized these I had to get my hands on them I love them all though I feel like when the released these they should have done a restock of the Tokyo Blacks

too big so I returned and size smaller is sold out

Clean NMD with a nice design and comfortable to wear

Will you guys restock the triple black versions of these I am dying to get some but there all sold out and they have been sold out for a while

These shoes are awesome I love the pk design and the comfort is amazing

Shoes are beautiful but there is an error small molding error on right shoes boost sole They are just too big can not return them for correct size as they are sold out of the size I needgtlt 

I liked them better then the black but the back tab is annoying with pants

This is a great shoe Very comfortable and could wear them all day great school shoes Would definitely recommend going half a size down from True size

This is my fourth pair of NMDs By far my favorite shoe I love the style especially the Japanese inspired upper I love how Adidas has cultural inspired products Boost is amazing The shoe fits perfect R1s and Xr1s are the widest pair of NMDs but still fit perfectly with prime knit keeping the shoe snug The most comfortable stylish shoe on the market by far Great job adidas

I order it twice to get the right size but I like it a lot

The NMD R1 PKhave both a fashionable stylistic look and a comfortable texture to evenly balance the perfection of beauty and feel An Onix slated gray and jewel light purple is needed for the next NMD R1 PK as soon as possible

I like the product a lot because it is such a conformation and good looking shoe

They are great zebra shoes I like how the insole feels under your feet

because it looks amazing

Great shoe just hard to very keep clean

Amazing look and quality If it was true to size would definitely be 10 10 product

Boost is hard but primeknit is really comfortable A half size down when you are purchasing

I love this product because i love it and really good quility

I loved it because it made me feel like I am walking on a cloud of comfort The only problem i have with it is that the pull tab at the back often rubs off on the back of my foot and is a little annoying other than that it is perfect

These shoes are extremely comfortable and have a very unique look compared to other triple black shoes The kanji on the sides really adds a coolness to the shoes I watched reviews on the sizing of Primeknit shoes and you definitely should go 1 2 a size down

I really like these shoes They look amazing and the are so light and comfortable They are about a half size too big but I still enjoy them

The product is created to fit like a sock and is really comfturble I love the color way can not wait to see more colors

A bit bitter that the shoe ran larger than expected and I can not buy a lower size because size 5 is not available Maybe one day I will have Adidas that fit Today is not the day

My only complaint is that I am a 10 1 2 but I had to get them a size 10

So comfortable and perfect with most outfits not so durable on the toe Order a size smaller that you usually wear

no back pains no calf pains wearing them all daylots of walking in LA

Although not as comfortable as the Ultraboosts the comfort is still there They run half a size big so size down Just as stylish but the Japanese emphasis makes it a great touch

im a huge sneaker head i have owned countless lebrons and jordans today i saw these and i instantly asked if they had my size these shoes are probably going to make me switch to adidas how ever i wish they still sold the matching hoodie that came with these shoes back in 2015

The shoes are comfortable and durable Size half a size to big

These are extremely comfortable shoes probably some of the best The white is a little hard to keep clean but they are defiantly worth the buy

Really comfortable and they look really good goes with about any outfit as well

I really like the shoe because of its looks and the way they feel

Perfect pair for everyday Super comfortable and fits well

I like the style comfortable to wear The price is fair

This NMD provides so much comfort that I could wear them all day On top of that their stylish and perfect for back to school All white goes with everything but boost and the Japanese accents makes this shoe so much better than it already is

So comfortable and looks so nice I am so lucky got one for myself and my husband Best purchase ever

i cop shoe from adidas com without failme like

Its super comfortable sneakers ever i would recommend it to all my friends

I love this product because I have all day comfort while dabbing on the haters

I am a simple man I make cgi robots fight these are amazing

I love them I own about 8 nmd pairs

love the style and i love the boost They are verry comfortable and

Because I love it and the nmd r1 pt are the best so you guys have to buy a pair

great cosmetics and fantastic feel I would definitely recommend these shoes for all purposes

You can not rly feel the boost Otherwise it is a great shoe runs a lil big but still fits great

its so comfortable and they do not get dirty very easily and they are the best pair of shoes i have purchased

A big fan of boost and Adidas PK These NMDs do not disappoint and the colorway is very easy to style Easy cop but they do run a 1 2 size big I always go down 1 2 a size whenever I buy PK NMDs

They were not the right size for me I am usually a 13 but I needed a 12 or 12 5

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Keep killing it adidas

Comfortable light material I will recommend my friends to try adidas next time

I like the comfort of the shoe the quality and the weight of the shoe I do wish that I knew that they run a halfinch larger Unfortunately they are no longer available so I can not exchange

A really awesome colorway on the NMD r1one of my favorite for sure

These are fire But I had to return it bc the mesh tab was rubbing against my upper heal Weirdly it was only the left shoe that was doing this

I didnt like how the shoes size is too big a size 10 fits like a size 11

Pretty common Knowledge that NMDs run a half size big go a half size down and they are AMAZING

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Great Great Great One thing to keep in mind is that you need to size down They run big

it is hype and ok quality great shoe very hype I am hypebeast

Now use them in the gym all the time

Very light and comfy sleek street style for the summer

they are really comfortable shoes and should be in everyonewardrobe The colourway is really nice and matches with practically anything

I wear 7 5 for ultra boosts and 7 for any other adidas sneakers and 7 fits just right for me with insoles I have narrow feet Remember NMDs do not come with insoles so to get most comfort you would have to insert a pair They feel softer compared to Ultra Boosts However for longer walks and runs I would recommend Ultra Boosts as they have more support NMDs just look prettier These especially look really good and go well with pretty much any outfits

So comfy and great for Wide Flat feet You can make the shoe even nicer by taking the stripes off

Good looking shoe I would buy again but if prime net go smaller size

The moment I tried these on I knew The materials are top quality and everything about the fit of the shoe is spot on Will definitely be buying more of these in the future

The Adidas NMD shoe line is the epitome of style and comfort I absolutely love these shoes however I was a bit disappointed with my purchase The product description for this shoe tends to be a little inaccurate and the photos are a bit misleading For example the core color tends to be more of a grey than a black In addition the heel loop is grey not black like the picture shows I would have returned them due to this fact but I bought two pairs as couple shoes for my girlfriendbirthday I could not take them back once I already showed her She still liked them but she would have loved the pair that was described and shown on the adidas website Still a great shoe but only 4 stars from me

The boost pattern looks fake fish scale looking not a big fan

These shoes and the Adidas Ultraboost are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The quality is great as well One thing I might recommend is getting a half size smaller than what you normally wear I wear a 12 but i think with the primeknit material I could go down to an 11 5

These shoes are great for walking and some running The main factor is comfort and being stylish to go with it

Great shoe and very comfortable Runs big go half a size down

Comfortable as crazy but get kinda dirty quick woowoo

Sizes run a little big Make sure to order a smaller size

How comfortable the shoe is and a perfect shoe nmn

look great comfortable sturdy would buy again and again

Very comfortable and low priced and a great feel when walking

Love the way the shoes look and feel The primeknit gives the shoe a good feel

My TTS fit is a 12 but because of the primeknit I had to go down a full size Probably the first time I have had that dramatic a size difference and I own multiple ultraboosts and NMDs That being said it is a great color way with high quality material and extremely comfortable especially for wide or flat feet I get compliments on them all the time I wish Adidas made higher quantities of these in smaller sizes so I could buy a pair of the khaki color for my daughter

I love shoes and this shoe is no exception it is good looking and is extremely comfortable

Classic NMD PK shilloette and perfect for the summer I actually removed the stripping in these for a custom look

Easily the most comfortable thing to ever touch my foot With thick or thin socks it feels like a cloud it makes me just want to stand still and enjoy Walking in them is easy too once the foam adjusts to your foot bed

The comfort is great compared to mesh nmds Never thought they were this comfy

Great basic shoe Turn it into a fire shoe easily

I sized down a full size for a perfect fit These are quite expensive for shoes but they are comfortable and constructed well

got these for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he loves them

Fits looks and overall good buy Just what I expected

The perfect everyday sneaker I actually am a10 5 EEE I went to a size 11 and have a perfect fit The plugs are smaller than the r2 which I had to return would love to see a black red pattern similar to what came out in r2

Walking with these shoes feels like you are walking on clouds It is extremely comfortable and wraps around your foot like a sock

Best shoes it is very confortable beautiful it is perfect shoes

Perfect shoe for FatherDay My dad absolutely loves this shoe

Perfect stylish comfortable versatile wear them all the time

Great shoes Get many compliments on them every time I wear them

Solid addition to the ever growing NMD Pk line Goes with everything and great city sneaker

Love them look and comfort wise BUT the fabric is fraying after only 3 weeks of wear Very disappointed especially given the price

PK is amazing but the sole is some what uncomfortable

Great shoe no complaints at all All around solid shoe

Very conformtable shoe with a clean look can not beat that

Very comfy looks great and very stylish Love the compliments

I Normally wear an 11 5 and I bought an 11 and they are still big just wish the sizing was more accurate

It is so light weight and comfortable It is like walking on air

Start by saying I love the shoe Super comfortable when worn with higher socks Problem with the tag on the back though Spent a weekend at the zoo and downtown walking everywhere and the pull tag on the back of the shoe rubs your ankle RAW Footbed is as comfortable as can be but back tag is a killer of an otherwise awesome design Maybe I just got a bad one

it is so comfortable and light I would really recommend this

Shoes are too big need to exchange foe smaller size

My 11yr old son bought these and loves them He says they are very comfortable

Best shoe I have purchased in the last 5 years hands down

Very comfy and looks very nice but I believe it is not true to size and it runs half size bigger

It is a good looking nmd However the boost on these particular NMD are different than on other ones The boost on these have a less distinct nipple

The shoes are softer and more lightweight than I thought

Ended up returning the shoe because it was uncomfortably too big The width was perfect but the length was about 2 sizes off The comfort was okay not as comfortable as the ultraboost but okay The only other thing that bothered me was the heel loop on the back was super rough and rubbed my ankle raw Probably will not buy another pair

these are dope but shoe fabric is a bit loose at the front

I love the feel of the material and shoe is light weight The comfort level is amazing

This was supposed to be my replacement for not getting the Parley Ultraboosts but I managed to buy them later which is why I am returning this pair

amazing shoe i lobe it to death its my bby and fav thing

Amazing going to order in more colors The shoe is so comfortable Easily my favorite shoe They look much better in person

Very comfortable for the use I have for them This is in line with my experience on shoes I bought from Adidas but the added benefit is the design which I really like

Everything about this shoe is perfect The only bad thing is that they are hard to clean but I guess that is just how it is with white shoes

Comfort is great The shoes look even better in person

ran bigger than what i normally wear like the fit

I got a 7 5 which usually fits perfectly with any other shoe but this seems to run large When walking the primeknit on the inside of the foot will overlap and basically not fit to the foot completely

Sad I I had to return this simply because it ran a WHOLE SIZE too big

great looking and comfortable shoe highly recomend

This is a fantastic designed shoes with perfect materials color and style I loved it

My son loves this kicks but one sneaker differs in the back The loop is angled inward and the rubber material is thicker than the other and rubs his ankle bloody but he will not let me send them back

Great shoes This review request is a pain in the rear

Super comfy I was skeptical at first with this show lacking any type of support structure around the front

This shoe is very comfortable to wear when walking around town

Easy to wear perfect color matches most of my personal clothing

They run about a half to full size too big But other than that they are great

I love the shoe the only problem it runs to big

First sneaker with BOOST and i love it so comfortable feels like you are wearing nothing on your feet The response when you walk in them all day and your feet do not hurt

I am a womensize 7 and bought a 5 it is perfect

Exceeds my expectations and fits perfectly yoooooo

I find that the pkare like walking with just socks Super lightweight and comfortable Perfect fit I got TTS Breathable shoes

Really nice shoes Super comfortable and great style

It has an amazing design and extreme comfort I really recommend this shoe

The color way is great the comfort level is above average not a big fan of the tab on the back but other than that a great product

Runs large I recommend a full size down size They are good but if you want to feel the primeknit well

I love this product because it is good looking and goes with anything

I bought these shoes for my boyfriend and he was ecstatic He is constantly getting compliments on them and is always telling me about how comfortable they are I even got myself a pair

I have other shoes of this kind and was interested in the color

it is very nice very comfortable and the style is amazing

I love everything Adidas is dropping right now

It stays true to size The material is very comforming to the feet Daily shoe

Any boost material shoe is great 10 out of 10 Definitely would recommend

I wear an 11 5 These were way to big they fit like a 13

Great shoe thought I was unsure to buy it at first but it looks better on feet then pictures

The product has style with comfort Can wear all day with no hurting feet

These NMDare so fresh I am not gonna wear them until my wedding day

I found it difficult to clean a spot on the mid sole where the boost technology is It was a little dirty and I attempted to use Jason Mark cleaning supply but it did not successfully clean the spot I am an avid support of Adidas and I have about 11 pairs of ultra boosts but this pair is my least favorite

I am a major hypebeast and while these NMDs do bring the hype they also are both comfortable to lounge in and to walk run in

Looks even better in person than online in the pictures

Too large and I wanted them to fit smaller in other to keep them

It is a very comfortable shes and can be a shoes that i can wear everyday

This product is very comfortable However the sizing is large Typically in a size 10 ordered a 9 5 in these shoes and they were still roomy Ended up returned them and getting a size 9 instead which fit perfectly I rated the quality slightly less because there was a minor imperfection on one of the side stripes

Great execution on an already great silhouette Boost is life

I like it because of the colorways and also the prime knit looks nice

This is a really good shoe The Primeknit and Boost combination is great and the shoe is very light and has good ventilation The only problem with the NMD PK is the size I wear size US 11 in Jordans and 10 5 in Yeezy V2s but I had to get these in 9 5 for a comfortable fit Even then there is a little bit of room but tying the laces well solves that problem I would suggest going down 5 or 1 whole size I have not worn this shoe much but I will definitely be wearing it soon

Comfort and style Been wearing them everywhere since I got them

did not like how it looks in person probably going to reuturn

1st pair of nmds and boost very impressed comfort also quality is good will most defintely be buying another pair and have also picked up some ultra boost post getting these

Comfortable shoe Good purchase for price and very stylish

I love the primeknit sock line and the color of the shoe

Sweet original shoes have two pair Scared to get them dirty

New favorite shoe the comfort of the shoe is amazing

great looking shoe better than i imagine and more

Light weight with great support and amazing design

Good looking shoes that run true to size Only gripe is a minor onethe heel tag can chafe

The fit is true love the colorway and the boost is nice and firm

I love the shoe Had to go a whole size down because they run big

I can fit in 9 and 9 1 2 because of the unique opening of the shoe Recommend bigger size than ur usual size

Ver comfortable Great summer color way Good quality

I love the materials and the comfort of this shoe

Comfortable and it looks good and love the color too

Love these shoes I will be buying another pair Add running socks to these shoes and it is like slippers for training

Great looking shoe Way too large though had to order them twice to get the right size

Usually a ten and a half with the xr1 but this was a little on the large size Still dope

I bought the shoes with the idea of reselling them but when they arrived i couldnt bring myself to do that The shoes were so comfortable and looked great that I could not possibly sell these away

The Primeknit NMDs fit so well and feel really great Not as much cushioning as the Ultra Boost Line but more than enough for daily wear

the adidas NMD is a great shoe for casual wear and is extremly comfotable however the sizing runs atleast a half size to big i usually wear a 11 5 and got an 11 and i still had a little wiggle room great shoe though

it looks great but it is not as comfortable as it looks

these shoes are very comfortable you can wear them all day without them making your feet tired like wearing jordans all day these are not basketball shoes they do not hurt your feel after 4 hours of wear

Great pair of kicks in person one of my favorite NMDs in recent history

These shoes are always super lit A little narrow for my feet but still very comfortable Love the color scheme and the look I am in love

Good looking shoe Comfortable Solid purchase Buy with cinfidence

The most comfortable shoes in the market today Love it

Sizing is hard to get right with these shoes 10 5 was way too big yet the size 10 seems a little too small

Great comfort and looks great I would recommend this to anyone who wants quality nmd

Very comfortable and light weight but sizing is off Too big for me

Great color way Remind me of the zebra yeezys glitch camo nmd

It is my second favorite nmd shoe that I have in terms of quality but with looks that is is the best

Got this for my daughter 16 BD She been wanting an NMD forever Now that I got her this one she is even more in love She said it is so comfortable that you do not even feel like you are wearing shoes Size and width wise are perfect to her size she is a 7 so I got her size 5 in men and it is fit her perfectly

Wish I would have gotten asize smaller But other than that the shoes are amazing

My girlfriend loves it it is a tiny it too big for her feet but she just put an insole in and it fits great

it is exactly what I wanted Goes with everything Very comfortable

Very comfortable and versatile shoe The shoes go with several outfits

the sexiest most comfortable shoe i own and a perfect shoe to look like you have the sexy runner look without running

These shoes look and feel amazing Very nicely crafted

it is just great performance could not expect more just love it

Love the way they feel I own 3 pairs of NMD PK uppers and they are all amazing Sizing on this pair was the best though

Sucker for the Glitch Nmd Colorway Primeknit is only Nmd I care for Run 1 2 Sz big and Nmd comfort is far from ultra boost 93 17 or YZY level but put your UB insoles in your pk nmds and thank me later Only con imo is that the retail price point should be 150 For 10 more the ultra boost is much more worthy but limited to colorunless you can get limited or Consortium releases

Great comfort highly recommended for maximum comfort

Really nice shoe can match easily an very comfortable love the shoe

The product has the best feel and is wonderful for a traveler

Definitely recommend this shoe

I really like the shoe overall but you have to get a 1 2 smaller then you actually wear

Great gift Got these for a friend and they loved them

Very comfortable better than the yeezys in my opinion

The pk and boost seem differentOn this pair then all the exclusive pairs

The boost is awesome They are really comfy and responsive Great shoes to wear everyday and have a really nice design and fit They take a little to wear in and my heels hurt the first day but after the break in period I love them

Comfortable as heck Adidas is on top of their game

The shoe is very comfortable and comes in several colors

Top notch Comfortable and stylish love them A must have for summertime

I like the color way and the Primeknit and I like how it feels

Looks great and fit and easy on and off Love the comfort and looks with jeans and for working out

Most comfortable shoes I own now Even more comfortable than the ultraboost

I liked the item because they are good quality and comfy

The shoes run too big Should go 1 2 or 1 size to have a perfect fit

Love the style of the shoe as well as comfort Fit is not exactly right

The style of the shoes and comfortness are the best

I love this product but I would like to say a heads up on the sizing would be nice

Best looking shoe but comfort is not where the ultra boost is

Goes with everything has a great color stands out

Nothing beats boost for comfort primeknit is also super comfortable

Very classy And fancy too I like the color Size fits me perfectly

Great shoe primeknit is key color is flawless adidas has again hit it out of the park

This is my first NMD R1 Primeknit and it did not dissapoint Granted the r1 does not have the boost feel that other boost shoes do but it is still much more comfortable than the average shoe Looks nice to would recommend

These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had They are like a big breathable sock However back part that touches you ankle has stitching that wore through irritated my skin I assume that this goes away after the shoes have been broken in I recommend to wear more than no show socks when you first get them Other than that they are great and are easy to match to casual outfits

I was a little skeptical of purchasing this shoe at first because I was not sure of the sizing due to the primeknit material If you are Interested in buying this product I would recommend that you go true to size for a comfortable fit If you like a more snug fit I would recommend you go a size down Overall this shoe turns heads left and right

They are the most comfortable shoes I have put my feet into

They feel awesome to wear and look just as great on me

Looks good and comfortable just go half a size down Love these shoes

Comfy shoe Nice colorway What you expect from NMD

These shoes are so comfortable And I love the style as well

Love the fit and look of this shoe it is a must cop



One of the pair came with stripe bended out Not glued correctly

9 5 fits like a 10 10 5 how is that all the nmds are different depending on the material it is a joke adidas needs to step up there game

Adidas is the best Adidas fan since day 1one

Shoe is comfortable but the back on the heel start to bother after a while

I would like a refund because the glitch pattern was faded and there were errors in the stitching of the PK

This is my 10th pair of NMDs and they go well with everything Love the way they fit and most of all how great they look My Ultraboosts are definitely more comfortable but my NMDs are more for style If you are buying the primeknits they tend to be a half size larger so make sure you go with a half size SMALLER then your normal size

I felt the material was too thin for the price of the shoe Also no arch support which is important but willing to forgo if the style is right The sock ankle support did not fit snug around lower ankles and had a fold in it Absolutely love the Adidas NMDand with this the look is there just needs higher quality thicker material

Very comfortable shoe Great style Was alittle expensive

Love the colors of these shoes So light and comfortable

Its a must cop for the summer time Its keeps your feet feeling good

Great coloraWay perfect timing for the summer Wish all adidas shoes were this easy to obtain

Great shoe If You have nmds then you know how comfortable they are specially the primeknit versions I am usually a 10 but 9 5 fits perfec

Adidas knows what they are doing now and days coming out with new shoes that are A1

The shoe itself looks dope The ankle elasticity is nice but they definitely needed to be broken in as the first couple of times I wore them they causes some pretty uncomfortable friction on the back of my ankles That problem has since faded after wearing them so often Great pair of shoes

Very comfortable shoe with a beautiful color way It is a perfect fit and looks really sleek on the foot

Always love the cool NMDbut color wave is a bit boring on this model

Really like the prime knit and color Being that it is primeknit it fits a little more loose But other than that great purchase

Great looking shoe and amazing comfort Love the whole collection

Great colorway for the summer Keep in mind the Primeknits always run 1 2 size too big

The shoe fits great true to size Easy to walk in and looks good too

I have been waiting to get a pair of NMDs And hopped on these Back leaves a blister really easily And your toes will stick out the sides a little

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn feels like I am wearing a sock

NMD shoes are very comfortable and looks great at all times

Love this shoe make sure you order half a size down as it runs large amazing sneaker

So comfy I love these shoes order a half size smaller though

These are fuego A great summer shoe and goes with everything

Good design and looks great on feet Love the width of the sneakers since I have wide feet Comfort wise the sneakers are in the middle compared to ultra boost Though this can be remedy easily if you take insoles from a pair of ultra boost and add them to your nmds

Unparalleled comfort for work or play I stand on my feet at work all day and these shoes look great support and cushion my feet from fatigue and pain On my days off are perfect for a run or just goofing around

the whites have beautiful detail comfortable shoes that look absolutely dope pictures do not do it justice

Amazing fit style and super duper comfortable Highly recommend prineknits

Good shoe good shoe good shoe good shoes good shooos

love the nmd R1 wish same male color ways came in woman

They look great but they run about a size and a half large I normally get a 10 I got a 9 but maybe should have gotten an 8 5

The shoe is very light comfy and looks awesome with the khaki color

Very soft and comfortable shoes I love the PK version of NMD

The most comfortable shoe out on the market period

Great colorway and comfortable shoe Had to go a half size down though

The most comfortable pair of sneakers I have owned I am a 7 5 in womens regular sneakers 6 5 primeknit nmd and 7 regular nmd but sized down to a 5 in menand it fit perfectly Such a cute color scheme for summer Most comfortable shoes for leg day

it is a nice definitely would purchase more Perfect for wide feet

These are my 4th pair of NMDs love the colors and fit

I personally love nmd r1 shoes and I had not ever owned the primeknit style It is extremely comfortable to wear and I definitely reccomend this product

A real nice addition to the NMD lineup Great colorway What can I say

They are so comfortable to wear Ive been trying to get nmds ever since they came out so im glad I finally got a pair

Amazing looking and fitting shoe Love the comfort of the PK Runs half size big

It was ok but it was way too big I usually wear an 8 5 and I ordered an 8 5 but it felt way larger

Dope color great sole and cushion Would recommend to a friend

So comfortable and stylish I love the ultra boost as well as the primeknit

I like this sneakers because of it is earth tone color and it is also stylish

i do not understand why adidas does not tell people to go down half size in these they run entirely too big too wide there is no way anyone who buys these true to size will be satisfied with the fit

it is an inch longer than my big toe which I got the size I usually get I personally think it looks a lot better in the pictures than real life

comfortable but sized to big like the color and quality

These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and the flexibility makes my feet feel less confined than any other shoes I have worn before

The shoe is very comfortable It also looks really nice The way the shoe looks is great and the way it feel on the foot is great

Nmds are extremely comfortable ver good color way

Adidas has really been stepping up its game Kicks are always fire emoji

i was wearing them for three years now they are trendy and comfortable

Really comfortable and nice I just bought these this morning and already love them

Comfort and style

Fire Get a half size smaller than you normally would

Nmd is a great shoe just wish adidas will start with colored stripes instead of same as body of shoe everyone recognizes adidas with the 3 stripes white stripes black tri color makes shoes pop

Great shoe overall I got a lot of compliments i got the tricolor ones

Ordered on the original release date and they were huge Gave them away as a present then went a full size down when the are released later in the month PERFECT So comfortable A little less cushion in the ball of the foot compared to ultra boosts but still ridiculously comfortable They look as good as they feel

Beautiful great looking product I was not to get my size

This shoe is definitely not for anyone with a wide foot

Good looking more perfect good to wear must try best shoes I ever had

Hated No support what so ever Bought several pair

This shoe is amazing in comfort and the best in design Adidas is on point combining the simple design with its boost technology And the color ways are breaking necks when people see you wearing them

I love this shoe of the future like adidas should be proud of them selves and adidas please make more of the Glitch camo pK 

1st I like adidas cause of comfortable and stylish I have noticed since 10 years ago Most of sneakers style still reuse the idea from 80s you know what brand I talking about Now adidas come with the new idea and style sneaker which everyone love it But one cons is really hard to get them Hope adidas can improve this problem

I absolutely love this shoe And any primeknit for that matter Please make more primeknits Make them available to customers like me who buy them just to wear them Favorite shoes in my closet NMD LIFE

I like the NMD Primeknits I have been copping select NMDsince the beginning The shoe does run a bit big but you will learn that after your first purchase The Primknits are definitely my favorite I have several pair and yes they are very difficult to get especially going against the Bots Smh

Got lucky with these kicks Very comfortable and light

I love these NMDtheir comfortable and look great with any fit

Best show ever my second nmd and they are so comfortable

I was able to get my size in the new primeknit colorway pretty easily very excited to get them in Love the whole nmd line probably my favorite shoes out

Provides beyond maximum comfort and breathability

Amazing casual shoe and decent running shoe By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have bought many shoes over the years and these are the most comfortable The white boost soles do take some upkeep as they do start chipping away over time but I guess it is the price for extreme comfort I have had mine since the original ones dropped and they have been amazing The primeknit is very breathable and does leave your feet a bit chilly on cold days

I have put these shoes through extensive running and walking The block elements on the sole dig into the side of your heel that will cause blisters The mesh versions will not last 3 months running and the primenits last around 5 months until they start breaking apart which I still wear because the mesh hasnt separated from the sole A good shoe that looks great but not that much of a great runner with all of the boost technology

Feels like socks Lucky to have been able to cop a pair No bots needed

Good Quality and does not go on sale very comfortable

Amazing shoe One of the Top colorway out Super comfortable and stylish

too hard to get a shoe that is alright and not that comfortable

Great Product Would recommend Adidas is the best shoe company

The weight and ventilation is comparable to socks

Love your variations of primeknit uppers And the shoe is very durable

Boi I swear ill kick everyonewoo ha who gave 1 star

Why not get them there very nice and comfortable

very comfortable and stylish and very simple colour

Comfort and stylish good price Unique for all

Great shoe nice style comfort and style

Just not a good shoe They did not fit well at all

Very uncomfortable Sizing is off Bought these for my son ripped within a week

These are FANTASTIC In my opinion the most comfortable Adidas shoe available Definitely go a half size down at least these run large If you grab a pair that is a little too big just put in an insole since these come without

I do not get the hype with these shoes They do not fit properly and they hurt my feet Looks good tho sizing is off

There is a huge difference between these and the regular mesh NMDs The Primeknit is a much softer and conforming material and I would 100 recommend trying to get them when they drop Most comfortable casual shoe ever made along with the UB

Good style and good price and good color and comfortable

Hurts my anckles fam please do not cop fam Listen to me fam

The shoes are pretty comfy and good to walk in all day

This is the best shoe I have ever had Seriously buy it if you are considering it is so great Only complaint is that the boost get dirty after a while but can be cleaned with soap and water Overall this such a GREAT shoe

I wanted an attractive and comfortable shoe Nike Air Max Deluxe Casual shoes are just that with great support for my feet

I treated myself to these for Air Max Day Thunder Blueare pretty dope Colors are not as vivid as online but they still pop Love the full length Air Max unit Tongue stays in place Great shoe so far

I ordered a pair on a different site and am very happy with the shoe That being said you NEED to go a half size down with this shoe It runs very long Wish they were not sold out on that website because I would exchange them if so

Love the look of the shoe online and in person Had to send them back for a smaller size Generally wear a 14 but the 14 felt enormous

So happy Nike brought these back Super comfy and can wear them with anything Only issue I have is they were mailed in a second hand orange Nike box and not the original red box they should have come with

Was recommended this as a daily driver for running short to long distance running A great pair all rounder

Overall fits snug compared to the Pegasus 34 Snug like a sock not too tight If you are used to wearing soccer shoes it is very similar but as a running shoe If you want room for your feet this is NOT the shoe for you

I have ran in the Pegasus since the 33 the 35 is my least favorite The rev and ed upper and sole make this feel like I am wearing something different from what I am use to The heal in the 35s slip slightly and the shoe feels more narrow The tongue sticks up too far and rubs against your ankle I own 20 pairs of running shoes only two pairs of 35s This is still a good shoe and I would go as far as saying I would run a marathon it But previous versions of the Pegasus far surpass this one model

I have long been a Nike runner but typically have stuck with the Lunarglides until they completely overhauled and ruined their design a few years back

This is my first time trying out the pegasus series and I definitely like these Had to go up a half size for my wide feet but they fit perfect I love the full length zoom and great transition Great pick up

They brought back the width and feel of the 33in the 35 and also added the nice feature of the Achilles tongue to keep the heel from caving in The 34were a bit narrow and it felt like your feet could land outside of the sole sometimes but you will land solidly in the middle of the sole every time in the 35Colors also all look nice If you liked the 33and then did not like the 34do not worryyou should like this model

It is very comfortable and thats what I was looking for in a running sneakers The color I got was an highlight as other person were asking where they could get one As of this I am purchasing one for my friend Its comfy bouncy and neat lets see how durable it is Great running sneakers Nike

I walk three miles a day and these shoes are an absolute pleasure to walk in Check them out

Long time Pegasus fan Some years are better than others my previous favorite was the 30 The Pegasus 35 is much different than any previous Pegasus These have a very springy feel from the full length Zoom Air but still a very shock absorbing midsole The heel to toe transition in every stride is very smooth These are my new favorite Pegasus unseating my former favorite the Pegasus 30 Much better cushioned than the 31 34 as well I will definitely pick up another pair or two over time

Very comfortable for traveling though the airport or walking through the city

Although I do not run I still look for a running shoe for my long walks that will not fatigue my feet This shoe fits the bill Light and very comfortable The rear of the shoe looks high but it does not irritate my achilles I liked my first pair so much I bought another pair Highly recommended

Ive been runing all my life and i gotta say these are some of the best nike runing shoes Ive had Im 5 11 190 lb and these are dope Ive put them through about 150 miles at this point and they are still very springy and responsive Full tread too

Maybe the average person has a slender foot I am not sure But my feet are wide and I wanted to see if these could fit them I went a full size up in the regular width because my true size in the Extra Wide version of this shoe is not available I have tried on narrow shoes for most of my life but these may be the most extreme example Even going a full size up getting into them was a bit tough and then the pressure felt all around was too much it is a shame because I like the color I picked the moonbeam Nike should provide a variety of colors in their wide versions because all I see is a standard black and white unassuming but uninteresting If you have a wide foot particularly in the forefoot be wary of the standard width Try it in a store if you really want this shoe

I just got my second pair of these after wearing them for about 9 months as a shoe I wore both to school and for my highschool track and cross country practices The upper is very durable and does not look too different from my new pair after roughly 600 miles These shoes have performed extremely well in many circumstances but I have found them best suited for track and road workouts They are rather snug out of the box and take some time to break in if you want a more relaxed feel After running in the new pair compared to my old ones I have found it much easier to push the pace and have experienced less soreness in my hamstring and calves The durablility on the midsole is alright considering I have completely overworn these but they do start to wear down on the back and the foam broke apart form the rubber outsole pretty quickly After experiencing a fresh pair of these badboys I can say that they are very responsive and a quality choice for a daily trainer that can carry you through all types of workouts and conditions

I needed good running shoe that was durable comfortable and fashionable These were the perfect choice

The quality of assembly is just poor I have had two shoes delivered to me today and both of the rear heels were damaged indented or oddly compressed The stitching of the rear upper was sloppy and uneven The shoe runs narrow when compared to my WinFloThe swoosh is more of a pink hue than red I have been seeing this more and more The quality of NIKE products are continuing to decline in both assembly material quality and longevity I have been slowly seeing this increase across all product lines from Running Jordan to NIKELAB for years now What a let down NIKE Simply get it together I am returning both and will buy some Ultra Boosts

As compared to previous versions the newer Pegasus medium is way too narrow I had run in these for years but recent versions are too narrow and cause significant pain in my lateral foot after wearing them for an extended period of time

I love the shoes I have had several pair of Pegasus before and I have no complaints about the fit comfort or durability I will say that I paid the extra money to get the Nike ID customs I chose to pick the Wolf Grey which I was expecting to be a shade of Grey but they just got here and they were purple I think the title of the color is EXTREMELY misleading I was disappointed when I got them but there is not much I can do at this point

The Pegasus is my favorite shoe for running and the one I get everytime I need a new pair so originally I liked the new design a lot I have narrow feet and this pair seemed to not stretch out wide as much as previous ones But unfortunately the sole ripped up in less than 3 months of having these pretty disappointing since other than that I love the shoe

This shoe is super comfortable and is an amazing running shoe but the cushion in the heel has already started to tear off

I currently have logged around 130 miles in these shoes so far and they feel brand new still They fit comfortably snug after the break in period you are feet will start to love the shoe There was a little heel slippage in the beginning but nothing that hinders your run I do not feel it anymore They have a nice bounce and very comfortable midsole Great for long runs and tempo runs Nike hit a grand slam with these

The point on the back of the sole is much more pronounced than it appears in the photos on this site When I took them out of the box my family and I all laughed at how they looked very elfish The sole comes to a long sharp point out the back of the shoe

I normally wear a medium width size 7 5 which is the size I bought of these shoes They do fit snug like a glove toes almost touch the front of shoe It only took 1 time wearing to get adjusted to that feeling Being snug there is absolutely no foot movement which is great 1 star taken off because they have no traction on wet roads at least on the first few uses First time wearing I landed on a wet area of the sidewalk that had been recently watered and nearly lost my footing I have had other running and trail shoes that had same problem on first few wears being slippery so I am hoping the same is true with these

Fit and confort are good Size ran true I am really disappointed that the toe collapsed after taking one step After wearing for 5 minutes a permanent dimple has formed just to the side of the midpoint Toe should be reinforced better

I am a returning Air Pegasus wearer this being my 4th pair My first pair was recommended by my local running shop and I have never looked back I land heavily on my heel and also show significant wear under my forefoot so the new full length zoom bag has been a welcome addition with the newest release Will probably be the only running shoe I ever wear I am considering the new Turbo model for my next pair

I tried these out and now i am thinking of getting another pair I love the fit and the finish Right out of the box they fit perfectly They were supportive and comfortable

I wanted to like this shoe I really did The upper is one of the most comfortable on a Pegasus in a long time at least for me However at the end of the day what is under your feet maters much more than what is on top And this is where this yearpegasus falls flat thanks to the new zoom setup I was excited to get the shoe after hearing it would include a full length zoom baghowever after the 50 70 mile honeymoon period ended with the shoe I felt like the ride had become uncharacteristically harsh for me From what I have seen online it looks as though the full length zoom bag came with a tradeoff of having the height of the bag decreased resulting in less zoom under your foot at a given point And I am a forefoot striker so this revelation was disappointing since your forefoot is also where there is the least foam cushioning Although it is a serviceable snappy trainer for trails dirt roads I log most of my miles on pavement So I have to give it a 2 5 rating

The arch of the shoe seems too far back and the toe box is slightly too small I had to send them back

These shoes are great if you are looking solely for comfort When i tried them on for the first time my feet were in heaven I have bunions on both feet and you can not go wrong with these shoes The issue I had was when I look down at the shoes while standing I can see dents at the tips They were not able to maintain their shape Maybe in a few years when I do not care what my shoes look like I will purchase a pair again Right now I am still caught up in appearance so I will pass on these comfy sneakers

I love these new Nike Pegasus 35 running shoes I have been running in Nike shoes since the 1970In fact my first pair were Nike Daybreaks Without question these new Pegasus 35are the best running shoes I have owned Just to nit pik I do not like the flat shaped shoe laces that come with the Pegasus 35I hate them because they often come untied while I am in a good run AND I hate to double tie my laces I wish the Pegasus 35came with the rounded laces that Nike includes with their structure shoes I have NEVER had those laces come untied while I was on a run

The transition speedy feel and smooth transition make running in any other Pegasus feel slow clunky and stiff The new full length zoom unit and softer foam is plush yet still responsive This shoe is almost perfect However the arch support is odd and misplaced feels too large and awkwardly pushed too far back towards the heel making the second problem the heel to toe drop more noticeable on to the only other gripe the heel offsetI would love to see Nike turn this same sole and cushion setup into an 8mm drop This is a speed shoe and I feel the 10mm offset just takes away a bit from the transition All that being said it is still the best Pegasus to date and the best running shoe on the market Just has two glaring design flaws but everything else is so well designed it still performs excellent Good job Nike

Love these I would been running im the same old pair of Asics for the past few years but got these and it is night and day They are super responsive and you feel the bounce and support immediately on your first few steps Ran about 3 miles right out of the box and did not want to stop Highly recommend

This is my first Pegasus I am midfoot striker and currently have the zoom elite 8 ze8 flyknit lunar 3 fl3 in rotation and was looking for a shoe sit in between After wearing them about and two runs these were sent back as the soles of my feet were sore aching There seems to be too much or too soft cushioning Perhaps it needed to break in but when a shoe hurts it is not worth it They do look great though The only other time I have experienced this was when I tried adidas boost

I wore the Air Zoom Pegasus 32 shoes forever and this model did not disappoint Lightweight but durable and stable I would give it 10 stars if I could

HeelWhile I will admit the point at the heel of the shoe looks very cool it is a significant change in the structure of the shoe The change in structure has made it near impossible to tie the shoe in a manner that prevents your heal from rubbing up and down due to a loose fit on the back of the shoe as well as coming loose and losing stability I do not understand the benefits this design was meant to yield

This shoe is extremely comfy I have had them for about 70 miles now and the end is no where near I typically need a supportive shoe my last few pairs were the zoom fly lunar glide and structures but these are still excellent for my foot Epic reacts and odyssey reacts do not work well for me so if you have a similar running style to mine these should be great Fits true to size for Nike but Nike is always narrower for me I am a 9 5 in Nike but a 9 standard sizing Look incredible on foot Nike Colors team has done a great job with this shoe I like bright colors so I got the launch color However after a 7 mile run and wearing them around a bit longer afterwards the color bled onto my nice and expensive volt colored dri fit running socks No regrets with buying this shoe at all just fair warning if you are going to wear light colored socks

Fantastic do it all running shoe Currently using these for Half Marathon training Just ordered a 2nd pair to rotate and so I have a fresher pair to pull for race day Weight is low Transition is top notch Comfort is perfect Soft when going slow extremely responsive when picking up the pace Definitely my favorite shoe of the year and I have run in LOT of different shoes this year Nice job on this one Nike

The Nike Pegasus line of running shoes is the best running shoes I have come across I put a lot of hard miles on my running shoes and tried A LOT of different brands but the Nike Pegasus shoes are the only ones able to hold up to the abuse They are incredibly comfortable and I wont run in anything else Keep up the good work Nike

I initially loved this shoe because it is extremely comfortable stylish and would be a fantastic running shoe if it did not have the worst durability of any shoe I have ever worn Within a week of purchasing the shoe the top half of the shoe separated from the bottom half This was under limited use as I only went on two road runs and occasional use I am very disappointed by this shoe and plan on returning it for a refund

Very unimpressed I have owned these shoes for about 5 days and I noticed on the the left shoe that a hole has already formed on the toe I have ran once with these shoes on the material is cheesy and I will not be buying another Nike shoe with mesh again

This is my first pair of the Pegasus model and they are awesome I have been using them for my daily training runs of 5 to 9 miles for the past 2 weeks I even feel I could wear them for tempo runs and maybe some speed workouts too The fit is wonderful with a roomy toe box The attached tongue is nice means it will not move or bunch up The inner liner is soft and comfortable I find the heel cup secure and I find the unique design for the achilles very beneficial I hope this achilles design becomes a trend with future models I remember having to cut a notch in the same area of a pair of older lunar racers for my achilles Overall great shoe right out of the box

This shoe has great heel stability compared to the epic react I would highly recommend this shoe to any one whether it be for running or streetwear

The Air Zoom Pegasus is a great running shoe but hopefully some of the designs will revert back to the 34th edition As another reviewer noted the toe box is smaller now In addition the new point at the bottom of the back of the shoe should be removed from future versionsthe point causes the shoe to not fit properly in foot holders on rowing machines

I had been running in Pegs since the Pegasus 30but last year I searched around for other options after the 34just did not work for me I was excited for the release of the 35though after hearing all the new updates that were coming specifically the full length foam and lighter weight I fell in love with the shoe after my first run in it it is padded enough for daily running on concrete but does not feel squishy while running The responsiveness is great Almost 2 months of 70 miles per week later the shoes are still holding up although I will probably get new ones within the next couple weeks just to be safe

For reference I have had recently the Pegasus 30 31 32 33 and 34 I still wear the 33 and 34 The 31 was ok the 34 is awesome I am very happy with it But this one is legit The only issue was all my 34 is an 11 5 which was a bit loose but fine I could have gone down to 11 and this 35 model I bought in 11 after trying the 11 5 which was HUGE I could probably get away with a 10 5 If you are in between sizes go down it is soft but not flimsy light but durable Very nice features to hug your foot

From mid 2015 until the end of 2017 I wore different pairs of Adidas running shoes and I felt fine but the marketing got to me I saw the cool color ways and had to try them the 34s and wow did I not know what I was missing out on but then the 35s came out and they seriously push you to run faster by pushing you on to your forefoot toes and make the 34s irrelevent the only problem I could even think of is that it is kind of annoying when you are driving with the tail fin thing on the back that you feel like you are damaging but even then I would not even remove that due to the looks Also even with the bright colorway and nearly 300 miles I have yet to stain my upper

Run almost 100 km in those shoes since purchased them a month ago Really good lateral support so I do not think every step about ankle position Sole angle is great too it is so easy to land on toes Unlike Nike Free RN which were a complete failure I never had blisters in those shoes Price was a bit high when they launched it Now it is a bit better

I have been running in 34and I really enjoyed them They had more room in the toe box in all directions which I liked 35 toe box is small and the midsole height is low and not adjustable due to the tongue design The tongue gussets does not stretch as it should because they are sewn in not sure what the designers were doing The full length air is a nice upgrade but the foam sole felt a bit too squishy but I can not be certain since I did not run in them Returned and purchased some 34before they ran out of stock

do not buy these shoes are terrible You will wait for them to get broken in and they never will and then the 30 day return policy will be up My toes are black and my feet are bleeding because of these stupid things These are the worst shoes I have ever owned and they will not give a refund

I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for more years than I can remember and IMO the 35s are a bust The fit for the first time is very different and not at all for me The upper arch area cannot be adjusted like the previous versions and the front has less lacing slots In addition to the poor adjustments Nike added design gimmicks that serve no purpose pointed back ends and heals This one unfortunately is going back I hope the 36s are better

I plan to buy 2 more colors I am not a runner I bought them because they are crazy comfortable and gorgeous

I like the feel but they were way to narrow I run quit often I tried several times to make them work just didnt happen Great shoe but narrow

I have 7 pairs of Pegasus 34s Adidas Solar Boost Alpha Bounce and Brooks Glycerin in the closet Pegasus 35 is the best Not quite sure about some reviews regarding a too large toe box I do not feel that at all The 34s certainly feel as big to me I am a big guy wearing size 14 so I have plenty of experience with tight toe boxes no half sizes available for those of us with clown feet Love the soft breathable upper They feel air conditioned especially compared to the new Solar Boost which are like wrapping your foot in aluminum foil and oven roasting at 375 degrees

Just got these in the mail today and am loving them Fit is very similar to the Peg 34but a much more attractive style and color combo I went with the Black Gunsmoke Oil Grey White Excellent ventilation and perfect support for my feet Like all NikeI recommend a half size larger than you would wear in most shoes Very happy with these

i will say these run very much true to size i wear an 11 and these are definitely a size 11 in a normal width

Got my new 35in the mail this week and was surprised when I slipped them on that they are probably a 1 2 size too big I have been wearing Pegasus since 32 and loved the slightly more narrow less toe box room feel of the latest versions as it really fits my foot well This version while lighter and with much more cushion in the heel is a decent upgrade from the 34I would recommend trying a pair on first before buying to make sure you get the right size for you as these do not follow the typical runs smaller narrower Nike specs

These shoes are great However I am only 16 miles in and the right shoes air pod has already popped I trust nike but after this I am not sure anymore I was on the road but there happened to be a small thorn about 1cm long and that was enough for these to pop Disappointed

I have got to say Nike is one of my favorite brands of all time Incredible story and leadership I do not wear athletic shoes from other companies I bought this shoe having worn Free Runs for years The quality of the new Pegasus is great which I expected Nevertheless it fits strange and I have very normal feet There is an exaggerated hump in the middle of the sole for arch support I feel it might be a little extreme That has caused increased pressure on the front of my feet Like I said this shoe is not junk Rather it just does not feel great I will likly be purchasing some new Free Runs as a replacement

I have been running in the Pegasus since the 30s and the 35s do not disappoint as I find it to be a great running shoe I appreciate the space given to the Achilles and the cushioning is better than the 34which I tolerated but it was sort of uneven and felt a bit odd The design is sleek and looks cool as usual and I appreciate the redesign of the traction as it feels and grips better for now at least There are 2 major complaints I have with the 35s The tongue is UNUSUALLY long and it feels so weird I never seen a running shoe with a tongue so high and it is pretty uncomfortable when running Also the shoe does fit true to size but the toe box is a little wide compared to the midfoot area so depending on your foot you might have to play around with different sizes just a heads up It does not fit perfectly and it feels a little off which I guess is a consequence for the Pegasus redesign

I never bought Pegasus before but have tried them a few times I have to say these were a surprise for me I am very happy with the fit comfort aesthetics style and the materials of the upper Very nice upper material looks great and of quality The sole is very comfortable with the full zoom air Fit is true to size Great shoe

Started running with the 32then the 33that were so much better with the Air Zoom in the forefoot 34did not do anything more that the 33except costing more so I was so excited to try my 35with the full Air Zoom Sorry but I have to say I will be sending the 35back as the toe box is actually too wide and does not feel right at all Is it the lost eyelet that makes it feel less snugThe cushioning is improved without adding weight actually lighter than previous versions but the 35are just not right for me

Super bummed to give this 3 stars because the upgrades to the outsole are fantastic Its a great blend of cushion and response The looks are great too But the way they configured the heel allows your foot to slip in the shoe and this is an issue They had this problem with their training shoe the Metcon and it took until version 4 to fix by adding an additional eyelet Hope they can fix in the 36 I returned this for the Epic React Flyknit which has a similar ride and fit

I think this is a good step forward as far as the Pegasus line goes I upgraded from a 33 I had been wearing way too long and I am impressed with most of what the new version has to offer minus one glaring flaw I am not sure if because there is just too much material in the midsole but after 1 wear there was a ridiculous amount of creasing and it just takes away from the overall aesthetic of the shoe I like the shoe itself and do not really want to return them based on how they perform but this just looks very ugly to me and I feel could have been done much better as I have never had this issue before with another pair of Nike running shoes

New to the Air Peg I have been running in Nike racing flats as trainers for the past several seasons but my fave the Zoom Flyknit Streak is no longer available whyBut the 35 with a mostly knit upper and full length zoom sole seemed pretty close and as someone who was never a fan of Lunarlon I thought it was worth the shot First they expectedly fit snug out of the box for the first runI expect that from flyknit and after only a few miles they are already broken in I have not had discomfort with either the tongue or heel counter as mentioned by others I kinda love the firmness of the zoom sole and from strike to roll off it seems really smooth and comfortable I am running a half marathon in them this weekend not really racing as a first distance test but am pretty confident they will perform well I will update if that is not the case but at this time I am looking to use them as my primary pair throughout a season of both speedwork and long slower runs

I do not usually wear Pegasus but I had to give these a try and boy was I pleasantly surprised Starting from the heel that lets your foot slide in the shoe effortlessly to the comfort throughout the insole I was blown away Very light and a comfortably snug fit that I love too

I upgraded from my Pegasus 34to these and am very happy so far I have worn them for 2 days to break them in before running in them but they have been comfortable from the moment I put them on The heel felt a little loose at first but I realized its designed to keep the back away from your achilles and its working exactly as designed I am excited to try these on a run in the next day or so As far as day use I can wear these all day without my feet feeling cr and ed or hot they are great to wear around

Outstanding shoe so far and an upgrade from the 34 If I had petite feet I would consider my own bizarre inadequacies before tanking the star rating on a very strong installment of a pedigree running shoeand simply resign to shopping in the ladies department

Just Ok the shoe runs long and narrow with a big toe box I will getting new 34and 33if I can find them

I usually wear a size 11 in almost all Nike shoes Occasionally a 10 5 I ordered an 11 in these and could barely even fit them on I really like the way they look and someone with VERY narrow feet might enjoy them Had to return them If you can find a wide version than maybe but regular is too narrow

Pitch Black from top to bottom red tongue and windows These are 1st class Holding the air max to its highest potential for looks on these bad boys I do not wear them often bc Im a sneaker head and rotation is important Super air unit with the bounce and height to stand out on their own A must have or try Size is exact to fit

Sneakers fit true to size Very comfortable sneaker

Loved the colors used great quality super comfy and looks great on Husband will only wear the Nike Air Max shoes Each pair lasts a lifetime

Air Max 95 have always provided the best comfort

I bought this about a few weeks ago and I am very satisfied with this product

i bought them sunday and todays thursday came faster than expected

I brought these a few weeks ago and I love the comfort of them

I got my son a pair for school He likes them a lot and they look pretty nice and good on his feet I most definitely will recommend them

Always a fan of the old school Great pair of kicks very comfy Even had too get a matching pair for the Hubby I love it

Love these old school pumas any color been rocking them since back in the day comfort and style one of the best you can not go wrong on these kicks

Very nice comfortable and stylish casual sneaker

These are great Fit perfectly The price was awesome

these are the sneakers that started it all use to call them clydes back in the day you got leather and suede plenty of rich colors to say the least comfort second to none

THESE WERE THE FIRST PAIR OF PUMA SUEDE CLASSIC SHOES THAT I have EVER BOUGHT I LOVED THEM SO MUCH THAT I BOUGHT TWO MORE PAIR A COUPLE DAYS LATER VERY STYLISH AND EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE

The Puma shoe has always been my favorite since Junior High School I really needed a pair of purple sneakers and these are perfect PUMA always

These shoes do not need to be explain They match well with almost anything and fit comfortable

Purple must be in because I have gotten more compliments on these Puma Classic Suedes than a bride on her wedding day People DIG them The color combo is really poppin and just the right hues that keep it real for the guys They run a tad big and narrow but overall I highly recommend these super stylish kicks

Have Always been a big fan of these pumabest bang for your buck and look great with jeans or shorts

Great classic style with HIGH quality materials

I love these shoes remembered wearing Cortez when I was younger Got alot of Compliments from people

This shoe is so comfortable and goes well with the clothing that I wear now I am more into the slim more fitting clothing now and this is the perfect shoe to go with it I love these shoes

Awesome deal during the right time Able to sport with all my attire

These have been released In leather for their 45th anniversary so I wanted to get a pair just for the Nostalgia aspect Decent purchase because they are pretty cheap and relatively comfortable something you could use as an everyday sneaker to beat up

Whenever these get ran through I get another pair some colors

Purchased for my dad as they were his go to shoe in high school Could not have been a more perfect gift He wears them all the time now

I wear an 8 5 in mens and these run alil small Width is perfect but size wise my toes are right at the end of shoe But as I wear them they become alil more comfortable

Bought them for a friend that used to wear them in high school and just loved them Arrived fast and in good condition

When these shoes came they were so bright and I loved them However when I went to wear them they were very small Felt a half size smaller than other 13s Had to return then Price and appearance was great just need a half size bigger but none available

I had a pair of these shoes several years ago and I wanted another pair They are just as good as I remember

Ordered these on multiple occasions My husbandgo to shoe But this time the were pre worn and scuffed up So disappointed but we could not send them back because his other sneakers got destroyed so he had to keep them

I used to buy this all the time back in highschool in the 90s I do not remember them being so narrow

Got these shoes for a great deal so why not buy them These shoes are simple stylish and very comfortable

Finish line has great shoes and low price I would recommend them to everyone

Got these on sale Great price I have not worn them out of the house yet though

I purchased these for my son because he wanted this style and he was having an all white dance and I saw the deal for the shoes and I did not pass it up My son is super happy with his shoes

These shoes were out when I was a teenager We had a knick name for them I do not want to mention but they are as stylish and comfortable now as they were back then

One of the shoes must of been on display because it was dirty the inside of the sneaker has a slight yellow tint I have purchased 10 pair of sneakers from you guys and this is the first time I was disappointed Probably going to take a break

I absolutely love these shoes they are so light and insanely comfortable Bought them on a whim because I liked the style but I love them wear them all day

good product thank you finishline try to keep sales

Would like to buy another pair for back up or just to have for the weekend

Good looking shoe lightweight and comfortable Will probably buy another pair

Love these classics Slightly narrow Stylish and comfortable Definitely going to snatch another pair ASAP

Loved them Brand new with a nice fit and no problems with comfort I ordered the wrong size and I did not have any problems exchanging when i went into the location

I recommend going half a size up These fit very narrow and slightly small

I was disappointed to notice scratches on shoes I purchased brand new I almost returned them but needed to wear them the day after they arrived

Nike Cortez is one of my all time favorite shoes

i get compliments all the time Great product would recommend to anyone Stylish and extremely comfortable what more to ask for

I have a narrow and small foot usually wear a 8 8 1 2 I got these in a 8 1 2 and after 1 day could not bear to wear them as the toe is sooo narrow and tight it feels as if it is compressing the end of my foot I still have room at the toe just not on the sides I even went as far to loosen them as much as laces would allow and still no help If you get them you better order a wide as the would probably will not work well for most people I definately would never buy again

can not beat this deal A quality pair of summer shoes with the good weather coming around the corner Great deal

I have used this shoes for less than 5 months and already the sole of my left shoe is separating from the rest of the shoe it is really disappointing I have had nike before and never happened not even after many years I want to think it was just this pair that was defective because the use was pretty normal 3 days a week or less I would have expect them to last more especially with the use I give them Other than that they run small but after seizing up they fit perfectly very comfortable and stylish

Recently I have been trying to improve my life and make myself into a person I can be proud of I am not saying these shoes did that for me but when I wear them out I feel like a million dollars I originally wanted them because I was trying to care more about how I look and liked how simple they were but they still have the I wore these for a reason look to them Then I learned how much history there is behind the shoes My mom saw them and told me my dad would only ever wear Cortez I am originally from California but have been living in Arizona and Cortez definitely has a history from California and I feel like they are a nod to the fact that that is where I am from as well I am happy to have these shoes

I would definitely recommend these shoes Before you know it you will be hitting up your local arcade getting the high score on Galaga taking a long run with your Sony Walkman or playing Yars Revenge on your Atari 2600 with your best friends while listening to Judas Priest on your turntable Really though no matter what you do in these shoes you are going to look pretty righteous dude

Looks great on feet Pretty comfortable after I wore them all day First time I wore them they did feel a bit tight and bugged my toe but once I broke them in they felt great

The shoes fits true to size just slightly narrow Overall a very easy to break in shoe and very comfortable as well

This review is for the white pair with the black accents

The sizing of the cortez is very different from other Nike models You need to size up 0 5 inches if YOU HAVE WIDE FEET

Always found Nike to be a leader These smeakers are more than sports shoes They are amazing and stylish at the same time Wear them for gym workouts and also can wear them with jeans shorts and other street wear to always look and feel my best Great shoes

Comfortable Easy to coordinate Definitely would buy again We also call the shoe Money Making Mitchs in reference to the movie Paid In FullThe materiel does wear down easily though

Love the sneakers had them back in the day wish the leather was of better quality almost like a plastic material instantly creases after 1st wear but I love the retro color scheme that sold me

I have honestly been waiting for these to be rereleased and finally they are here Excited to have them in my collection so excited I a second pair My only complaint is that they run a tad bit small so you might want to go a half size up Other than that great summer shoe

How about the Waffle Trainers nex

Always great Comfort and style keeps up with the trends still to this day

Very nice and classic and it can go with anything

I recommend them to anyone that that has any knee problems because they are light comfortable and easy on your legs

Shoes go with anything they are a little narrow but other then that A 1

Nike is my favorite brand These shoes are very durable and comfortable and all at a great price 5 stars

the sneaker is very comfortable actually the first nikei have bought and they are more comfortable than any other sneaker i have had 5 stars

A very timeless classic good construction and actually decently comfortable

Great show to be stylish in or to be active Comfortable and durable I would say they fit true to size

Always a great shoe and very comfortable I have had a pair since i was about 8 Takes me back to the old days Before the dark times before the Empire

i wear them to work im on my feet for 12 hours with no problems

Really like the look and they are super comfortable Will get them again when these ware out

good looking causual shoes but not good choice for summer

Just like I remember them from when I was a kid Great memories

Nike is one of my favorite brand its very comfortable and stylish specially this one with white color

Love the red and white ones I have received many compliments towards them

I have purchased quite a few pair of Nike shoes and the Air Darwins are the most comfortable of all If they had more colors I would definitely buy more of these Very happy with my purchase

These are Dennis Rodmansignature from 1994 They are as durable now as they were back in 1994

Air Max are comfortable shoes you can wear all day Blue gold color way can not be beat

I need to get this is size 15 back in my day I had no problems buying shoes like these in my size all a sudden the size goes up to 12 or 13

Liked the style and look of shoe and people liked seeing them on my feet

These are definitely more of a casual shoe now a days They are still able to be played in but there are better options on the current market Cushioning was a bit firm traction is okay heel lockdown could have been better and the shoe overall is pretty stiff due to the large rubber outsole midsole

I have always been a fan of Penny and I always try to get every retro that is are released I was going to past on this but after seeing them in person I just had to get them They are very comfortable and the quality on them is by far the best My only complaint is that IMO they run kinda big

Lets be honest Nikeretroare not the best They either have poor quality super high offensive pricing or again poor quality However for 140 this is just right This is how I feel most retro Jordanshould be

When you get these shoes do not be shy to wear them at work 

The Air Max Penny was a sentimental purchase for me as it brings back memories of when Penny Hardaway was second only to some guy named Michael in the League

Looks good and feels even better they do run a lil big but other than that these shoes are a must have

I have just started wearing it so I am unable to comment on the durability

A little heavier then most but great support and very unique style

I have always been a fan of Air Max but not every shoe fits my wide flat feet But these on the other hand I love them I am on my feet all day an they are VERY comfortable Great for walking hiking at the gym an stylished enough to were out purchased All black just ordered second pair Black phantom blue green

Great design Great fit Overall Nike products are enjoyable for me This was no exception The cushioning is nice

Super light weight and comfortable kicks Easy to wear with jeans for a casual look or with gym clothes to work out

I was a little skeptical because when I think of Jordan I think basketball shoes but this is my third pair of Jordan running shoes and all have been great so far These are very lightweight but have good arch support when you put them on for such a light shoe They also do fit very snug and your foot feels nice and secure Liked them enough just bought another pair in white

This is apparently a training shoe and not a running shoe This is great if you want to do everything but running ie gym shoe but if you must run in this via treadmill Make sure it is not more than a 5k or else it is going to hurt

I love these shoes they are comfortable lightweight and they look amazing

These shoes fit well we are easy to put on and was surprisingly comfortable But let me do say that they need to work on the strap design they do not stick well across the shoe

Like 90 of the other reviews good look bad strap design Wore them for one game and the straps stopped sticking and just flailed around being annoy You might as well cut the straps if you want to keep the shoe

For the most part a great shoe however I found that the strap would not remain fixed so I had to keep are strapping them and after four months of playing twice a week the sole broke through To anyone reading this I would recommend the Lebron 10s their durability and straps are significantly better

I purchased these shoe for my kid not even 3 months later they are falling apart The sole is separating in the front of the shoes Too bad we are not like Zion where the execs can personally oversee the quality of our shoes

Amazing shoe Ive bought 3 pairs of these in the past month different colors but Worth every Penny No problem with straps staying at all The most comfortable shoe i have ever owned would HiGhLy reccomend these shoes to anyone i will be buying more color schemes for sure

Great for gym and other sports I have played with them

We are buying a shoes outside of the LeBron line for basketball this year

Love the shoe but was disappointed with the strap holster on the left side seems to be weak and feels like it will break if pulled to hard it is unfortunate that NIKE did not do a better job with this because the straps should as secure as shoe laces on these soliders

Granted they were from an outlet but only lasted a week shoes broke after the first quarter of the first game Horrible quality control and design by NIKE The inside strap has a robust molded loop The outside strap is this little thin cheap plastic piece of garbage major fail

Despite the shoes being very comfortable they are fragile Bought a pair and wore them twice and the strap broke it is a shame that they strap breaks fairly easy because they were some of the comfortable Soldiers that I have ever worn

The shoe felt great and had nice traction The problem happened on the second or third BBall play I cut and the plastic holder for the velcro strap broke making the shoesupport useless Had to reverse wrap the strap to keep the shoe on Very bad design The buckle holder should be metal wrapped rubber or fabric so it will not break at all Returning to get something better made

I ordered a pair and they arrived with a broken plastic strap loop So I sent them back for a replacement The same plastic clip on the new pair broke during my second basketball game it is odd to use such a fragile piece of plastic on a shoe named soldier that appears to be designed for a rugged basketball boot c and atmosphere

I had my soldier 12s for about 2 months and they are great No straps were broken and I play basketball almost everyday and the grip and lockdown is still extremely responsive One of the best sneakers I have played in

These shoes are comfortable and have good cushioning however the Velcro is extremely unreliable For any type of gameplay or intense practice they are unwearable because the straps keep coming loose Without the Velcro there is no ankle support I expected the straps to at least have some resistance but the slightest bend causes it to come undone

I was very excited to receive these shoes and wear to my AAU games practices Got my Customized pair ahead of schedule and wore to a very light practice the next day the inner foot side Plastic Strap loop broke while putting them on upon further review this is such a poor design The plastic loop should be replaced with metal steel loop Otherwise It would have never lasted a season NikeID get ready for lots of returns on this one I am very disappointed with the quality of the strap design and upset that I have to fund another pair while waiting on the refund Mom is angry will add photo later

I have been wearing this shoe for a while and they are extremely comfortable I would recommend this shoe to anyone who wants there feet to feel good

First off these are one of my favorite shoes ever They are with out a doubt one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet I am currently wearing these as a work shoe in them for 10 12 hours a day

I brought these shoes for my boyfriend for Valentineday He loved him He could not wait to wear them out Thanks Finish line and Nike first putting a smile on my babys face

Purchased these sneakers for my daughter At first they were super tight along the sides but we were table to take care of that problem The next problem we faced was that something happens with these sneakers and socks She always wears Nike Elite socks when she wears these sneakers These sneakers blow through the heels of the socks She has had this happen to SIX pairs of Nike Elite Socks We are going to try a couple different types of socks to see if anything works better We wold hate to have to send these back but ripping holes in the heels of socks is a huge problem

I think this is already one of my favorite Kobe shoes I have had multiple pairs of Kobe IX which have been my go to shoe for the last few years I have been hesitant to try another low though after I sprained my ankle and strained my achilles in a KDX I am really happy with how these NXT360s feel even after an hour or shooting around in them They are very stable and you feel very connected to the court and low which for a shooting guard is a big deal I think the small details on the shoe are really fun to look at and the detail on the drop in midsole are fantastic You are really buying this shoe for the midsole I think Overall I am very happy so far I have paid both more Kobe IX and less Kobe IIX for a basketball shoe and while this is on the high side I think that it is worth the money for the detail and thoughtfulness that went into the design I am excited to hoop in these and they are a really solid shoe One last note on sizing the toe box is fairly wide and allows your toes to really spread out whereas the back of the shoe around your mid foot and ankle tapers in for a tighter fit Once you wear them a bit and let them form to your foot I have no doubt they will feel great

I recommend ordering a half size smaller than your usual Nike shoe Fantastic cushioning insole keeps your foot steady with the grip and formation of the insole The flywire makes it feel as if it is another sock on your feet and makes it breathable I just wish the shoe laces were longer because I have just enough to tie a knot The traction has been fantastic moving in all directions I have been wearing hyperdunks for years but took a chance on my first kobe shoe I might order another pair for future use

Runs narrow and snug on feet I ordered a size larger than I usually wear but after about two weeks of wearing them they are extremely comfortable I can wear them all day unlike other shoes I stopped buying Nike shoes because of their poor quality and how uncomfortable they are compared to New Balances However I do not like rocking my gym shoes 24 7 and do not like looking like a dad at 22 So I bought these They are made out of nice materials and look awesome I got the whites with red blue accents I never thought I could stunt so hard on these hoes being a Caucasian male

I would like to start by saying I bought this shoe a full size up knowing that the 95s have been historically narrow and knowing that my feet are wide and they are still a pretty snug fit for my feet I think the shoe tongue design is especially detrimental since the tongue has a collar that extends around your foot further compressing it which adds to a slight sense of discomfort

Very classic shoe Could never go wrong with a pair

Love air max products Comfortable fit and lasts long

I love these Air Max 95 Denim because I have never seen like these denim material shoes I really love the material

I got my first air max Wasnt expecting too much because technology wise its made from the 90s I was surprised Because quality is perfect and its very comfortable

Love the shoe and feel when on feet No other shoe wraps and snugs the foot like 95s Would highly recommend to those looking for a stylish OG shoe with durability

I love my air max 95s I bought a pair back In 09 and wore them all the time for working out I weigh 230 and am very hard on them and they lived up to the challenge until now so I had to get another pair Im so glad nine are released this shoe

I have a narrow foot and these shoes are well paded and fit perfectly

Great shoe Love the colorway Would recommend to anyone

This shoe has been the best style of Airmax since they made them Long time fan and for years to come

Shoe fits true Clean and stylish I recommend this show to everybody looking for a cool walk around Nike air max shoe

I absolutely love Air Max 95 and these all white leather are awesome I have big wide feet and unfortunately these shoes fit small to size and are narrow so if I could get them in a size 16 wide or 15 wide that would be awesome I am a lifelong Nike fan and air max 95 are my all time favorite shoe and I love these just wish they fit a little better

Best sneakers I have ever bought Style and comfort these have it all

This has to be my favorite shoe of all And I have several air max and air Jordan This shoe not only feels good it looks good The 95 air max rocks The only thing I wish is that one day theyll come out with a kids shoe I would love to see my 3year old daughter with a pair on

This product is very comfortable fit long lasting and stylish Great for exercising

This is a very good looking and perfect comfortable shoes

Love the new look of the Air Max 95No only do they look good but they are extremely comfortable

Love the quality and the fit of the shoe Classic Blackout is a timeless shoe

This shoe perfect The sizing is a little tight but the quality is great

This show is very comfortable but have one flaw the bubbles pop easily so I do not recommend for outdoor use This is more for running indoors or over flat surfaces

This is a great shoe for working out and just wearing for a casual day

The air max 95 is a classic model the premium leather on this air max is great a perfect shoe for Independence Day or supporting our nation

Great color for this classic shoe Also has the peanut butter bottom

I have been running with these shows since they came out years and they still my go to

I love them just as much as the other ten or so pair I have owned since the original release in 1995

Very comfortable shoe I walked around Nashville for hours and never had an issue or any discomfort The colorway is really nice and the hidden 3m details were a nice touch I would highly recommend these for anyone that is a Air Max 95 fan

Love the Independence Day colorway goes great with most outfits and pretty comfortable Laces add a nice touch as well with the gold aglets

Worn out once The shoes were comfortable and fit snug like all 9

Love the gold tips and very comfortable one of the best airmax shoe made

Never has any pair of Air Max disappointed me Comfortable fit true to size awesome color way

This is a beautiful shoe perfectly executed a super comfortable The Premium version of the Air Max 95 runs slightly smaller than the standard model but is much more durable I wear 95as a lifestyle shoe and with so many color options there is no beating it I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone weather for running or casual wear Nike please bring this back to NikeID

Love the colorway designed for the shoes and the gum bottom makes it look like an limited edition airmax 95

This was a classic since birth probably about my 7th pair of air max 95and the still feel so comfortable and the pretty durable as well a must have for all sneaker heads

Always loved this shoe from 1995 and love it to this day Love Nike do not ban us beat us

This color way of the legendary air max 95 has to be one of my favorites The quality of the materials is superb which means that the shoe will have great longevity The 3M accents are a nice touch and really help your feet stand out in low light conditions The only complaint that I have is that the 3M stars on the sock liner are what seems to be stickers and I am pessimistic that they may fall off with normal wear I was hoping that they were going to be like the stars on the lace overlay Regardless you get a premium shoe that fits true to size and is sure to last you a good amount of time I would definitely recommend

The cushion is really good Very comfortable sneaker for training or everyday walking sneakers

The shoe looks great and feels great other than being a little narrow

I love how the quality of these sneakers and the endless amount of colors that they come in

I love this shoe From the way it fits to the way it looks

The best of the classic shoes from the Heavens I must say these are even more comfortable than the original version thanks you Nike for a wonderful product

This is honestly a great shoe I would really just wear these to work out and to also just chill

I order sneakers from Nike all the time These sneakers run pretty small compared to other Air Maxes retro and new I own I thought removing the insole for a week would help the sneakers stretch out but they have not really budged I bought these in grey and white The white ones feel more snug than the grey ones The toe box is pretty small on both I have narrow feet and wear running sneakers 95 of the time I wear sneakers Next time I know to avoid these

I loved the Air Max 95 when they came out Glad they have released them again Run true to size Perfect fit comfort and look to be very well made I just ordered two more to put on the shelf for when these wear out

I would recommend this pair of shoes as they are very comfortable and look good too

Good shoes must buy more from your company thanks in advance

I love nike because nike it is one of the best brand in the world

The 95 is the best air max of all time Super comfortable and stylish for any occasion The shank gives me a added boast1 air max 95 fan

Just purchased this pair and can not say how satisfied I am with the product I was already a big fan seeing the pictures online but the actual product is even better once you get your hands on it Fits great and feels very comfortable A MUST HAVE

Very comfortable and not that heavy Very breathable and provides great arch support Love these shoes

I searched and have tried a varied of products to provide comfort and support whether it was a short walk or logging on a 10 mile day I purchased my Air Max 95 a few months ago and I have been completely satisfied with them Additionally I have found that the shoe provides the needed support in joints and back that help enable me to get out and walk 2 3 miles at a time As someone who is diagnosed with a debilitating muscular skeletal disorder the additional support helps minimize additional strain and damageand allow me to work towards proving my mobility and endurance I strongly recommend this product for those who struggle with injuries and could benefit from the additional support to reduce impact

I was kind of skeptical on my purchase due to me nerve owning a pair of airmax and boy am I satisfied with my purchase

Always been a huge fan of Nike Air Max sneakers Great sneakers

I love them Fit very comfortable and appears to be durable

Perfect for anyone anybody ready for anything Great for running or dress shoe for jeans fresh 501Clean nike air max

I wore these shoes twice and the second time the fabric split right down the middle This is two orders in a row from nike Time to switch to the reeboks

I have other Air Max 95 sneakers and none of them fit like this version This new mostly all black sneaker is nice looking but the overall fit is strange The shoe is wide over the top of the foot but narrows alot at the toes Ordering a 1 2 size larger than your regular size may help with the cr and ed toes however the width of the shoe may tend to be too wide

Really comfy shoe I used to have the old ones back in the day Those were the days

This shoe is the best air max ever made IT IS SIMPLE BIT IT IS COLD aIR MAXES ARE THE BEST SHOES JUST TO WEAR PERIOD

The online picture is a nice light blue color air bubbles and lace ups the shoe I recieved has purple and yellow instead lace and purple air bubbles The shoe is a great shoe however the color is all wrong

Upon slipping these kicks on right away I was taken back to my cross country training days in high school this shoe was great for long distance training then as it is now Sometimes things get better with age and this is definitely proof of that

Only complaint is they run a LITTLE bit small

this are some good shoes but they run to small in size

I like the shoedefintley buy 1 2 size bigger than you would normally buyI paid postage x2

The shoe feels great on my feet Runs a little small though As with all Nike products it is build to last

The most comfortable awesome classic sneakers in the world

This grape colorway is awesome The shoe is very comfortable but be sure to try a half size bigger because they run a little small

Great shoes Great fit very comfortable but not as comfortable as the AirMax running shoes In the running shoes your feet feel floating not as much in these shoes Yet they are still very comfortable

Greatest sneaker ever made A sneaker classic for the ages



This is a pretty shoe Very nice and comfortable it is also cool looking

I was caught up in the hype and bought the neon green black grey shoe and was dissapointed with my purchase The dimensions of the shoe seems off and it is not comfortable in my honest opinion I highly value a combo of comfort and loos and for the shoe there is a compromise I had to buy inserts to deal with the hard ride this shoe provides It looks good at an angle but dead at 12 the toe box looks ugggglee this will sit dormant in my closet wish I bought another shoe

I have been wearing Air Max 95s for 15 years and Love them

i like these especially because they are blue i have purchased every single color thats come out this year Its very easy to match so its definitely a must if you love air max 95

Truly a one of a kind sneaker This is my 4th pair of Air Max 95s and I have to say this color combination is the best Very comfortbale and stylish

I loved these shoes when that came out in 95 I was really excited that they are out again

great shoes nice look i have all colors now neonorange red mint blue not good for running there only great for casual wear i will buy any other new colors that arrive

That have retroed it a few times and my favorite is the Neon Green but the colors are always slightly off The air bubbles seem to be not as comfortable this time around for Team Orange The Team Orange 95 is comfortable and supportive and the ankle and heel of the the shoe But at the front of the shoe eventhough there is Air there if feels kinda flat

Very comfortable good for running and walking I also love the style

This shoes is an instant classic a must have a this style never gets old which is why this keeps on coming back and this color way is one of my favorites

Trying to locate for a long time Excellent shoe and service

i lik this shoes

This is my 3rd pair of Air Max 95 and the build quality of this pair is subpar compared to the 2 older pairs I have The left shoe has a slight irregular shape and some of the threads are exposed

Love It these shoe is fire they very comfortable and they look great too

I wish Ithey had more colors to choose from but the white with lava is too fem for a dude

This is a very comfortable and stylish shoe The crocidile accents on the shoe make it different It goes with everything If you are looking for a black shoe that looks good and is comfortable this is the one

This shoe is defenitely a classic but I really wish that the new technology of the 360 air bubbles could be added onto the origional design All Black

These shoes fit small so make sure you get at least a half size bigger

Not quite as solid as the HOA but I was pleasantly surprised when they popped up on NDC

Great and classic shoe A well made retro of a popular named shoe



This is one of the all time favorites of many Nike customers and Nike did a great job again For the best fit you may want to go up 1 2 a size to have enough room since this is a narrow cut running shoe The traction and cushioning are great This will be a classic for many years to come

this color way brings back middle school memories no matter how much they change them from the originals they will always be one of my grails

THIS are are RETRO OF THE 1995 CLASSIC IS STILL COMPARABLE TO THE OGs ALTHOUGH A BIGGER AIR BUBBLE WOULD HELP JUST LIKE THE ORIGINALS I WISH THAT NIKE WILL NOT RELEASE SUCH CLASSICS AS QUICKSTRIKES OR EURO ASIA EXCLUSIVES SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO OWN A LEGENDARY SHOE WHETHER ON THE TRACK GYM OR SIMPLY CHILLIN THE NEON 95s WILL NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE

Marketing Dept PLS retro this colorway by far TOP 3 of the best colors for air max blue and cool grey as well very comfortable and stylish This colorway would be a shoe in to generate a large amount revenue since they are so rare i know i will buy 5 pairs

Please release this colorway again Very comfortable shoe very stylish and unique A great addition to your collection that has truly stood the test of time Simply put an instant classic

One of the best sneakers of all time Hopefully they are brought back again for us to purchase The gradient present on this shoe is spectacular and the neon accents truly separate this shoes from the many others Shoes fit great and feel amazing with the comfortable air bubbles pillowing your feet

I am a big fan of the Nike Air Max 95 I have almost every color made I wear mine mainly for style They are also very comfortable I really enjoy these shoes I would recommend them highly

Looks nice black blends with the white really well like the old school 95s very comfortable on the heal and arch Fits me just right

They look good and they came in a decent amount of time

Bought the shoes as a gift for someone I knew they loved this style so I started searching This person wanted the taupe ones however I decided to buy this color because they love RED When they opened the box they were so excited and they absolutely LOVED THEM

VEry comfortable And clean Look great and feel better

Shoe is nice and comfortable but it is not yellow and it is hard to match Citron is the color whatever that is overall a nice shoe but do not expect to match

The color on sight looks yellow maybe like a Steelers yellow but when I got the show I was disappointed in color

Got the pink natural colorway on the SNKRS app Arrived on time and the design and quality is amazing Very trendy and durable sneaker

Well made good quality Great looking shoe Seems a bit bulky for running Could get better with break in period

The size is too small it comes a little bit shorter and very narrow And it is not easy to wear it on

I puchased because I liked the style I ordered them in red but when they arrived they were orange apparently the lava red looks orange Although the box says orange the invoice says lava red They were not as comfortable as I thought but they will make for an off court shoe

They are very comfortable but im a woman wearing a mens shoe so the toe box should be big especiallly considering i have very narrow feet These shoes are very snug almost too tight Also if you have intentions on indoor court play the traction sucks Okay for casual wear tho i guess

These things are the most cofortible and stylish basketball shoes you could wear These are shoes I would ball in and just go out with my friends They have a nice style too 10 10

I think this is one of the shoes that looks very simple and cool when you wear it It has about 6 different colors and I bought the one which has black on the top and red at other parts Recently NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr wore these shoes and he really liked the design

This might be the worst case of advertisement ever Its shape pushes your feet to the front of the shoes abnormally The sole is as hard as it gets and not flexible enough for running TThe bottom of the sole is flat and it does not have a very good sole counter Ankles get sore quickly as it does not have a tongue or anything to wrap wound the ankle It can be a decent lifestyle shoe but running is strictly a no no

Really liked these shoes They are comfortable and have an interesting look to them

These shoes not only look great but they feel amazing as well I purchased the matching plush hoodie and heads turn every time I wear the combo

Was actually surprised at how much I like these shoes Actually loved them so much I bought in another color Very comfortable light weight and I think the unique design really stands out These are my everyday slip on and go pair of shoes I personally would not use these for working out or running You do not get any ankle support or any support to keep your foot in place I would recommend more for looks light walking or just a casual shoe Oh and for the price you get an awesome deal

I especially like that you can wear them comfortably without socks

My husband is a personal trainer so he has constantly in sneakers he wanted a pair for his off days and so we got these and he loves them Comfortable and stylish They are perfect

My 15 yr old son loves the style of the shoe But the comfort tops it off my son said its like walking on clouds

this shoes are the most comfortable shoe i ever bought and the price its just amazing pretty cheap and great quality love them

I bought these boot because they were on sale I am glad I did They are lite weight very comfortable and stylish I bought the Wheat Nubuck Timberlandalways seem to run big These were no exception Ordered a size 13 and had to return them for a size 12 The 12are a little wide but not to bad After wearing them at work for a couple days my feet are not sore like with some of my other boots Would like to order another pair but their out of 12 

Was afraid they would not fit cause I am a size 12 and they are a size 11 but they fit perfect and are so comfortable Very nice slides Well made and stylish Definitely worth the month Wish they had other colors now

Good product Recommend for everyone to get while they can especially at that price

very nice super comfortable to be with them all day can be used with any clothing

I love these shoes ltI would totally recommend them just keep in mind that they do run a bit big get half sz smaller then your regular size

the shoe quality is poor the front end of shoe started to peel off

I bought this for my brother as a gift he likes it so much it is very comfortable and the size is fit So I bought another to my another brother I really recommend these shoes

Very comfortable Very lightweight Looks good with casual street or athletic wear True to size But they form to your foot and feels so good on the arches of your foot One of the most slept on shoes by Nike

These shoes are sized large Also the foam needs to be black

This is a very good shoe with a great fit all the way around I purchased a pair in each color I loved them so much Good support and great cushioning and response on every step I am a big guy so I was supper surprised on the cushioning I love these shoes

These are great hiking boots with ankle support and retro styling Just have to ding it on quality because my pair came with some glue marks around it

This hiking shoe is THE hiking shoe I have been waiting for from adidas Super comfortable lightweight water resistant The BEST hiking shoe in my opinion Adidas has ever made I own a lawn mowing company and mow about 50 yards a week I need high comfort I need durability I need support These shoes fill the bill on on fronts I also can go right from work directly to a 3 5 mile dog hike without changing shoes DEFINITELY SIZE DOWN AT LEAST A HALF SIZE TO WHAT YOU NORMALLY WEAR For whatever reason these run very large I went with a half size down with my current pair and it is still a hair big I am sizing down a full size with my next pair To AdidasPLEASE more colors please Black shoe black sole with white adidas stripes would be PERFECT I would by 10 pair RIGHT NOW if you would make this color

Took these Easter weekend to the Guadalupe Mountains for Hunters Peak the Bowl and Bear Canyon trails could not have been more pleased with comfort and ankle protection My legs were sore at the end of the day but not my feet Great purchase

Purchased these for my boyfriend since he is been having foot muscle pains for a few weeks and I wanted to start hiking once a week regularly It was tough to find a hiking shoe that was stylish comfortable flexible and durable since most other hiking shoes are bulky heavy and stiff When I stumbled across these I was ecstatic While they fit him a half size too big he found that to be a good fit considering the foot pains he is been having We took them out for brief walk a few days ago and he had nothing but positive things to rave about the shoe Needless to say we are both looking into purchasing another pair in the future when a new color way drops

They run 1 2 size big very lightweight sock like feel but durable One issue I have noticed is that on trail descents I notice that my foot slides forward to the front of the shoe No real issue yet curious if others have experienced this Might need to tie them tighter

great size and fit for the shoe love the boost and sock like fit

could not wait for these to release Was tired of the clunky hiking boot Take them out hiking every weekend and my feet are thanking me Would love these with a Goretex coating but I will take the water resistance

Everything about this shoe screams quality and performance From the continental rubber outsole with insane traction To the full boost midsole To the water resistant prime knit upper Absolutely love these shoes

Size runs slightly larger on the toe box area but the angle support is extremely good The shoe itself is super comfortable even as a everyday shoe In fact I find it to be more comfortable than the Ultraboost for my particular foot size I like it so much now I am now considering investing in a second pair as a backup

Order a half to maybe even a full size smaller than what you normally wear in NMDs and ultra boost

If comfort matters then get these hikers After hours of hiking the boost kicks in to give you that extra response that you need to finish

While the shoe comes in a little large get either a half or full size down nice to have a large toe box Padding around the ankle area and super comfortable due to boost Very happy with my purchase

Perfect bootused it on the Bataan Death March this yearonly issue is squeaky nature on tile floor

I am so disappointed These hiking shoes seem perfect and should be for the price Unfortunately there is stiff uncomfortable stitching that puts pressure on the ankle bone This will undoubtedly become uncomfortable on long days

Feels comfortable and perfect for the trails and rainy days

Normally wear 11 5 in NMD and UB shoes I got 11 5s in the Terrex Free Hikers They ran quite big there is a lot of extra room in the toe box and this was with a normal to slightly thicker sock I ordered the 11to see if that will solve the issue

This Terrex Free Hiker exceeded my expectations in every aspect They look great on foot first off They are short comfortable the padding in the heel and Achilles area set this apart from all the other high top hikers I have worn previously That area locks you down but at the same time allows for movement does not hold you back I have not found that in any other high top hiker it is usually one or the other is either restrictive or ur sliding around unstable Anyone looking for a comfortable light hiking shoe you have found it with the Adidas Free Hiker I wish I had the chance to get the other colorway but I will settle for what they had

Boost technology Stylish Gortex 3d knitting I would definitely recommend to a friend

great shoes for hiking up any type of mountain also very durable

Got these shoes as a gift during Christmas it is February and the strap on the side that covers ankle ripped and tore off Disappointed As an UA Fan last few ball shoes have been horrible

I wish I could give these 0 stars I have bought under armor basketball shoes for my kids in the past and never had a problem until now These are HORRIBLE My daughter and her hs team bought these and the shoes have cracked big toe nails and bruised their feet We even returned them for a larger size and that did not help

I was very excited when I received these shoes for Christmas I had heard great things about them When I tried them on I noticed they were very comfortable but when I played in them for the first time I thought otherwise After an hour of playing basketball I had blisters on my pinky toe and ankle I thought I might just need to break them in but the same thing happened the second I time They are well cushioned on the inside but leave bad blisters

I got these shoes for basketball After wearing them a few times indoors only the sole was coming off the shoe Very disappointed in the quality or lack thereof of these shoes

These shoes are super light and fit true to size The top around the ankles need some breaking in but playing basketball i felt they improve my game I can stop on a dime and change directions faster I can not give these shoes enough praise They are so comfortable and look great and came on time Expect the best with this company

I bought this shoes for my daughter and its better than curry shoes highly recommended good grip and ankle support

Just got these and have worn them a handful of times They are a firm soft more like the Sonic vs the PhantomI use them mostly for Circuit training and weight lifting but great give and bounce when used for basketball They do run small I wear a 13 and had to go up to a 13 5 Keep that in mind I could of kept the 13but why be uncomfortable

was not from a sock and was not the insert

My husband absolutely loves the Gel Numbus 20 I have purchased two pair for him so far and will probably buy more soon He has flat feet and these shoes provide him with the most comfort he will probably never buy anything else again

Love Asics but sizes are off Ordered a 12 because that was my previous Asic running shoe I bought last year Too tight I will are order this shoe in a 12 5 if they ever get me my refund money They have had the return back for 7 days

are not as wide in the toe box as other 2E I have bought there

I wear 2E width shoes and finding some that are super comfortable is hard but the Gel Nimbus knock it out of the park Great shoe for working out and running

I only wear Asics Nimbus and buy 3 pairs a year This pair is going to be tougher to break in so I will wait until the 21 model yo buy my second two pairs

I have been wearing the nimbus line for about 10 years This shoe is probably my favorite pair Fits my feet perfect Would recommend for sure

I bought this a monthy ago there shoes are not as cushy as the Gel Nimbus 18I last purchased Those felt like I was running walking oin clouds these not suo much Hope they do the job though even if they are not immeditely as seemingly as comfortable or supportive

Now with the resizing you have RUINED them Please bring back the older wider fit PLEASE You are losing this loyal customer

Very nice Just wore them to run Still wearing them now

I buy Asics all the time but this is the first time I bought this style I wanted more structure at the toe These definitely have that They are a lot less comfortable than other style Asics that I have bought They also feel about 1 2 size smaller than the other Asics I have purchased

No comment on the performance characteristics of the shoe Just the same old story with ASICS you never know what size you need I normally wear a 12 ordered a 12 5 and ended up needing a 13 I do not get it

I have been a life long runner skier soccer player and cyclist I have been greatly devoid of any serious injury because I take the time to find gear that works Once you find what works for you just stick with it The Asics GEL Nimbus has evolved ever so slightly over the years but for me the 2E wide fit and the toe box has been reliable and the fit and finish of the upper and lower have not let me down Extremely comfortable breathable and livable on long runs or short jaunts at the gym I always buy 2 3 pair a year to make sure I can have one for the following season should anything change My only regret is not getting an extra pair of my favorite color from a prior generation to wear casually hopefully Asics will bring back some better colors for Wide 2E sizes But the 20 in all black is pretty cool Maybe a nice Navy and Gold for us Cal BearsNo better shoe for this normal active guy

charlie

Have done two 6 miles runs and they feel real good Will be using june 2 for Navy 10nm

I had to return cause It said New an improved fit an 13 was to big now need 12

would like to see better colors

I love this shoe I order three different colors and 3 of each I like to 20 and not the 21 yet

I have worn this series since the Nimbus 12s Honestly Asics should scrap the new developments and go back to the Nimbus 17 That was the best shoe they ever developed Everything now feels cheap and does not fit as well

Ever since buying these a week ago I have been able to tack on an extra mile to my daily running regiment Since 2005 I would only buy the ASICS GT models and I wanted to try a shoe that was made for longer distance running I am very happy with The ASICS Nimbus model and I recommend them to any runner looking to take their training to the next level

About 4 years ago I developed Plantar Fasciitis from running in some older shoes gaining weight and not having ran in a while Tried multiple brands and the Gel Nimbus are the only ones that have eliminated the heel pain when running If your heavier like I am but still want to run and get in shape this is great shoe This is the third pair of Gel Nimbus shoes that I have had and I will buy another pair when mine give out

I bought the nimbus 20 after my other nimbus shoes were worn down I love the improved fit the cushion is just right and the shoe laces are also amazing they are tight but comfortable I love running in this 20

This is a great shoe for wide foot I have tried almost all of them Adequate cushion making things easier on the knees I have had this shoe going back five or six model Unfortunately there is never more than one color alternative the 19 was gray now the 20 is black I get they probably do limited runs but it was be nice for us wide feet people to get something less drab every now and then Functionally a great shoe just boring appearance

This has been my go to running shoe for 8 generations now When the Nimbus 16 or 17 came out I had to move up a half size This version 20 has me moving back a half size Not a big deal unless of course you bought through the mail and now have to return them for smaller size

Great shoes soft plush smooth Great for long runs

I can run 9 miles for 2 or more consecutive days without developing any blisters or having my nail beds turning red

Wonderful shoe I put it on the first time and walked a mile up and down steep hills The fit was perfect and there was no break in time

Buying Asics for years Love them for my moderate running Great fit for me Love Nimbus durable product

It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I am 86

I have bought nimbus shoes for several years now and I am very disappointed they design has been changed These do not fit me

After using the Nimbus 20 I can say they are wonderful I had previously Nossa Tri 8 10 and 11 and these Nimbus 20 are better for long distances They are so confortable and have a good cushion in the sole

I have been buying the Nimbus shoes for years Because I officiate soccer and need to have an all black shoes I purchased 3 pairs and they have saved my knees when running over 28 miles per week These are a must if you are running

I have worn Nike for 30 years and increasingly over that time I have noticed a decline in their quality and comfort Recently I visited a mall with numerous other shoe sellers Nike Adidas Puma Reebok etc I literally tried them all and came away disappointed Then my sister recommended the Asics Amazing Being older my feet are not what they used to be but these shoes make my feet feel ten years younger Thank you

I bought ASICS GEL NImbus 20 2E T801N 9001 I regret buying this shoe it is narrow at the toes literally toe crushing quite painful to walk around in these shoes I purchased wide hoping it would be comfortable I would not recommend ASICS shoes to anyone extremely uncomfortable and painful at the toes I did not wear them for more than a day

Bought these cause they were listed on a website that they are good for plantar fasciitis I have been able to walk with very little discomfort because of these shoes

I bought them two weeks ago and I am still having problems with right insole not fitting right at the arch I only buy the nimbus and have never had this issue Maybe it just was not cut right

I bought these a couple weeks ago to use for Volleyball and Basketball season The comfort was noticeable immediately and feels great to walk run in

I have been wearing Gel Nimbus since I can remember These fit and fell great I normally go through at least a pair of running shoes a year and always go with these

Have bought the Gel Nimbus for years and loved them This pair looked ok but after wearing once a wrinkle in upper area back heel developed caused blister 2nd pair ordered did the same

I used Asics 12 14 15 16 and with last shoes they did something horribly wrong When I run it just hurts I do long runs and you can feel the difference in cusioning Size is also smaller and narrow in compare with oldest versions

Perfect fit for my custom orthotics and comfy for casual use Heel area of outsole was really stiff at first but has softened and or I have gotten used to it Runs true to size with other athletic shoes

I bought my first pair in Florida while we on vacation They were so comfortable that I wanted another pair in a different color

These shoes are super comfortable Believe in their gel technology the ride begins to feel squishy after a few miles but nothing that interrupts the run

Great shoe Perfect for a big guy I will always buy ASICS now

This is the 4th pair of Nimbus that I have owned starting with the 19Love these shoes I started wearing them after issues with Achilles tendonitis I have upped my miles and never had an issue with Nimbus shoes

Listen I hate running I hate cardio in general but sometimes it is not because the action or the movement it is because my feet hurt I am not gonna say it is like walking on a cloud in heaven or that it is a spa day while running the Boston marathon These shoes work for me as a person that hates running I would happily run for survival but since zombies are fake and bears are wusses I will happily walk in these shoes all day every day until a zombear appears then I may skip away from the problem

Not as good as previous versions and runs short and narrow

ExampleI bought this a month ago and am so happy that I did

I order two different sizes with 2nd being a wider version I canceled both It appears that your shoes are now more narrow than they used to be I order a wide version of Brooks as much more comfortable and better fit

I work 12hour shifts as a nurse and have gotten really bad foot back pain in the past few years I also have neutral high arches that require really good support I got the Gel Nimbus 18and loved them Got the 20after more than a year and love them also Great arch support and heel shock absorption definitely what I needed I did have to size up 1 2 a size from my Gel Nimbus 18Love them

Bought them for work and can not get through a shift with my feet hurting for a couple days after I have gone back to my older cheaper ASICS

I bought these a few days ago due to fact they are a neutral running shoe and these are hands down 5 stars in all compartments First day I spent just walking around parks but after the break in I began running 5 10kms without any hot spots lots of springy cushion for every step taken and they look great they are a great bang for your buck I can not quite comment on the durability just yet but I am sure due to the long track record of the previous Asics shoes they will hold up just fine

I work as a letter carrier and they lasted about 4 months that is on my feet walking etc 8 hrs a day800miles I am about 75 pounds overweight and my feet never hurt with this shoe Zero blisters You get what you pay for Its worth your health All black model is great when work requires all black shoes Just purchased a second pair

Purchased a pair size 11 Same size as the other six pairs of ASICS I have Worst fit ever Too narrow and small Very disappointed

With my arthritis starting to limit my walking distance because of increasing pain in my hip and knee what I needed was a cushioned and comfortable running shoe that would take the impact shock out of my leg joints This running shoe is by far the most comfortable and cushioned shoe I have ever worn I do not expect a shoe to heal or cure joint pain but a good shoe can be like a medicine and this one is

Asics has always been my favorite brand of sport shoe The Gel Nimbus 20 is comfortable on my feet Keep up the good work

I bought these as I have a simular pair for the gym I paid extra and went the distance thinking they would have even more cushion

Just started wearing them this week four hours a day Had a knee replacement so foot swells

I bought this shoe the other day was have been very impressed with the fitment and cushioning

The 20s are very narrow width wise and seem to be cut smaller

I bought these a couple weeks ago Fit is perfect and comfort is great Only dissappointment is they have whay aopears to be a dark purple gel heel The color said black carbon which to me would have been solid black with some grey trim which it does but the gel heel looks purple in the light I noticed some of the black ones in the stores also have a purple hue Not sure if this was on purpose or it is the materials dye lot

The 20 is not as supportive and comfortable as the 19

After the fit fiasco that was the Nimbus 19 I bought as many Gel Nimbus 18 pairs on sale as I could afford So when the Nimbus 20 was billed as having an improved fit I was very curious to see how Asics had changed things for the better

RET800N Vietnam size 13US F451117 PV

I am a ICU nurse and am on my feet 12 hours a day I got these because my MD suggested them and man was he right Leg pain and back pain diminished Go up a half size I read the other reviews and it sounded like they ran a half small So I went up a half They fit beautifully Great shoes If I was still in the military I would love these for running

I am a big guy 300lbs so I have to have comfortable shoes The Nimbus 20 is the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Thank you Asics

These shoes have great forefoot and heel cushion which is important for underpronators and neutral runners Lining is soft and fits like a sock I also like the heel not being too high Adidas Supernova I had before them had the heel too high and lacked good forefoot cushion both of which could lead to injuries

do not run out of the best colors so fast Especially at the flagship store

Nicely cushioned shoes for those long runs Its like running on pillows

I have been buying only the Gel Nimbus for ten years My last pair were the17 version and they were great as usual This new pair is horrible They pinch the front of my foot and rub the bottoms of my feet raw Not sure what they changed but they need to change it back to what is was before

Always consistently GREAT Will continue to keep buying ASICS

good shoe i had to step up a full size from the 18i had

I have been wearing the nimbus almost since it came out Always have worn a 12 until the 19 and 20 came out I am now a size 13 according to Asics The toebox is larger than the 19 which is better

Incredibly pleased with the GEL Nimbus 20 I was anxious to see how the improved fit of the 20 would work for me and they are perfect I have about 50 miles on mine and I just love them Amazing support structure and comfort Well done

I bought them about two weeks ago they are just great Nice color and nice style

Purchased at Road Runner Sports in Albany CA to wear as my daily commuters Fantastic running shoes Wide enough for my wide feet big arches I do think that the toe box is a tiny bit narrow for Asics but it is fine for me I would buy them again

Just recently received these Thank you for changing the fitting More true to ASICS old school feel

After I weared down my Nimbus 16 totaly purchased this20 Excellent running shoe Good investment

Have always liked ASICS had a return due to the wrong size and they took care of it with no issues

Had been looking for Gel Nimbus in Solid Black due to working in Law Enforcement Most comfortable shoe for prolong standing Own other pairs of Gel Nimbus that I wear around the house and to work out

Why not back to 17 It was the best Everybody was so happy with him I think a lot of nimbus users are disappointed it does not fit well especially on toe box sorry

I bought these because I am SO happy with my old ASICS running shoes These shoes are SO comfortable for walking and since they are all black I can wear them with casual clothes

I am a Asics only shoe person Every time I have tried something elseI always go back to Asics The only disappointment I have with the Nimbus is I prefer more cushion at the front of my footthe Nimbus does not have as much I some of the other Asic shoes

The 20 is still too narrow and seems shorter also Have been wearing the Nimbus for 18 years or so and the last good fit was the Nimbus 17 I do not see many 4E choices if any at all Guess I will be moving on to another shoe maker

I have been wearing the asics numbus model for years going back to version 11 I have always loved the fit and incredible cushioning Asics really messed up the sizing on version 19 as was pointed out by numerous reviewers I generally wear a medium width and sometimes even a narrow in certain shoes and had to go to a 4E width on version 19 for it to feel comfortable I was very excited when version 20 was supposed to have an improved fit and was hoping it would feel like my previous versions I do agree that version 20 is not as tight as version 19 which was unwearable but it still does not fit right in my opinion I usually am a 15 would and this size still feels way too tight particularly in the toe box My toes are jamming against the edges of the shoe and feel compressed My heel also feels as if it is crossing over the back edge of the foot bed making me think the shoe is too narrow I tried on the 15 2E although I have never had to wear a wide shoe in my life it felt a bit better in the toe area but the rest of the shoe feels just that too wide On the positive side it is a lightweight shoe with very good cushioning If one is able to go up a 1 2 size I would definitely suggest this that is a problem however when you are a size 15 and there is no size 15 and 1 2 only a size 16 which is way too big Overall there are some positive aspects to the shoe but in my opinion the sizing is still way off and nothing like all the previous models I have come to adore I will be trying on other brands now for sure

GEL Nimbus 20 is very comfortable with good cushioning It fits perfectly in my usual size unlike recent Nimbus models that were unexpectedly too tight Fit is now equivalent to my old Nimbus 16 

Lov these toe box bac to normal fit i work asics outlet standin all day on gard floors an feet felt alot better after my shift Orderedsecond pair all black should nice thankx asics

This is my 5 pair of new nimbus shoes I love the style and most of all the comfort Best shoes out ther

I have used Asics gels for years This is another good one

positive support

Fits half size short and a bit narrow Still love Asics though

Got my new nimbus 20s and fit was much better then 19s but something felt different took out insole and discovered it is half as thick as old ones i do not know why you had to change that but it definetly is less springy please stop trying to save weight on these shoes now I have to go buy insoles

Much improved shoe To many dark colors Lots of black

I bought this for my boyfriend as a anniversary gift and he loves it so much

I love the all black design they cane out with I have the best of both worlds work and running shoe combined

Have always purchased Cumulus for width and arch support The 20 has no arch support Shoe is so soft and flexible that it has become unstable This is my last pair

Very comfortable shoe for folks with PlantarUnfortunately Asics has not figured out what good colors are for sneakers yet Selection very limited Great shoe none the less

The nimbus series is on my favorite high cushioned running shoes It does not feel sloppy soft but supportive and has amazing impact protection On my longer runs the nimbus is one of my first choices It is slightly heavier than some shoes but I can run a strong effort in this and feel fresh the next day

What a disappointment Bought 2 pairs on release returned both the same day Both my wife and myself have multiple pairs of vapormax shoes since the introduction that we love These definitely missed the mark The materials are awful and it is not even a snug fit I think trying to work out in these would be painful Stick with a flyknit pair and save the headache

it is embarrassed to go back to the 90 styles for 2019 I used to buy a lot Nikebut not this time

Nice shoes but really small I actually had to return a sz 13 for a 14 because they were so tight I then held the sz 14 up to another pair of vapormax I bought last year and the old sz 13 was the same length as the new sz 14 So strange Now the sz 14 feels ok but not the same fit I am used to Midsole bubble hurts on my left foot hoping I just need to break them in

I have a pair of the 2019 Vapormax and the Knitfly 2

was not sure if these were ok to exercise in so I asked in the store Guy at the store said these are fine for working out They are very uncomfortable Shoelaces become untied and sole feels awkward Too bad I cant return now

The shoes is not only aesthetically pleasing but comfortable as well They look amazing and feel great on foot These shoes are awesome

colorClub Gold Ember Glow Metallic Silver Light Cream

I love the look of the shoe but after trying them on and walking around a little bit it felt like walking on individual rocks as you can feel nearly each and every air bubble pushing into your foot The Nike insert is way to thin to prevent this 3rd party gel inserts could help prevent soreness but even then the rock feeling is not completely eliminated

I have had 3 back surgeries and I wear the most comfortable shoe I can Nike Air is def it I just bought my VaporMax and I am def really happy

This version of the VaporMax runs unbelievably small They are nowhere near as comfortable as the previous versions of the VaporMax I have purchased numerous pairs of the previous versions and was really looking forward to the new version Unfortunately Nike missed the mark I will now have to try to find the old version in my size Nikethe VaporMax is one of my favorite shoesplease work on this design and bring the magic back to the VaporMax

Its nice but it could be more comfortable in the front

could not resist these as a throwback to 20 years ago Remember buying these when my kids where just toddlers and we had matching shoes

I love all the old school shoes and these were on my Get List Had to have them

Bought the shoe as a bday gift and they love it will buy again

I love the sneakers and everything but they are not good for wearing all day they will give you blisters on the back of your foot above your heel sorry i have to be honest but i love the sneakers no matter what

Very clean classic shoe but is a little uncomfortable after wearing for a long period of time After all they are still filalol VERY NICE CLASSIC

Good product comfortable and look nice

Purchased due to reviews on how comfortable they are And the reviews gold TRUE Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned Getting ready to purchase another pair of the ultraboost laceless

I bought these shoes for my son and he loves them

This shoe is sexy and comfy its like walking on a cloud

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever owned Love the color

The shoe is so comfortable when running playing sports or just going on a walk I have been wearing this shoe non stop since I got it in February I have had no problems with this shoe and all I have to say is that this shoe will forever be my gym shoe If i grow out of it I will buy a new one

Probably the most comfortable shoe ive ever had I love it

I had heard Ultraboostwere great shoes so I decided to try them out even if they are a bit expensive it is safe to say these are the best running shoes I have had in years Great fit and comfort and great build quality Only thing is on the site it says to order a half size up so I did I had to exchange them for my true size so keep that in mind

You can run and walk comfortably everywhere you go

The best and most comfortable shoes Would recommend

Love the Ultra Boost generally but the color was off here compared to the website The site shows the mesh as white while in person it has a very light but definite pink tone Not bad just needs to be shown more clearly on the site

Super comfy shoes great for long days on my feet

According to the chart this shoe should be a True to Size Fit or slightly big In my case it is not for the shoe to somewhat fit better I must have the inserts out Which is not really a bid deal cause it has the same padding as an NMD does However without the insert in there the shoe is slightly uncomfortable I am taking a guess with more wear the shoe may stretch out And if it does then the shoe will have a better fit But if you like to have the insert in I am guessing you should go a half size up Next time I buy a pair I will make sure I go to the store and try my size on again or a different size Other than that I really like the color of the shoe

It is extremely comfortable to wear and it give you all the support you need for everyday wear

If there was one shoe to wear every day this would be my selection Second pair and would love to have a lifetime supply of them

I love these shoes as soon as i got them fit nice and snug right out of the box All white does get dirty easily though so i recommend to keep good care of them Once again one of the best shoes I have ever had and will gladly buy another when needed

Got them for my mom she loves them Must comfortable shoes she has

these shoes are great I recommend them to anyone

The shoe has a great fit the design is unique and dope then it just has really great support

I bought my regular size too tight After 3 hours of wearing my feet got tired and sweaty I would recommend to go 1 2 size up I hope i can returned from where i bought them

Big fan of them The color way is one of the best and worth the money

I love these shoes I ordered them a few weeks ago and was a little concerned i was going to get ripped off I definitely did not though I have had these shoes for about one month now and have not had a single problem Normally by now my shoes are torn up but i do not even have a hole starting yet I do think that they are maybe 20 bucks too much but I would still say it was worth the money These shoes are also really comfortable every where Very satisfied Keep up the good work Adidas

Flexible yet great support Extremely comfortable

extremely comfortable and light i feel barefoot

Most comfortable shoes I have had in a long time and recommend all day long

Really comfy shoe length is perfect but a bit narrow until break in

Excellent comfort and really good looking shoes Just got them but they do run a little tight since they are running shoes Recommend buying half a size bigger for a perfect fit

Very comfortable but start seeing prime net start ripping I wish they were more durable started seeing the the strings after a month and I take very good care of these shoe

Picked these up during Boost week after missing out during the initial release As per usual with my wider feet I had to order a half size larger which works perfect They look great and are comfortable as usual

The quality is a very good one and the weight is also

This is best shoes ever that I have with adidas My feet do not get hurt at all as my back

They are everything ppl say they are Super comfortable very stylish and awesome quality The multi color i got are brighter on the upper than the pics but i do not mind Hopefully these do not temp me to start collecting

Love it Light weight and great looks Easy to slip into and good ventilation

I decided to drop the bucket and splurge on shoes for the first time I am glad I did These shoes are extremely comfortable These are well worth the money They fit to size but I feel like if I wanted a little more wiggle room I would size up 0 5

I liked the product and they quick shipping They were so comfortable as my mom said it these feel good Just absolutely amazing

This shoe is great I wear it to school on a regular basis but also wear it to the gym making it a good all around shoe It is comfortable and looks great The white speckles in the black are a nice touch

Love my ultra boost but have to return these for a bigger size I usually use 9 1 2 but for some reason 9 1 2 in DB3197 are too small so i had to exchange them for size 10

Great for casual wear and at the gym Comfort and look are spot on

They are very comfortable and did not fail to disappoint One of the best Adidas sneakers I have gotten

Ultraboost are my favorite adidas model They are the most comfortable shoes

I was excited to get this shoe I have another Ultra Boost that I wear all the time so decided to buy 3 more this is the first one that came in the ordertried it on when i took it off the sole came out on both the shoes I cannot think that I have to are insert the sole every time I take of the shoes I really hope the quality has not gone down since I purchased my original pair At these prices the shoes cannot have any defect or people will return them

Congratulations you are looking at Adidabest running shoe I have had this shoe for over a year and I have easily put over 50k miles on it This shoe is the perfect balance between performance and comfort I will be buying 2 more pairs once I am done with the ones i have currently Just take a look they are always sold out

Look as cool as my kids and they think I am pretty hip

I am so love it I usally hurt my feet cause no any shoes fit for me Only adidas can make me happy ever Thank for adidas making a good shoes for us

This pair of shoes are one of my favorite They have the boost comfort on top of the good looking shoe

I like this because it is comfortable and looks nice performs great for running

Very comfortable easy to slip on Looks great feels great

Anytime I get a chance to buy an Ultraboost with a black or grey sole I always jump at the opportunity I hate watching the white boost get dirty These will not have that problem

Amazing comfort for people with arthritis and gout PrimeKnit once broken in will always give you the perfect amount of stretch without feeling constricting and yet gives you enough support UB soles are the most comfortable soles on the market and feels like you are walking on a cloud

3 I wish the boost letters on the inner sole were a black fabric not a black sticker so then they would stay on

WarningFor Adidas I go 0 5 size lower when I got these UBit was pretty tight but after breaking them in it is much better Just a heads up on that

super comfortable i rely like the shoes the best shoes you can buy

The ultraboost is a firm and comfortable shoe to use in all avenues of life

I bought it for my dad The boost supports his body which prevents some hurt for his knees

I do think they are a little overpriced otherwise I would recommend them far more frequently But they are a great sneaker and super comfortable

Because they are super comfortable Also they look so nice and clean

Have to remove insoles for shoe to fit size 13 otherwise toebox is cr and ed

Great shoes Super comfortable great for performance great for anything

Great shoe fits great and super comfortable Would recommend to anyone

I like how easily it is to slip on and off the shoes Walked around all day in them and my feet still felt good The one to one feel was just snug enough where it felt comfortable and not uncomfortable

Looks good but tight in the front so hurts the toes

These shoes are truly worth the hype Everything about them that people say is true The comfort is really something to be noted easily the most comftorable shoes i have ever worn The material is made of flyknit so they give your feet a good amount of breathing room Except for when they do not If you have wide feet i would recommend going half a size up as opposed to TTS The shoes are narrow and were hugging my feet at my regular shoe size Going half a size up almost immediately fixed that problem however and now they are nearly perfect Besides that the sole is fantastic the laces are surprisingly high quality actually I really enjoyed how solid they felt compared to other shoes I wear The outsole is great as well much better than the Ultraboost 1 0 and the shoe itself looks great assuming you have the right colors In my opinion some of them are either too boring or too bright but that is for you to decide Anyone that is thinking about these shoes should definitely consider them they truly are great

Most comfortable long distance running shoe I have had multiple pairs and still wear all of them

This is the best running walking shoe I have ever owned I was skeptical due to all the hype around the shoe but was pleasantly surprised at the cushion and durability

Love running in my Ultraboosts So comfortable makes running more enjoyable

Ultraboosts in general are super comfortable The shoes have enough bounce in them to keep you going and the quality of the shoes are amazing 10 10 would recommend

I would like addidas to provide a new replaceable continental rubber sole as mine has worn out pretty quickly rest everything is great

I got these shoes specifically for running because i heard they were great and really comfortable After i started running a lot i started getting really bad shin splints that i never had from other shoes They do not have enough support If you are buying these for running I recommend looking at other options Otherwise for walking and everyday use they are extremely comfortable

I work retail and I am on my feet for 45 hours a week These shoes are great on my feet knees and back I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for comfortable sneakers They are so good I have repurchased them just as a a backup

It was great and comfortable although while running sometimes my foot goes off the sole

It had a great fit and it was very comfortable fit

You love ultraboost but the cage is bothering youthis is the one

I like the product it is so comfortable and the Primeknit is also really comfortable

If you are looking for a great shoe with excellent quality and comfort the Ultraboost is the shoe for you it is amazing in every aspect of it but I would recommend buying half a size up

Huge UB fan and this colorway just kills it If you have not worn the UB its a must and this is a good pair to start with

This is by far my new favorite shoe Great fit and super comfortable

I bought these online reading by some reviewers that I should have bought them a size larger I am very happy with the way they are made and how lightweight they are I will take them into the store even though I bought them online and go a size larger I know I will be happy with them They are very well made and I know I will be pleased with them for years to come

Minimalist shoe reduced to the essential Comfort maximized Nice sock foam Sole problem is too narrow at the toes should be wider I am a true 10 5 and these are 10 5 Some people say to go up half a size but I disagree

It is an awesome shoe but get a half size up because it is kind of like a sock so it is a tad tight

True to size looks great and incredible comfort can not go wrong

I like these shoes and for me they fit true to size The material is stretchy like a sock almost And if you pinch the foam on the outsole it will conform a little The uncaged are way more comfortable in my opinion I noticed after a 2 weeks of running the shoes loosened a tad bit nothing major

Great Shoe Hands down one of my favorite purchases from Adidas Very comfortable and supportive

I love ultraboosts but this particular shoe has hard fabric on the sides The fabric digs into the middle part of my left foot

This is actually my third pair Bought them just in case Adidas stops making them Best Shoes Evah

Boost is definitely LIFE Use my ultraboost to run errands and for day to day activities They are easy to put on and are super comfy Pricey but worth every penny

They are super comfortable I would definitely recommend a pair

The cagefree is a great feel for my high arch feet

Adidas Ultraboost trainers are the best very comfortable for both running and walking around the city

I am usually in between size 11 5 to 12 but for the Ultraboost I have been getting them in size 12s Even with the half size up the shoe can be snug initially but quickly adjusts after about a half day of wear For the color I really enjoy this black with white sparkles colorway as it goes with pretty much anything it is a Ultraboost so it make you feel like you are waking on clouds and this one is no exception Overall a great shoe that has both the looks and the comfort

Most comfortable shoe on the market Ultra boost provides the most support available I have a bad back and for that reason among others I only buy Ultra boost

Feels like you are walking on clouds Great for travel and everyday use Cage provides great support Very durable and breathable

One of the most comfortable shoes I own I have since this purchase bought a few others

They have already ripped and this was an incredibly bad purchase I have used the shoes minimally since purchasing them for the intention of running just a little over thirty days ago Ridiculous pricing for this quality AVOID

Great shoe very comfortable and good looking Would buy again

Your feet will thank you at the end of the day Invest in Ultraboost invest in your health Will buy more Ultraboost

I like the product Very comfortable Light weight

Ultraboost are my fav shoe ever let me preface this review by saying that This review may be a bit bias but I did not come to love the Ultraboost by accident it is the most comfortable shoe on the planet in my opinion and many others Sure boost makes its great but the PrimeKnit upper works in tandem with the boost to create this cloud like ride for ur dogs At the end of the day when you take them off it is not like you feel so thankful for taking them off Like other sneakers you say ahhh when taking them off after a long day Ultraboost after a long day when you take them off it is no big deal that is because you do not feel restraint or restrictions in any way you can wear these for 24hrs straight standing up still not wanna take them immediately off when you get home Just the perfect shoe in my opinion you can not go wrong They fit true to size but you can go a 1 2 size up if need be

There some of the most comefertable shoes for the money I own multiple pairs and have enjoyed them

Great shoes but a little too snug and feel smaller than the 3 0s I had

Adidas nailed the color way comfort cushioning and just about everything else I love the shoes and I can not wait to get a hold of a pair of 19

The shoe is a shoe and feels shoey almost like a shoe

The most comfortable shoes in the market running has become wonderful in my life again after 30 years

Adidas updated the sole from the original UltraBoost sole to the Continental version that will last longer Its nice to see them are manufacture an old shoe design and I appreciate the drop

One of my many favorites love the color scheme the was incorporated into these Boost

This is simply the best running shoes I have ever purchased it is stylish and comfortable I would buy another pair once it wears out

These are great for all day wear I did not like the color as much in person I thought they seemed whiter than in the pictures

Not the most stylish shoe But it is very comfortable when you are working

Love that Adidas is finally utilizing 2 toned cages and different color heelcups Now if they would only do the same with boost we would be set Great pair of kicks and since they are Ultraboost they are more comfortable then any other shoe in existence

Love the black foam but the treads on the bottom wore down after 2 months of running on trails and asphalt

Love the design of the shoe will get more for my collection

Great fit great looking another stellar ride from adidas

Incredibly comfortable shoe Ultraboost cured my Plantar Fasciitis

This is the best shoe ever very comfortable and stylish I really like the color too

My Ultraboosts are the most comfortable pair of sneakers that I own and I own over 100 pair

This is by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn It is very unique looking too so if you want people to notice they will I painted the midsoles black and I like them more that way

The uncaged is tight across the instep for some of us

Go a half size up other than that the Ultraboost is one of the best shoes on the market

Great shoe on my 2nd pair Good all day comfort I have used them too hike as well impressed with how well they hold up in spite of being uncaged

i liked this because i enjoy boost and the fit is very good

Comfy and stylishI recommend everybody buy a pair of these shoes

they are one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever owned I do not love them for working out but for lounging around they are great

My most comfortable shoe I have a few pairs of nmds and I recommend these instead of nmds or alphabounces These are a lot more comfortable look better

Amazing shoes very comfortable and fits perfectly

I love this shoe so much I have used it that last few month to tour Europe and they have held up great on top of being super comfortable Only problem I had is they came with a snag in top part of the fabric but I had no time to exchange them before my trip

This a great shoe From top down it is the standard for any shoe going forward

Bought these shoes for the gym after reading that Ultraboost is the hot new thing They are stylish and comfortable but unfortunately a little narrow and has no support for HIIT workouts Foot kept slighting from side to side and overlapping into the soles Would of kept them for the stylish aspect but unfortunately had to return as I needed something with more support

One of the most comfortable shoes I own and the color are not bad either

These shoes are incredibly comfy and great for running they are a bit narrow for people with wide feet like me but they will stretch eventually

Wanted a pair of ultra boost as well as sock tops sneaks Very nice

Solid shoe Highly comfortable Would recommend to anyone

great shoe all around would definitely recommend to someone looking for a shoe to just wear around The shoe is listed as a running shoe but if you are actually trying to go out there and grind this is not your shoe

The colorway is beautiful and worth the wait ultraboosts are always great performers Just slightly dissapointed how the shoes came obviously used and slightly dirty Reccomend them either way

The uncaged version of the ultra boost is defiantly different But overall I seem to find it even more comfortable if that would be possible The prime kit hugs your foot like a sock and the boost heal and midsole are excellent Only wish there was maybe a little more ankle support

I have an old version of this shoes and I loved this shoes Unfortunately I wore them so often that I got some holes on them I had no choice but to buy a new pair of this shoes The new version looked different a bit but I ordered them Now I have felt serious pain on my toes since I tried the new one I bought the same size as the old one and also the fit is not really a problem It feels so uncomfortable that I can not wear it since I tried once I wish I could return it and my toes would feel better ASAP I am so disappointed I wish I could fix my old Ultra Boost

Fit is amazing shoe is light however while boost is comfortable not as cushy as NMD

I spotted a good deal on a pair of UltraBoosts and I had to scoop some up to find out what the hype was all aboutboostislife These shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned in the 40 years of wearing shoes The step in comfort of the boost along with the way the Primeknit lovingly wraps around your feet Heaven on earth in a pair of adidas

Great product fit amazing good for anything like running and soccer

the boost are incredibly comfortable and are great for short distance running I have only run 3 4 miles in them They are snug and grip the foot well The traction is great too

Very comfortable and well fitting shoes for gym or comfort

I am drawn to the style for sure and find them to be comfortable it is a great shoe to workout and walk in

If you are looking to use Boosts for the gym rather than as a fashion shoe these work really well The sock upper does a good job of streamlining the silhouette to work well with joggers and tights

My go to shoes for anything that has to do with running or lots of walking I wear them everyday at my uni I will be buying another pair soon

Great shoe Wine red color skews towards dark purple in certain light

Because they are light and comfortable and I can wear them with whatever I do

Amazing shoe Very light and comfortable and fits like a sock

No Color is not accurate in the picture of the white on the bottom

Comfort Style It is the OG UB after all The one that started it all

I wanted to buy Ultraboosts for a long time and when the thanksgiving promotions were on I finally went for one These shoes are insanely comfortable Yes they could have been a tad bit wider but the sole is amazing I have worn these on 16 hour flights and they did not make my feet uncomfortable at all I also use these for running and that is when you really appreciate the boost sole I would definitely buy them again

Very comfortable and good fit I would buy them again

for the comfort wise i like the regular ultraboost shoes than this one but still this is very comfy and stylish no one told me my shoe look good when i wear regular ultraboost but already few people told me this shoes looks awsome

Perfect running shoes for athletes Perfect weight and comfiness

Only question how would it effect the performance to insert a orthopedic insertWould it be bad to replace the current insert

This shoe is really comfortable and is even better in person The colors are really rich

Super comfortable looks great and works with almost anything

I am a size 9 and I ordered a size 9 5 and they seem to fit perfectly I highly recommend these shoes as they are easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Highest quality shoes I have worn so far Feet are very comfortable each day and I walk 5 miles every day I will buy the black foam bottom ones next time as these get dirty way too easy they just were not available when I bought them

Great shoe in every aspect Comfortable and stylish

I love this shoes They are comfortable unbelievably comfortable Lightweight and soft yet durable and strong And in all terrain Gonna get a second pair soon

I love my ultraboosts and will continue to purchase them BUT my recent grey 3 0 purchase ran way too small I am normally a 11 to 11 5 but i had to get a size 12 to feel comfortable and not tight so definitely go up a full size

Super comfortable Feels like a sock with great support The 1 0are my favorite style

I have had them since Christmas I am not sure when they came out but good shoe overall

Comfortable shoe Stylish Lightweight Fits perfectly I like this version better than the cage diversion Provide a cleaner look less bulky plastic

was thinking that they would be better for walking around all day but they started to get uncomfertable They also seem to heavy and bulky for running which kinda sucks because i was hoping for a multi purpose shoe Overall a good shoe though

These are really comfortable shoes Verry happy with my purchase

So comfortable and stylish these are all I wear they are worth every penny

I am an avid ultra Boost fan however when I received this shoe I was underwhelmed with this specific color way I ended up returning but still continue to buy more ultra boosts because they are fantastic

Great comfortability Good construction Nice sneaker

The black is super nice but the white balances it out for sure

Such a comfy shoe when I come home I do not even want to take it off

It squeezes a bit tight on my feet but is otherwise great This is disappointing though because the reason I buy Adidas is the shoes are usually wide enough for me

Boost is awesome and very comfortable This is the OG Ultraboost and I need it in my collection

These shoes look and feel incredible By far my new favorite shoes Just need to keep them clean now

They are very snug but too tight at times it is great for running or a long walk

Comfortable easy to fit into foot flexible nice design too

Look is great and they are extremely comfortable

Very comfy and light The weight of the fabric is sufficient

I have pretty wide feet so I ordered a half size up from my NMD size and absolutely love them They feel marginally better than caged Ultraboost 

This shoe fits like a glove I recommend going true to size you have gotta pick the right colorway though because some of these look trash on feet Been wearing them pretty frequently for the last 2 weeks with no issues

Love the ultra boost shoes however I returned these once I received them I was not too fond of this color way and they looked different in real life than they did in pictures Just was not what color I was looking for

I wear a women size 12 but they were out of stock I have wide feet so I got a men 10 5 and they fit perfectly they are really comfortable and the color pattern hides little marks and scuffs I love white but hate when they get dirty

The Ultraboosts just keep getting better and feeling more comfortable Using these for the gym they are providing a good amount of breathe ability and malleable to my feet

They are so comfortableand usually some shoes ride up as these do not

They are so comfortable and help my feet so much

Ultraboosts are the most comfortable shoes that I own and this colorway is straight fire

I like it in all sides really it is the best purchase I ever had

I have worn the black with white bottoms for about 1 year now I work in sales so im on my feet for 12 hrs a day sometimes I used to wear dress shoes but my feet began to throb and I just decided to wear these By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Slick style too

The original ultraboost was and is by far the most comfortable shoe I have worn but now that I bought the uncaged ultras the originals might have some good competition due to the sock like feel of the uncaged boosts which is what I like very much

Fits like a glove This replace my other running shoe which gave me problems when I ran After putting these new shoes thru a couple runs I can say my issues went away I went and bought another pair

It was really good comfort in the sole Problem was they were a little wide but other then that they were fire

It Is a very reliable shoe and I recommend It I have warn it for about 2 years and they are still in a good condition

Triple black is a easy purchase for me I wish they had left the lace tips black as well as the insoles instead of red These fit a bit tighter then the other 4 0 models I do have wide feet so narrow feet should be ok going true to size

Very comfortable gets dirty easily should have got black ones

The end of the right upper wrap is not well finished that constantly scratches the skin outside the achilles tendon

Comfortable and stylish and easy to put on Very light

This is the best shoe I ever bought It is really comfortable They are really durableI have had them for two years and they are still really comfortable

super comfortable shoes but definitely order a half size up

Great combo with the ultraboost sole and the upper on these comfortable

Was looking for a replacement for my Energy Boost shoes and this fit perfectly

I really liked these shoes for running and just for school because they were very comfortable and not too expensive

These shoes are very comfortable and they are great for distance running

These shoes are AWESOME It literally feels like I am walking on a cloud Highly recommend Get a half size down because they run a tad bit big

The comfort level is remarkable as well as the durability

Shoes are very comfortable and high quality Strongly recommend ordering at least a half size up

they are great shoes certain colors run very narrow

Definitely a comfortable shoe but did not use for running at all since forefoot slides way too much without any caging or support but even without any mileage and just casual wear the outsole is ripping off after just 7 months

The shoe is great and the quality allows for it to hold up after meny wears

The shoe is very comfortable and I would recommend

The BOOST technology is the most comfortable thing to place on your feet

The shoes were too small I got the same size as normal and it felt like I got a whole size smaller if not more If you are getting these expecting the sizes to be the same as the 3 0or even 2 0you should probably go up at least a half a size bigger its bad when you have to look and see if you got a womanshoe by accident

Ultraboost never fails at its comfort and style you can wear these for a long period of time also dress them up with anything These are my all time favorite shoes plus the NMDs that are very close to each other comfort and both being so stylish

I liked these shoes for the style and comfort You can wear them with almost anything Although they are great for most things they are not great for rainy days as the boost gets dirty easily other than that it is a quality Order half a size up though

One of the best shoes I have ever worn Extremely comfortable and at the same time a very clean and simple design 10 10 for these should would highly recommend these shoes

I have a lot of shoes that I normally rotate through but these have found their way in more than others They are so comfortable and I get compliments all the time

Comfortable and good overall shoe took them for a run and could say they were as good as the other ultra boost I own

Great everyday shoe if you are on your feet a lot Perfect for walking around the city

Ultra boost is always a winner Bought for a friend that is a first time booster he was happy

This product was a great fit for me and I like this product

I got these for my backpacking trip in Europe They have been incredibly comfortable for those long walks Best decision ever

Most comfortable shoe out there highly recommended for all foot types

The shoe is comfortable fits flawlessly and is weightless The uncaged ultraboosts are flawlessly designed shoes and if you are considering buying any running shoe it is almost mandatory you buy these shoes sent by God

By far the most comfortable shoe made by adidas or any other brand I have everyone in my family wearing something with boost cushioning and they cannot believe the difference It has even helped someone I know with arthritis pain as the primeknit upper is comfortable

Ultra Boost has become my go to shoe for running walking and casual wear They are extremely comfortable good fitting supportive and very stylish

Everything thing about this shoe is really good except the quality of plastic or rubber that the laces go around and through Mine tore at the top entrance of the lace so now I can not tie them snug

this product is proably the most comfy shoes i have tried on I Reccomend these shoes to anyone who wants comfort and is a runner like me

Loved the color combination and the looks of the shoes omg the contrast is so good to stand out in the crowd Of course ultraboost gives it a lot more points so I would really recommend this one

These shoes are great for anythingfrom running to working out in the gym to just walking around the city

would purchase again got them for a great price very comfortable

Extremely comfortable and nice design excellent for running boost works as advertised

Shoe fits like a glove Comfortable stylish made extremely well

The Ultraboosts got me through the hardest time of my life I underwent 4 back surgeries over 4 years for sciatica Walking was excruciating Then I found these Although I was still miserable these shoes made it better I could get through the day because I was not slamming my vertebrae into concrete with every step They are incredibly comfortable in the upper snugly but comfortably hugging your foot Boost cushioning was a game changer for me Every step your foot lands on a high end foot mattress Slip on slip off Perfect But more black boost please

it is an amazing shoe the comfort is unbelievable fits perfect and just well made

Like walking on air Perfect for being on your feet all day walking or short to mid distance runs can not believe how comfortable these are Love them

Very high quality and super comfortable I am buying my second pair after running the first pair into the ground They ware well too

Hello Adidas Their products are good quality and beautiful Everything I bought in black friday was only with you The ultraboost are incredible but I think they were used before because if they came new apparently but with some details Thank you

It fit nice and I liked it alot but it was expensive

Overall the shoe fits perfectly the upper conforms to your feet when you are walking and even better with running

very lightweight fits perfectly these are my go to running shoes

The most comfortable of all the ultraboost line available

I tried them on and my initial thought was they fit awfully snug especially around the ankle Some shoe trees will stretch out the ankles Must have in the collection

they are so comfy and durable I would recommend this shoes to everyone

THIS IS THE BEST SHOE EVER BECAUSE ITS SO COMFORTABLE IT FEELS LIKE HEAVEN FOR YOUR FEET WOULD 220 RECOMMEND FOR ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO ARE LOOKING TO TAKE LONG RUNS ON CITY STREETS THESE SHOES ARE AMAZING do not WAIT TO BUY THEM ESPECIALLY IF YOU TRAVEl

This color way is by far the best 4 0 ultraboost out there and to top it all off it is the most comfortable

Love these I felt the other triple black 4 0 releases had a snugger primeknit I am super happy these feel more relaxed I bought 3 pairs

Great product So different from the other ub Definitely buy this sneaker

I decided to try them after reading a few reviews Most comfortable shoe i ever worn

Most comfortable line of sneakers Especially uncaged

Fits like a glove ankles heels width all perfect

Fit comfort look are better than expected could not have hoped for more

Comfort and style what more can you ask forTotally recommend 10 10

Great purchase The shoe is very comfortable and aesthetically pleasing

Really good shoe It is very comfortable and is a must buy for the price

I purchased these shoes to do my basic workout routine in the gym I have been asked several times what kind of shoes are theyThese are like working out in your socks with extra cushion of air under your feet Great shoes

I have always wanted a pair of Ultraboost Triple Blacks I am so happy I was able to grab a pair during Boost Week and before the transition to Ultraboost 19

Very comfortable shoes Purchased my first pair a few weeks ago Easy to slip on great for running and casual wear My only complaint is that they get dirty pretty easily and I recommend you order a 1 2 size up

Super comfortable shoes that look good with everything

Great shoes nice comfy but make sone noise in some surface

Best shoe on the market for comfort The 1 0 seems to run smaller than the newer ultraboosts so go half size up on these

I have the original OG Ultra Boost The are release of the OG Ultra Boost just got even better Fits great looks as amazing as it ever did but the best part is having the Continental outsole This alone will make this shoe live longer than the previous model The previous one did not have the Continental outsole and wore out really quick For a running shoe that was not good let alone making slipper floors a time for caution Happy to have another pair in store One of the best Ultra Boosts of all time

Great comfort just consider going a half size down when getting any time of knit materials

The shoes have so much clout and they are ridiculously comfortable

do not like these shoes at all they came with something black on the sole and they are much too small

I like this product due to its quality and supportive

I mean come on ultraboost are meant to be comfy and without a doubt these 4 0 series are worth it do not debate on this purchase Just buy it It should be noted that if you have slightly wide feet it will be slightly narrow Just try it

From the fit to the finish the Ultraboost line has the best running shoes I have worn

The shoe has a very nic design that fits most outfits

Very comfortable and wonderful color Laces compliment the shoe

i would half size up in these had to return them due to the tighter fit

I have had a numerous pairs of adidas shoes that featured boost and prime knit Though the boost technology is amazing the quality of the prime knit is not I have had a pair of NMDs show small rips within months of wear These specific boosts ripped similarly in the prime knit of the front of the shoe The color way and comfort was amazing and it was one of my favorite shoes in my collection but its disappointing that the prime knit just is not that durable Guess I might just have to try sewing the rip or something

Great comfort and formfitting to your foot I would suggest a half size down

Amazing shoes they fit perfect are comfortable and look great with every thing

Love the Ultra boost line But the newer colors the darker grey feel a little tight Sometimes while driving my feet will fall asleep probably from the constriction I have a pair of the all white and have no complaints at all But I have had these grey ones for almost a month now and worn them a good amount and still have not felt any difference

Simply Amazing

Great shoe looks great super comfy and fit good

extremely soft cushion and very suitable primeknit Good duration Just a little bit easy to get dirty

Great shoes slightly tight at first but gets better by loosening laces and braking them in

The design is simple yet still looks amazing and very stylish

Really surprised to see how few are mentioning this shoes does not run small Half size up for truest comfort All pairs I have owned were like this

When I first put them on I thought they felt a little tight I wore them for a few hours and that totally went away and they feel perfect now For people with really wide bulbous feet they might have a problem with them because regardless of how you lace or unlace them they are limited to how much the elastic collar will give

Comfortable shoe The white color gets so dirty tho Like it is impossible to keep them clean looking for more than 2 normal days of wearing them

I own over 5 different pairs of Ultraboosts and they are soooo comfortable I can stand and walk around for hours without a single complaint will not recommend for working out since I do not consider it as a running shoes but anything else will do

good price

Very comfortable Good running Not as good for sharp cuts training given ankle stability

Comfortable with a quality build If you want a light shoe then this is your choice

I now have six pairs of these shoes I am in love

Sizing very inconsistent I have other ultraboosts and they fit true to size I ordered the OGs and they fit way too tight even without the insole

Great looking shoe and so comfortable Sadly I ordered 11 5s first and they were too tight but length was great Ordered the 12 and suddenly too long but the width was good I am sure I am being picky but for a running shoe I do not like having a full 75 inches between my toe and the front of the shoe

Had a pair over a year old that was great yet have bought or exchanged it three times over last 4 months as plastic where laces are has not been structured correctly and constantly rips making sneaker unusable

I love my pair of Ultra boosts they are very stylish and great for comfort Adidas Tiro pants go very well with these I own two pairs of NMDS as well as these and very soon plan to buy a second pair of these Great for the money

This were some pretty nice pair of shoes because they are good quality

The boost is super comfortable and your feet wont get sore

The product is nice but not wearable in the casual setting I say this because the heel protrudes llike half an inch from the back it looks funny I returned mine for this reason but if I was the type fo person who wears a lot of basketbal shorts joggers etc then these would be perfect

Well worth the cost was not sure at first but glad I took a chance and bought them

Love the comfort and great color combinations Well done

Super light feather like but super comfortable like what a much heavier shoe with tons of cushion padding probably feels like

This shoe is very beautiful and comfortable I can wear it everywhere The price is lower than the quality I am very satisfied with this product

Why these are the best shoes everTheir versatility I got my first pair about a year ago I got another pair a week later I shattered my leg a couple of years ago and since then I have always had trouble running on hard surfaces due to discomfort in my leg I got a pair of these and the pain diminished They are great for running and extremely comfortable I got a second pair as slip ons because they look amazing and you can easily loosen the laces and slip them on The price is a bit steep but I have not ran into any problems with the quality I highly reccomend these shoes for anybody and alost any scenario My only advice is to try them on at a store first because they run a little bit big in my opinion

Looks cool nice fit I will wear it often and not worry about it getting dirty

Extremely comfortable running shoes that I can even wear on the plane Easy to take on off but supportive enough to exercise in

Like the quality and knit flex but pressure with thin front cushion is not enough to not have toe pain in a front foot runner and Continental outsole traction wears down super quick on just a test on the bedroom floors that are laminated wood so too soft and wears down on the inside edge This is very disappointing and not car tire rubber or it would not wear down instantaneous like this Most comfortable and really meant to be used without socks for max comfort Good for 10 1 4 to 10 1 2 sized feet but not sure if the knit will not tear in use or in a wash

I love my 350and EQT Boosts I even have quite a few Alphabounces and NMDbut none of them feel like the Ultraboosts do on my feet The run a bit small so I always get a 1 2 size up I would go in to a store for a fitting before committing to ordering on line Cheers

Great look super comfortable like the rest of my ultra boost

First I love the boost I just ordered a second pair but I will complain that the shoe does not last as long as I would hope they would The continental wore down pretty quickly and now they squeak pretty bad so annoying I will give this next pair another try and go from there

I love this pair of shoes Very comfortable for running

I love the product Would like a better lining for the shoe

i like the shoe but its stayed nearly the same for 4 generations change it up

Very comfortable when I am running I can run longer with this shoe

The boost is extremely comfortable and these shoes were my first experience with boost I wear socks with the uncaged and I really enjoy the feel that the cuff gives It makes the shoe feel a lot more form fitting Definitely would recommend

This show is very comfortable Would highly recommend to get yourself a pair

My go to show

Experienced runner or neutral runner you can run all day in these shoes

It is very comfortable and light weight I had Two pair of ultra boost and I am wearing adidas shoes from the last 20 years so great company with good shoes models

I got my pair of shoes and they fit very well and are comfortable but the sole had already started to rip after 1 week and by the second week the sole was peeling a lot near the heal cup

Comfort is excellent Great fitment i say go true to size or half a size up

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn These have become my everyday shoe The boost outsold is so comfortable and the primeknit upper adds to the comfort I recently bought my first pair a month ago and now own multiple pairs

Really comfy and great looking Matches almost all outfits

I like most Adidas shoes especially the Ultraboost

Super comfortable and love the color scheme Very nice

The stretchy primeknit upper combines with the responsive boost midsole to create the ultimate in comfort The grippy Continental rubber outsole is just the cherry on top Tip if you wipe off the Boost midsole on a regular basis it will not turn yellow

Bottom foam ripped in less than 3 months The cushion is comfortable for about 1 month then it loses its bouncing capability and starts to become very uncomfortable and hurts the foot

Excellent overall shoe I got this shoe as a gift and I absolutely love them

it is really ugly and stinky it fells like im standing on a stone WARNING DO NOT BUY

Great light shoe for casual running Felt like I was running on a cloud

This shoe is so comfortable that you can wear it to sleep Highly recommend

Comfortable as expected and sleek with the Orca style color

Whoever engineered this design hats off

Very comfortable and look great feels like your walking on clouds

it is very comfortable and best shoes for running on the road

I would recommend this product because the boost makes the shoe very comfortable and so does the stretchy prime knit With this combination it makes it a amazing slip on shoe

I do like the product but the shoelaces are missing It would be perfect if i do get the shoelaces back

I got these because I have wide feet and I could feel the cage on the regular Ultraboosts pressing against the wide part of my foot do not want to end up with bunions The Ultraboost Uncaged are extremely comfortable and look great for both running and casual use If I have one complaint it is that there could be a little more structure in the toebox for stability while running since I can feel a little give in my forefoot when I push off Also the sock around your ankle will eventually loosen which may be more comfortable but seems to defeat the purpose of having such a opening in the first place

Shoes are really comfortable and lasts me during long run and walking sessions

First time i wore Ultra Boosts the walk from my front door to my car was the most comfortable walk i ever had Never looked back and i will continue to buy them when i need new shoes

I have two pairs of ultra boosts one for street cricket very old pair and a newer pair which I use for everything The shoes are stylish and comfortable but not too over the top They are superbly comfortable to run in and can survive for 100of kilometres

Yes Perfect size and came on time And looks just like the photos

Very comfy Would recommend to everyone if I could I use it everyday

I like the feeling of this shoes to wear i like it

The shoe slips on easily and can be worn all day with extreme comfort

These shoes are good the white color gets dirty easily but can easily be cleaned and will look brand new again

Pretty good shoes but the color was more sparkly in hand then in the pictures

love this shoe and all ultra boosts by far the most comfortable shoes

Comfort outstanding great fit superb quality overall

Its like walking on water very comfortable feel on my feet

These shoes are so comfy it is like walking around on pillows And they are quiet No squeaking like the vapormax Only drawbacks are hard to keep clean and may lack arch support for extended time on your feet

adidas has been weird but kind when it comes to sizing I bought parley ultra boost in a size 9 5 and it fits well but it is a tight fit today I went to the adidas store and saw these beauties and i wanted to get them however they only had size 9 and 11 so i thought i would disappoint myself and try the size 11 but to my surprise it actually fits quite well maybe even more than the 9 5 so yeah either way i love these shoes

I have worn these shoes almost everyday for a year straight they have been used in rain and snowfor running and walking they are still in excellent shape The only signs of wear are at the bottom of the shoe If you refer to the adidas product images above you all see the circles on the bottom Over a years time of use the upper middle circle portion has worn and they are just about flat Again I have used these shoes ALOT so this is to be expected I highly recommend these shoes Hope this helps

There is not a single shoe that can match their comfort

The only problem is when you go to play basketball your feet tend to slip off

I recently purchased the black with the white stripes and boost They were my first pair of 4 0s I have three pairs of 3 0 and I can honestly say that I do not have enough of these shoes I have other boost shoes but ultra boosts blow them out of the water in every aspect Perfect shoe

Surprisingly good for running Got addicted to these shoes and purchased another pair for change Best shoes for running

Best ultraboosts with a clean triple white colorway

I was not really Adidas shoe fan but my brother introduce me to these shoes and I have got to say I am runner and these are by far the most comfortable running shoes I have ever purchased

This is the second pair Ultra Boost Uncaged Shoes I have purchased

Large around the center with a super soft bottom but careful they scuff easy

Third pair since September Absolutely love them as I make the switch to these coming from air type

I own many ultraboost nmds and yeezys These are my favorite type of shoe that complete comfortably and style with it

Very comfortable true to size not too wide or too narrow

Got this gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it it is super comfy and stylish Would recommend for others to get

The ultraboost are awesome and are very comfortable HOWEVER the pair that was sent to me had minor flaws all over it There was a scuff part on the plastic portion of the shoe connecting the uppers to the midsole which was very disappointing There are also loose strings everywhere and too much glue on the left toe box Overall I am not too happy with the quality of the pair that was sent me

These shoes are perfect have gotten tons of complements on them Very comfortable

Just like any other UltraBoost shoe stylish with great comfort

The shoe is so light and comfortable that it feels like I am walking on clouds ALL THE TIME

I love the shoe a lot and I am even thinking of grabbing another pair just a different color it is that good

This shoe is great either for running or just daily needs like walking It fits like a sock and is the most comfortable shoe I have ever wore I recommend getting this shoe The style and the comfort of these shoes are just insane

The boost is so comfy soft and the material wraps the foot like a sock and breathes

I prefer the ultraboost uncage over the regular ultraboost

Very comfortable and stylish I like the color and fit

Love it really comfortable this is my 5th and will not be my last

Love the way it fits around the ankle and the cushion around that same area The boost feels better than normal ultra boost I have worn

My only concern is that around the front of my ankle is a little too tight for my liking for all day sitting down If you are going to me on the move all day or running LOL these and other ultraboosts are the way to go

Very Comfortable A little tight at first but overall a great shoe

I am a barber on my feet for hours so comfort is a must And these deliver just that

Love them Super comfortable will buy another pair

 seeing the product in person they are extremely comfortable constructed well and have a contemporary fresh look

Great buy Extremely light comfortable and good quality

Great shoe overall Only issue is that the foot sole keeps coming out whenever I take the shoe off I believe several other people have mentioned this

At first it felt a little tight but now it fits just right

This shoe performs exactly as it should I personally love it as most of my work out is cardio machines and core flexibility The ultraboost bottom is comfortable and takes stress off knees and back The upper is very lightweight and unstructured While not for everyone Eg aggressive cross training they are perfect for my workouts and activities I wore them on a trip to Europe and easily walked 15 to 20 miles everyday with little stress or pain

The fabric top is comfortable and feels great but the shoe is a little tough to get on because there is not a firm grip on the rear like the regular ultra boosts

Awesome Ultra Boost can not go wrong with this Ultra Boost comfort and looks great

Too narrow of a shoe Even without a sock the shoes felt tight

Great shoes very comfortable for the feet Would recommend to all

My first pair of UB were UB Parley that I bought a size 11 5 When I wear those they are very comfortable but just a bit too much room at the tip of my toe so for this pair I figured size 11 would be the sweet spot Not sure if these are made differently but this pair was a bit too tight even more than the break in period Maybe I will have to go back to size 11 5 not sure

The comfort real good 4 walking and standing 4 continuous hrs

Light weithgh do not need tie over and over again

Love the uncaged ultra boost Great colorway and great price for a quality shoe

They always catch a persons attention It fits perfectly like a sock

Love the shoe and fits well but it was dirty when I got it 

Great product i wish i can afford more i truly love it

Like any Ultra Boost product this might be the most comfortable shoe you ever put on your feet the cushioning is amazing does not due Justice to the comfort level if heaven gave out shoes they would give out Ultra Boost This colorway was not a particular favorite of mine until i got them in hand the pictures do not do them justice very cool looking shoe

It needs better forefoot lockdown It would also be nice to get some non trail mid top ultra boosts The knit upper could be more durable too Overall nice shoes

Show is to narrow and I can not wear I will just stick to pureBoost but would love me some Ultras

This is my very first Ultra Boost Shoe the fit and finish of the shoe is really nice I very comfortable to wearing and working out in them

Perfect fit comfort everything so enjoyable Waawaaweewaa

Breathable upper that has a snug fit The boost is very comfortable and provides a stable ride It feels fast like a racing shoe Great value when on sale

To be honest I was initially skeptical about UltraBoosts I had heard so much praise that I was sure they would not live up to the hype As soon as I slipped on a pair I instantly understood it is hands down the most comfortable footwear technology I have experienced The Primeknit is a soft flexible material so they do fit snug but that is normal as it shapes to the contour of your feet so it gets a bit to get used to itnonetheless I recommend going true to size If you get the regular caged version I would go up half a size as they seem to run small I was also impressed with the qualityno visible glue leaks nor irregularities I look forward to buying more pairs

Bought these because I was going to be doing a lot of walking on vacation These shoes absorb nearly all the shock as you walk and keep your foot nicely cushioned I especially like the breathable uppers my feet no longer sweat Easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Ultra boost still one of the most comfortable sneakers out there I went 1 2 size up on this pair and the fit was much better for my feet True to size for me feels too snug Color is awesome

Very comfortable and great everyday sneaker I would reccomend these sneakers to everyone

Ran a 5k in these felt like I was running on clouds The boost actually gave me an extra relief of comfort as I was running

The design quality and comfort are superior And the color selection is a bonus

Very comfortable The only issue is that the inner sole slides around and bunches up sometime

I love the comfort level they are a perfect fit walking all day makes them the perfect shoe

Very nice shoe a little tight but I can see that is for a little added comfort and less foot slippage Break in first

I love this shoes they are very confy made for running walking or hanging out Color is attractive

Great color and comfort feel very durable and clean

it is very good for running my boy love it very much

I have several pairs of sneakers but these are1

it is a comfortable shoe and it looks good too it is a all around great shoe

I have several ultra boost sneakers and just got a pair of classic black color it is awesome

Literally clouds on feet and bought 1 2 size bigger 11 and it fit me like my regular size 10 5

Everything is good except for it is a bit too narrow for me

I love this shoe This is my third pair of ultraboost and will definitely not be my last The color ways are always great Its an all around shoe for all occasions They are worth the money I highly recommend these to everyone

Great shoes for running and casual I buy a half size up and that creates the perfect fit

I will keep or return them If I up a size the shoe may be too wide I much preferred the way the previous version fit

Very comfortable with great price

This shoes was for my son he loves the comfort great quality really recommend it

I am addicted to Ultraboosts No shoe compares I will buy these until they no longer make them

Super light it is like wearing slippers Like the color combo too

Fits like a sock Shipped in about 2 days great experience

Comfy do not like the placement of the stripes though

Im a huge fan of Ultraboost I have run my last 3 marathons on Ultraboost Love them So comfy and stylish The color is just perfect

This is most comfortable series of shoe you could get your feet into

Very comfortable shoe great feel and look 

One of the most comfortable if not the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn You really notice how soft they are when walking up and down hilly or sloped areas

it is very comfortable I would recommend it to a friend

Very comfortable and has great style and look to them as most people have cages

Product is exactly as I thought it would be a very comfortable shoe

I stress the fact that shoes have to fit well and be comfortable Joey says these shoes fit well look great and are so comfortable He is shoe picky so I would say this one was a hit

Bought these for my husband He immediately liked the feel and bounce He always has a size 8 5 but these were a bit too small Exchanged them for a 9 now they are perfect

Uncaged version makes better for casual shoes for all day comfort The prime knit is super stretchy

these shoes are ultimate comfy and the black white colorway is quite stylish very happy with these shoes

These are the most comfortable shoes ever designed for long distance running and with so many choices in colors you can have one pair for each day

I bought 3 pairs of the identical shoe That way 5 years from now I will still be rocking these

A more colorful midsole would be a plus but overall an excellent pair of sneakers

To find my son a pair of shoes he likes is almost impossible he would go barefoot year round if he could He LOVES these and raves constantly on how comfortable and lightweight they are It is no longer a bad day when he says he needs shoes we can just order from home and he KNOWS he will like them THANK YOU

As always top quality with the Ultraboost line a bit more narrow then my other boost

A wee bit smaller than I would like but otherwise perfect shoes Super comfy

This shoe is so cute and I love it it is a little narrow for my likinghowever it stretches enough and the boost support system is comfortable enough to counterbalance the narrowness

Most comfortable sneakers ever have not worn another pair of sneakers since the release of UltraBoost

My son loved the comfort and style but he has only had them a week and already starting to get ragged near the toes

Great shoes The comfort on these is unbelievable Love the design and how it looks on you

This is my second pair of UltraBoost shoes I put several hundred miles on the first pair and still use them They were not really worn out yet but I wanted to have a backup pair in case this model was discontinued or changed significantly I love the flexibility of the upper and the durability of the soles

despite uncomfortable with insole these shoes are good quality and light weight

These shoes are very comfortable and very grippy and stick to the ground for running

Great shoes has a lot of spring to them and I would recommend them to anyone for daily use or running These are my day to day shoes even at work But if you compare them to my Goku ZX500 I would say they are not as comfy

I like it is very comfortable and you do not need to tie the laces

Solid shoe Looks dope and is functional too The white is also super clean and the reflective looks good

This ultra boost is the more comfortable and light ever

Letters wore away in two days stitching came out within a week Another China made trash product

Love the sneakers Most comfortable shoes ever I just wish they did not make the sole in white on every model as it gets so dirty so easily

Best running shoes ever I will definitely buy another pair of altra boost

Super comfortable but left shoe band is scratching the heck out of my Achilles it is where the sewing for the strap meets at heel and is super rough No issue with right shoe

classy comfortable and good looking

Couple weeks in this shoeby far the most comfortable running shoes Holds my feet firm while still allowing room to move on impact The outsole is not too bouncy nor too firmkeeps my feet stable and absorbs the pressure Hopefully will last long

A gift for my college son who walks so much on campus He loves them1

I love these shoes Wear them practically everywhere So comfortable They are a bit expensive though I watch for sales

I like them because it is like walking on clouds These and the Yeezys are by far the most cozy shoes I have ever owned

Love everything about this shoe except the insole tends to slide out whenever pulling your foot out Otherwise one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

I loved the color so much I ordered the men shoe I wear a women size 9 so I bought men size 8 Fit perfect

Ultraboost is one of my favorite running shoes its so comfy and very light

Great fit on this shoe Snug but not tight a true size 10 for me Ultraboost bottom provides great response and support

Shoe is phenomenal when it comes to quality and comfort I have flat feet and I am in my feet most of the time at work So glad I bought these shoes Wish they would of applied my 25 promo code which never got

The prime knit upper feels like I am wearing slippers and the UltraBoost sole is the most responsive sole I have worn

The width is a little narrow However still super comfortable Looks awesome Fits for casual and running

I have ran 9 half marathons in my life I am about to run my first full marathon in November I have been wearing Adidas boost for three years now I feel that there are the best running shoes for me and I have tried a bunch of different names Brand shoes over the years so far no other shoe has compared to them thanks

Extremely comfortable I walk several miles in New York daily so these shoes are game changer for me

They are really comfortable and fit perfectly Also these shoes are a sock shoe

I was looking for a new pair of running shoes so I started trying everything on Once I got to these I noticed an immediate difference as far as comfort and feel around the foot Although I did not make this choice as my running shoe and bought anyway for an everyday comfort

very comfortable shoe to wear when exercising Time will tell how they hold up over the next 6 months of exercising 5 times per week

I love these shoes They are my 5th pair I purchased these for my marathon run in New York on November 4th 2018

Really great but the back of the shoe rubs against the back of ankle Other than that super comfotable shoe

Ultraboosts are my favorite shoe Bought them for a friend

These shoes make me feel like I am walking on a cloud

great comfort and performance when running needed no break in period

Most comfortable shoe I own It is easy to put on and looks great with most outfits

excellent shoes beautiful can not find better elsewhere

Absolutely the best shoes I have ever owned Perfect fit perfect comfort perfect performance And I loooooove the electric blue color with the hints of the contrasting greens

Very comfortable running and everyday shoes You will enjoy it Looks much better in person then on the image

Super comfy and fit very well The ordered processed fast and came in mint condition

This is a very nice shoehowever I was expecting a more cushioned feel to the shoe with the Boost I do like the shoe but I have not put a lot of miles on it yet

It definitely is a very comfortable shoe and would buy again

bought these in a size 15 for my husband and they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned

Good purchase I have been looking for a running shoe for some time Very comfortable shoe my only complaint is the toe box is very soft makes your foot move around a lot

These Ultraboost uncaged are my favorite pair I bought a couple pairs of those the brand with the three stripes katakana laces for them they look fire Super comfortable no regrets

I would highly recommend buying this shoe Super stylish

Fits well but I was facing some issues in QC In the part where the Adidas logo is laminated there is some dirt I can not return i really like the shoes and they were cheap Full price I would return it

These shoes are very comfortable and have a wide bottom outsole so you will not turn your ankle as much as you might think Feels good because of the sock upper

Price not worth it it is so over price I like the ndm better

it is hard to go back to any other shoe after wearing these Ultraboost are the most comfortable shoes out there I can wear them all day and my feet thank me for it This is really a great product

Great fit but UltraBoost 4 0 and UltraBoost 4 0 Parley in the same size do not fit the same way

These shoe are are very comfortable You can not go wrong with these or nmd

Extremely comfortable breathes and fits well and looks stylish Best Shoe Ever

the softness of the inside feels perfect Almost everything was great except the gluing was a bit messed up

Very comfortable and perfect fit with great quality

I really like the all white look With the hint of grey color it gives a different look other than a pure all white shoe I love this shoe

Comfortable shoe Stylish A bit pricey but you get what you pay for in terms of what a shoe should be

Very comfortable Day to day now Already bought another pair

Got my first pair of ultraboosts a week ago I got the uncaged version Fits true to size I am a 11 5 in most brands These have to be hands down the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I love shoes with knit uppers since my feet get hot easily The Primeknit on these shoes is super flexible and breathable My feet stay cool And how about ultraboost I was a skeptic until I stepped into this pair BELIEVE THE HYPE The response on impact during a run or simply walking is amazing Not squishy that it hurts stability but just perfectly balanced Great job Adidas I am a believer Excited to try other shoes with technologies like boost and primeknit

Fits well even though wrong size they stretch adjusts very nice and very comfortable

I was nervous at first to buy this pair because I am use to the regular ultra boost I am happy though all around The shoe looks and feels great on

Everything about ultra boosts is great they have been great so far my only and very minor complaint is that the plastic tip on one of my laces was bent and warped

I was considering these or the pureboost but I was glad I chose these they are light and breathable enough for all day wear I find myself wearing these for cardio working out and all day at work Thanks

Yes yes it is the most comfortable shoes ever but the thing is it is a magnet for dirt

Very comfortable this is my first pair of the uncaged version and now my go to shoes for everything

It seems like you are walking in clouds Best shoes I have ever gotten

These shoes are the first like this I have ever bought and they feel like I am running on clouds Very strong clouds Do it Buy them

Comfortable shoe for everyday wear But shoe is a little small

Feels good I like the boost feeling Comfortable Thanks

These are quality built shoes and probably one of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn great cushion love the style highly recommend

more comfortable than expected I was worried that the colorway might get dirty quick but does not attract much dirt

Love the shoes the fit great and feel amazing

Love these shoes Just got them in So far great shoes

The look of the 3 stripe on the sides looks like carbon fiber The material is breatheable and good quality For the price is not bad if you could get it on sale Light and easy to slip on and off

These shoes have the most comfortable fit of any sneakers I have ever owned but the soles wear out faster than any shoes I have ever owned If they were to put on a more durable sole I would give them 5 stars Hopefully someone will listen

it is super comfortable the size is a perfect fit

Extremely comfortable sneaker Simple yet stylish

it is an ultra boost Most people already know about the comfort

Just a great shoe For everyday use and styleish if you want to kick it

Comfortable boost is immediately noticeable The knit materials fits the feet snugly Excellent shoes

The elastic band of the shoe rubs on the A Tendon If you wear higher socks then you should be fine The boos feels amazing and I got plenty of compliments on them Remember wear at least ankle socks

Heel to toe comfort I am on my feet all day and these shoes provide comfort throughout the entire day

it is a very comfortable and durable running shoe with curves helping a person to increase the pace

I had this shoes for a long time and they are so comfortable that I ordered another pair just to get the new ones with the white boost The only down side is that the white part gets dirty pretty fast

Just bought my 2nd pair and would not hesitate to get another when needed

Best shoe purchase I have made I would purchase another pair

The best pair of running shoes ever it is my third pair in the last two years

Love the new 4 0 boost the new tan color really shoes the ultraboost shape making it unique

A little snug on the bridge of my foot but overall great fit and great support

Love the uncaged Shoes fits snug at first in the toes and takes a few times of wearing before loosening up Now fits perfect Very comfortable Good support Neutral heel arch Only complaint is shoe feels a little warm which is odd because it is primeknit

I have three pair of regular Ultra Boost and was shy about getting the uncaged type for fear of losing foot support Not what I expected They are great Enough support and even more comfortable than the regular ultra boost I will definitely get more of these The look great too

Was blown away by the quality of the rubber did not realize before purchasing that it was made by Continental Fits perfectly

Maybe a smidge narrow for my wide feet I went 0 5 size up and it is great but MAN the cushioning is superb It was good right of out the box but after wearing it a few times it moulded to my feet and it is great Super comfortable shoe I use it at work not to run

I had never tried on this shoe before so I was a little nervous about buying them online I ordered my usual size and they fit perfectly This might be the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

I bought there is with no intention of using them as running shoes Simply looking for the most comfortable sneaker I could find that also looks good Found them it is basically like wearing socks with soles Simple as that

Super comfy shoe that lasts quite a while I have put hundreds of miles on my last pair walking to school and work Finally a new pair will keep me good for months

These shoes were probably the best investment in sneakers I have ever made I wear these to the gym and it is like walking on clouds Highly recommend

Very stylish and confortable I am berybhave with this purchase

Can become workout and casual shoes Looks great and feels great

Nice shoes with high quality and lower price I will contiune track in the new adidas producs

Very comfortable and lightweight Great choice of shoe for the gym

They look good feel good and they are great to run in They do get dirty very easily but aaide from that I love these shoes

it is very comfortable and the material is very breathable

These fit a bit tighter than other ultraboost but still look and feel awesome

Excellent running shoes Great comfort perfect fit

Hands down the most comfortable shoes that I own I have NMDVapormax React Alphabounce and they all do not compare Get these if you have the opportunity

One of the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn The fit was perfect at my size 12 and slides on with no problem Was light and comfy enough to wear around all day without much issue Overall one of my favorites

Perfect in all matters use them for everyday duties

These were a perfect fit and extremely comfortable I love the color

These are the epitomy of comfort and style and performance Love them

Honestly it is like walking on clouds Has a bouncy spring feel to it that will put a smile on your feet

I have bad feet and am on a constant quest to find comfortable shoes I have settled on Ultraboost shoes but these in particular are my favorite They slip on easily and feel like socks with clouds on the bottom Perfect

Very comfortable and perfect for walking and running

Look size feel everything about this pair is simply perfect

They say you pay for what you get it could not be more true for these Ultraboost I will admit I was reluctant at first to put that kind of money in a pair of running shoes and now I have two of them These shoes are at a whole new level of comfort and they look terrific too

I like the product because it is indeed comfortable and a great looking shoe

I love the shoe I just have a wide foot and it is made more for a narrow foot

I did not have to break in these shoes I put them on and they were immediately comfortable They are also very comfortable to walk in

These are genius So comfortable sleek lightweight simple and amazing in every way

Too expensive

I am not a runner but I just wanted comfortable shoes for walking and these shoes did the trick They feel different than anything else on the market and it definitely feels like your being propelled forward when you walk

This was the perfect addition to my sneaker rotation The hints of grey definitely give the shoe a better look than the traditional all white shoe As always the boost is super comfortable and the upper hugs your foot without constricting it

Comfortable stylish it is the best pair of shoes I have ever had

The overall look is great and comfortable to wear

Tried 2 pairs but had same problem sad because liked everything else about these shoes

Too fly Love these shoes Perfect fit and can go with anything

I had to return these even tho I absolutely loved them bc the boost insole kept flapping up everytime I tried sneaker on and came out and it was super annoying

Look great but foot beds come out when taking shoe off and size is smaller than usual for ultraboosts

pretty good shoes for runners pretty good shoes for runners

Shoe is very stylish really comfortable and it makes you feel good when walking

I was lucky enough to meet a field marketer for Adidas and she was able to size me correctly for mens and womens MENS had the color I wanted I am pleased with my purchase and I have NEVER spent that much on shoes before

The shoe was very comfortable as expected It did run a little bit tight but so I would up half a size

Love it coz it got a good cushion on my foot Used it with treadmill and the shoe has a perfect fit

Tried regular ultraboost did not like This is so much better in both comfort and style

This model gives me the comfort toe box room weight and conformity I love with a cushy ride to boot

Already copped a black pair in Feb it is the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn so I just copped an all white one Way more comfy than the NMDs but I like the NMD look better tbh

Great fit elastic top does not last Arch support is great

I run 20 miles week in these so far they are one of the most comfortable shoes I have run in My last 2 pairs of shoes have been from the company in Portland and the foam they use is kind of stiff especially compared to these I like that they are soft but supportive whatever tech they put into the soles is worth it because my legs never get tired in these and my soreness levels post run have dropped off massively My only complaint is that the soles seem to be wearing quickly

I am in love with these shoes I just feel like I have socks on and that I am walking on a cloud They are worth every penny

this shoes is very tight from top and very uncomfortable if you walk or run for a long time

Need extra support for standing all day so took the dive and purchased these They are very comfortable and give support for staying on your feet Fit wise I went half a size larger than normal especially if you have wider feet

it does not require the fitness period and fits my feet well

Super comfortable and came in the right size the first time

So good looking you just have to protect that pristine white finish

Very comfortable shoe high quality design with lots of small touches for comfort and practicality Also a very stylish shoe modern yet more timeless than most trending sneakers nowadays

SUPER comfortable with great foot support I no longer have back pains and I love how easy they are to put on and off thanks to the stretchable opening I wish I had found these earlier

This shoe uncaged or caged is a must for every hypeBeast shoe collection This is great looking fashionable sleek sexy looking shoe No only it looks good it feels good as well It can be used as gym shoes too they are really cool and aerodynamic There are only two drawbacks one that this can not be worn in wet weather and two the back sock sole of the shoe rubs on the ankles A lot of the times I have bleed with the shoe cutting the back part of the shoe cutting my ankles I am not sure if this is a production flaw to not and willing to provide pictures if necessary Overall I really like this shoe and it looks extra great when paired with ADIDAS Trackpants Again extremely fashionable just wearing this shoe will put on a whole another shoe game the top of the hierarchy next to all the ADIDAS YEEZY wearers I really recommend this shoe to anyone looking to look nice

I would love to trade mine in for a different ultraboost design because of the above reasons

The uncaged Ultra Boost offers a fit goes perfectly with the foot Also the sock upper really makes it very easy to slip them on and gives them a very nice look Overall really great shoe

i like the Primeknitelasticity in the proper places and the stiffness in others it feels like a sock Few shoes can make you forget you are wearing them these can

I absolutely love these shoes They are super comfy and look good but my only problem is that I can not clean my white pair very easily any tips

they are really good quality and feels like I am walking on clouds

I like the ability to wear it with anything and make it look good

The size is correct which is good for a pair of uncaged shoes Overall these shoes are good for all kinds of activities Well balanced

I went an entire day running errands with this shoe and did not feel any type of discomfort at all They are a bit pricy but you will not regret buying them once you wear them Be expecting lots of compliments also

comfortable like it think it might be not good in the rain

it is very comfortable and it looks amazing It feels like I am on clouds

The shoes are super comfortable I am on my feet a lot at work so these shoes really help

Just perfect My feet almost never sweat anymore within reason obviously

Super comfortable and they look great I have never owned a more comfortable pair of sneakers

My son loves it Very well made and is very stylish



This is my 4th pair the thing I need is more colors

Looks and comfort best of both worlds well worth the price tag

These shoes are insanely comfortable Have had them for a while now and they are still in perfect condition I bought the all white pair so if you do purchase this color way I would recommend being very careful about where you wear them Other than that these shoes are awesome

These sneakers are crazy comfortable and love the look of them

This is the perfect gym shoe Fits like a sock great impact absorption light and breathable Ready to buy another pair in a different color

Great fit love the boost technology that helps push me forward

fits and wears well loved the shoe would order again

It has great support for short and long distance runs It is stylish and it has very breathable technology

Very comfortable light and bouncy Highly rec this

Very comfortable shoes for every day usage and great colorways

The Uncaged Ultraboosts is comfy and stretchy though the ankle collar lost a lot of stretchyness very quickly and no longer wraps around my ankle The boost midsole is still incredibly comfortable

very breathable primeknit and incredible comfort awesome for working out

Absolutely love the Ultraboost Uncaged I wear them for lifestyle use rather than running and I find them incredibly comfortable for all day wear Impact protection and bounce from the Boost is incredible and the upper provides a great combination of lockdown and breathability In my opinion this shoe is better than the standard Ultraboost by far

Comfort and supports my running fsjklfsajfkls aksadlf

Provides support when running and is comfortable to wear

Perfect all around love the colors and fit I wish I had 2 pairs

Very comfortable perfect fit One of the best pair of shoes I have owned

The soles are springy and soft but provides plenty of support Makes me feel like I am bouncing when I walk The lack of a tongue in the shoe it is one piece makes it a little bit tricky to put on but like the design very much

Whenever I go hang out with friends they like it and it is very comfortable it is a great shoe overall

The Uncaged UBs are one of the most versatile shoes I own I can go from working 10 hours with no foot pain to hanging out with friends and still have a shoe that is perfect for any occasion

Been wearing these as my everyday shoe for work Most comfortable shoe

Great fit for me and my feet Love the feeling on my body as I walk and hike an average of 30k steps a Day Well done Adidas

Very light weight and soft on your feet Great for my planter fasciitis

Wear them everyday and they are super comfortable would recommend to friends

The shoes were bought for my 16 year old son who obsesses over his shoes He has had them one month and they are coming apart and he doesnt even wear them every day

Comfortable easy to plug in sporty outlook Mostly used in any occassion or even go to the gym

Like product just too expensive for a 13 year old

I like it because of the colors the way it looks and how comfy it feels inside the shoe but it is funny how when I move my toes the shoe also moves that is very weird feeling as I am not used to it but guess it is all about getting used to

The boost is the perfect amount of cushion for a nice ride The upper feels like a great pair of socks with laces

Was late to the Ultra Boost party but better late than never and glad I made it True to size ran too tight for me so I went half a size up and they are just right Ended up getting three colorways at once

i love the style and they are one of the most comfy sneakers have ever purchased i also recently bought the ultra boost and the cloud foams and they are awesome too

Very comfortable shoes like walking on a cloud and they look great too Very happy with this purchase I returned my first purchase to get a 1 2 size larger

Amazing comfort Order a half size up from your true size

The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn or ran in

This shows is very comfortable I particularly like the amount of cushion squish under each step

Shoe string studs irritate the top of my feet but think my feet are becoming less sensitive

I love adidas products and this shoe fits well like a glove Lightweight

These are hands down the best shoes that I have ever owned worn Really appreciate the time and effort that Adidas put into the design and styling and it shows through the finished product Quality is amazing I found nothing wrong with the Boost stitching or Primeknit and the shoes fit as expected

You get comfort and style and ultra lightness with these shoes

So bad I got a 7 5 for left and a 8 5 for right That was my brotherbirthday present and I sent it to Vietnam

Comfortable and great style They might be tight at first but will loosen up the more you wear them

THE MOST CONFORTABLE SHOES EVER I DID WALK EUROPE FOR TWO WEEKS I NEVER USED MY OTHER SJHOES

The shoes are more than what we expected The shoes are very comfortable

If you were to walk on clouds this would be the way

it is a very comfortable shoe and it is great for runs

The shoes fit and feel like a custom fitted shoe 

Shoes are very light and super comfortable I would recommend the ultra boost to anyone looking for a comfortable shoe that also looks great

I had occasional foot pain when running on pavement With these shoes I have not had any problems They are also very comfortable They are exactly what I wanted

Looks great Feels a little tight but I am guessing that is due to the sock like fit and will stretch when worn more Soles come out a little when taking the shoes off

I like this product because of how comfortable the pair of shoes is they just get dirty too fast

Amazing So comfortable and adapt to walk a lot but at the same time when you walk a lot it is you feel ther your heel is straned and hurts maybe the shooes it is too tight in that point or the balance is too overloaded in that point

I thought Ultraboost would be better than Pureboost But I do not feel any difference in comfort level compared to my Pureboost it is definitely comfortable Not sure it worths 60 bucks more

Instantly one of my most confortable shoes in my collection

The boost makes it the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Perfect fit with a super niceand fashionable look I will purchase another pair

This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever had and true size wraps around your foot perfectly

Adidas always has the best Ultraboost are the most comfortable shoe

ultra boost comfort is a game changer I need more colors like orange black or yellow black

It gives me soo much support on my feet when standing for long periods of time

Great shoes Very comfortable and light A bit pricey

Great fit Got what I was expecting Now I want another color

Shoes fit a bit small at my normal size so I recommend going at least half size larger I would have liked a bit more arch support but overall very comfortable and high quality shoe

It fits very well I like these shoes I like the way they look

when you run or walk with these shoe it feels like you are walking on clouds

I like it because it blends in with whatever clothes I am using and it feels like it is part of my body Nevertheless sometimes I start feeling pain in my feet for some weird reason I do not know

Love the fit style and the feel of this shoe I highly recommend

Love Ultraboost can not have too many pairs I will continue to wear future iterations of the Ultraboost

Great sneakers alittle pricey but so far so good

I own ALOT of Adidas many made with Boost even but these things Wow The most perfectly fitted incredibly made and comfortable shoe on the planet Not my1 go to for style even tho they look great just a little long on my narrow long feet but good God do yourself the favor and float around town work the gym wherever Bought my girl some in white cuz she loves them aesthetically and I wanted her to experience the comfort Sharin the ultraboosts comfort love Adidaslt 3 I tour playing music and spend 2 hours a night on stage and these are my new stage live ins errday

Loved Comfort design and color Bit on the expensive side

glad I made the purchase I put them on the day i bought and had roughly 20 000 steps in and felt great on feet

Reminds me of old Adidas I had in the 70s a little tight at first but loosen up

it is very comfortable lightweight It would be nice if the price is lower

These uncashed shoes suck I had hope for them I have never had another pair of shoes cut up the back of my feet so bad Then during my days walking the shoes started hurting my knees which I still have not recovered from The regular ultra boosts I have does not do any of this

Shoe is well made looks good and lasts for miles

The area around the ankle could be a bit more snug with a bit more toe box room The comfort is great shoes conforms to the foot right away

Beautiful shoe and super comfortable Would definitely buy again

When I first saw the uncage it did not appeal to me Once I saw this on sale I thought it would be a great opportunity to try on something out of my comfort zone It wasnt too long after that these grew on me I now love the looks it feels great your feet feels secure snug but a comfortable fit Its my go to shoes for training and casual outing

Awesome product totally worth the money feels like you are on a cloud

Fit and comfort are spot on These are the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned I will be buying another pair shortly

The product came in time it looked like it was advertised and fit great

These are in my opinion the best shoe line I have 4 pairs of ultra boost I started wearing them for cause I heard they were comfortable and have not stopped buying them yet The caged ultra boost do look a bit better but I only use the uncgaed ones for since we do have to run miles Honestly most comfortable shoes then any other company has

I was honestly skeptical about the low cut and ankle collar at first but after wearing them around as I have been I have learned that these might be the comfiest shoes I have ever put on They fit true to size and I have no complaints can not go wrong with Ultraboosts

Awesome shoes look great and versatile also Can wear with jeans but good for moving around as well Very light One of the best pairs of shoes I have ever had

I broke my 3 km record several times with the new shoes I just can not stop running

The shoe is very comfortable and extremely light definitely a shoe that will be recommended

Shoe is like walking in a cloud Most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased and I would highly recommend

This is my second pair as I had to retire the first pair The update styling is just as comfortable and durable as before The sizing runs small so I wear a half size larger

Its very easy to put on flexible it doesnt heat up inside so no sweating Awesome grip when running or walking I use it on cement or grass and it does not disappoint

I wish I had ordered these a half size larger I usually fit size 13 US but these were a bit of a struggle to fit in to They are overall pretty comfortable Just a note if you want to wear them without socks the seam at the back may rub against the back of your foot when running I would recommend covering it with something soft or using an adhesive bandage

Got dirty after two light wears only complaint love the shoe want more

Very comfortable and versatile feels great to walk and run with

Shoe looks amazing online but the prime knit in person looks like a thick wool sweater wish it looked like the 1 0 or 2 0 Big disappointment in person Love the ultra boost the design but the prime knit does not look good

Comfy and pretty cool when i worn them Lucky me i got 30 off

These are my first boost and I am spoiled for life I would never buy a non boost pair of shoes ever again Life is just too short to live with subpar shoes that cause you foot pain The sock top makes putting it on like wearing a sock so not easy to slip it on Will probably get another style that allows slip ons for convenience

You can not go wrong with these shoes They fit true to size And fit like the 1 0 so it is not as loose in the toe box Great shoe

The ultra boost foam on the bottom is great Combined with the sturdy sock like exterior makes it one of my best purchases from adidas The shoe is fantastic

Very comfortable everyday shoe Fits like a sock but not too tight

Adidas needs to come out with more Ultra Boost with the white heelcup As with all the 4 0 you need to go a half size up because they fit a little too snug Other then that another heater on feet Check out my IG for more picsdjdadrix

The price was acceptable

Great fit good support and a different sneaker classy style

I like these shoes because they look amazing and feel extremely comfortable

Look nice and are very comfortable I highly recommend these shoes I suffered from plantar fasciitis so I definitely need a comfortable shoe and these are perfect

The size of sneaker is bit small I recommend 5 size up

It is the perfect size and is really comfortable 10 10 overall a great shoe

Very comfortable

I have owned a pair of Adidas Energy Boost Techfit is for over 2 years They are amazing Since they were so comfortable I decided to try out the Ultra Boost this time WOW I loved my Energy Boosts but the Ultra Boosts are even better I am truly blown away by the comfort The fit it great comfort and support excellent I am a big guy at 61 245lbs and for years have struggled with my feet killing me at the end of the workday Not since swapping over to the Boosts Adidas you have earned a customer for life if you keep these going

For many years I was running in a different brands until I saw this Adidas Uncage pair I tired it on and after a few steps I knew I got to have it First test run 10K good Second midrun 21 good again I have no complaints and I would love to have another pair in a couple of month

Excellent comfort I would definitely recommend this shoe

The shoe gets a bit uncomfortable around the toe area which makes me think I ordered too small I rodered my true size so maybe going half a size up is best Otherwise great shoe

This shoe looks and feels so amazing that after wearing it for a couple days I went back on the site and ordered another pair in a different color Has a little bit of glue spots but they do not bother me

Everything about these shoes is great except that they are a pain to put on because of the soft material around the ankles

very comfortable some have written the shoe feels heavy not my experience hugs my foot but does not pinch anywhere I use these for daily exercise walking Would recommend

I really like it but it is not for me I want shoes that I can take off and put on without using my hands So I am going to go with the Caged shoes I guess

what is the difference between this and PARLEY one which they have 60 euros difference

it is good looking with any outfit I wear I love them a whole lot and I will be ordering more pairs in the future

This shoe is comfy AF but a bit narrow but that is okay because of the prime knit

Best shoe for your feet and personal comfort I have a bunch of different colorways and also a bunch of different other shoes However I only wear these The tan ones are my favorite 

I love these shoes The stretchy fabric and the neck on the shoes are amazing and very easy to slip into

Great daily shoes I would not use these for training or sports though

I work on my feet all day and they are amazing I do not train in them but working a job where I average 20k steps has become much more comfortable with these shoes

The shoe fits very comfortable and is a fashionable shoe

I like it allot pretty confortable and good looking shoe

I thought I would never find shoes more comfortable than the Caged Ultra Boosts Thought I would give it a go with the Uncaged version and to my surprise they are even more comfortable as the knit is significantly softer The lacing system is actually pretty effective so after I loosened the laces a lot I stopped feeling a bit of the snugness on the thought of the shoes as some other people have reported

Great running shoe Affordable price Very comfortable My husbands second pair

My son likes the fit and comfort of this shoe Good color scheme

super comfortable nice fit not as white in person as it looks in the photos I am okay with that

I like this shoe just because is very lightweight and comfortable

I love this colorway and I love the quality of this shoe Adidas nailed it

Adidas combines ultraboost with prime knit to make the most comfortable shoe possible The quality and craftsmanship mean they are good for the long haul and any type of runner The shoes are also definitely cool enough to wear around casually

This shoe is great for an active 10year old who usually wears his shoes out in two weeks This show is good looking modern stylish and super comfortable according to my son Adidas has definitely won our family over We all have a pair of Ultra Boost Walked around Disney Parks for hours without the slightest a ache

Its so comfy and just boost is the best type of shoe to wear

I love it For walking hands down best shoes i have ever used A tiny bit wide in the toe box but thicker socks fixes that immediately Well worth the purchase

Love the style and the fit lol I am gonna get mad if I have to write more

I would highly recommend

Normally on the pricey end but due to a sale I purchased 2 at the same time

Needless to say the uncaged holds in weight in gold to the caged version in just about every aspect with the exception of style points Trying to separate these shoes beyond that would be like comparing Batman to the Dark Knight Well done team Adidas

Went up 1 2 size because of shoe being a little narrow

This pair is super comfortable and is ultra light as well

Fits well and is super lightweight Comfortable durable and an all around sneaker for running and hiking

holy heck I do not know why I waited so long This is seriously a comfortable shoe and a huge step up from my NMD2 I love this shoe and glad I bought my first pair of ultraboosts Now I need to save up more money to get my second

Very comfortable and lots of support I really like the webbing of the shoes It gives it a snuggle feel but breathable

it is a great shoe Comfortable and stylin Just do not wear in the rain

Great shoe Very comfortable I am happy with the purchase

Unbeatable quality style and comfort Must have for any person

I love these shoes very comfortable excellent support on my feet

I did not liked how they looked but other then that it was a nice shoe

If you want a everyday shoe this is it comfort style and very light

So comfortable and fashionable to wear whether I am at the gym or out about

Awesome comfort

The uncashed version of the ultraboost is by far the most comfortable sneaker I ever wore they fit true to size BOOST IS LIFE

Shoe is good However the upper part of the shoes is too tight It is also very snug so putting it on is a little bit of work

These shoes are super comfortable The only issue was that I ordered a 7 5 my usual size because I read somewhere that they were true to size Unfortunately they were too large but I did order a size 7 and they fit perfectly Would definitely recommend these shoes

The upper on this shoe just wraps around my foot like a foot glove I sometime get wide width shoes or shoes a half size up because athletic sneakers sometimes feel too tight but these just let my feet be feet They also look great and the ultra boost is such a nice cushion

I like the boost in the ultraboost that makes them so comfortable but honestly I would prefer black boost over white if it was not as limited The shoes retain comfort but the mid soles do not stand the test of time aesthetically

great shoe to wear casually and for training in the gym

First pair of ultraboosts and I love them Definetly going to be buying more

I am constantly standing and moving at work so I am always looking for shoes that are comfortable lightweight and have great support for my flat feet

I have only had them two weeks but they have felt and performed great so far No complaints

Best shoe I have ever worn Feels like I am walking on clouds

Bought these for my son He said they fit great and loves the way they look

It is my second pair of Ultraboost and it is so comfortable It will not be my last

Extremely comfortable Colorways look great especially in the sunlight

the most comfortable shoes ever I will only buy adidas

My hubbyfirst pair of UBs and he is in love He loves them because they are comfortable and lightweight for fitness performance

It is so comfortable Most comfortable shoe ever for my walking due to my plantar fasciitis

Great pair of shoes I highly recommend them to workout or to go on a long run

Been a runner for some time now and have always ran in NB this was my first pair of Adidas running shoes This shoes are the best running shoes I have owned Fit and feel is perfect When it is time to pound the pavement have not had a better shoe

I think these are designed so you do not need socks but I still like to wear them However they pull down some socks at the heel when I walk so I have to stop and pull them up all the time

Overrated Not nearly comfortable at all Had more comfortable cheaper shoes

Comfort and design



i thought i reached the apotheosis of comfortable sneakers when i bought the caged ultraboost 3 0 but no these uncaged ultraboost take it to the next level i do not know what it is about the sock like support around the ankle but it is sooo comfortable i cant take the shoe off now literally sleeping with it

They are a everyday shoe that is really comfortable

great fit and really comfortable Wore an entire day the first day no problems

Amazing shoe Heard about ultraboosts for a while finally got a pair of my own and they did not disappoint

This shoe fits amazing Most comfortable shoes I have ever put on besides my other ultra boosts Highly recommended

Delicious my toes are so yummy now My dogs love to lick my toes nonstop and I do not have to use peanut butter now

Most comfortable shoes I have ever had looks great will buy again

Shoes look great They also feel great If you wear no show socks with it the back of the shoes rub on your skin a little bit Otherwise it is comfortable and is an excellent addition to onerotation

This is one of the best pair of shoes for running

Looks and feels great Very lightweight Sooo glad I made this purchase

Good for running walking and everyday activities The design and size is perfect

Just get it You will not regret it it is super comfortable

The color was nice and it fit very well I liked it instantly

If you need want a shoe that does everything great and checks off each category This is the one Well worth it

It was very comfortable and fit perfertly Like a slip on It would he nice if the bottom was black since white get dirty so fast

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and would recommend it to my family and friends

They are extremely comfortable for walking or running only Uncaged Ultra Boost are my go to I own several pairs because of their comfort

There is a seem that runs up the back of the heel that rests against your achilles Just walking in the shoes causes it to rub the skin blister the back of your achilles I love the regular UltraBoost shoe itself and I received these as a gift so I plan to use some sort of bandage guard to modify the shoe At the price I would not recommend them Aside from the seem everything else is great

This was my first pair of ultraboost shoes having previously worn the eqt 93 17 and nmd r2 both of which are amazing and insanely comfortable shoes I was excited to finally try what I have heard is the most comfortable shoe on the market While the boost cushioning and primeknit upper of this shoe are fantastically comfortable they are unfortunately held back due to the ankle collar The ankle collar itself is nice and it delivers on the sock like feel but its fatal flaw is the seam The seam of the collar is rough and it is positioned right over the achilles This meant that for me while wearing no show socks the collar was constantly and painfully digging into my achilles I found myself constantly trying to pull my socks over the collar to avoid the pain Is the solution to wear ankle length socksYes But that takes away from the look and I feel that you should not be forced to wear certain socks for a shoe because of a significant design flaw I am now left contemplating whether to return the shoes or not and I am most definitely wishing that I got the regular ultraboost instead

I have used these shoes for 3 runs now My first was a slow 1 5 2 mile jog My feet hurt pretty bad after the run My second and third run with the shoes I was hoping I just needed to break them in so I ran 2 3 miles The arch on my feet are still hurting and this was 3 days since my last run I switched back to my old shoes and have had to do the elliptical I do not recommend these shoes if you are running on pavement

These shoes look and feel great I may have to buy a backup pair

This is by far the best color of Ultraboost shoes I have purchased

I just got my ultra boost uncaged grey and I tried them on I have ankle high socks and they the shoes fit true I wear 9 and I was going to get a 1 2 size larger but I looked at the reviews and YouTube and they all fitted true to size I wore just hem around the house and they are really comfortable I have a wide foot so getting into them took a little longer but it was no issue for me Pretty light compared to my cloudfoam neo They are a little heavier than my cloudfoam grooves Which are my all time favorite running shoe I will run in these tomorrow to see how well they hold up to a hot asphalt So far comfort and fit are bar none

Fits TTS or possibly a half size down compared to other brands Not as comfy as my cage UBs but good nonetheless

Very comfortable dirt just gets trapped in the material but super comfy and worth the money

it is so comfortable I can run with it even play basketball with it

These shoes look great and feel even better highly recommend

Great shoes for every day wear and light workouts

Best shoes I have ever worn in terms of comfort beware of less ankle support than standard shoes

I love the Ultraboost shoe for running I have on my third pair and I would not even consider another shoe

Love the way my feet do not hurt and are still dry after wearing them all day on concrete floors

Naisu Naisu shoe Great for walking but looks best while clean so you do need to take care of it

Good shoe to to where around but Adidas has better offerings

I have two pairs of other ultra boosts that fit perfectly The sock like upper on these grip my feet a little too tightly They are still very comfortable but just be forewarned Or if the other styles are a bit too big for you these will be perfect

I am using these for jogging and they have worked perfectly

My 6th pair with Ultraboost technology These shoes are addicting After knowing them on my feet everything else is lacking Although this one is not my favorite but each model is uniquely comfortable and beneficial because of the boost technology These run A little narrow and can feel suffocating at first and needs sometime to break in and get used to and once you are adjusted they feel like an extension of yourself except with an extra BOOST They are somewhat stable but could use a little more width at least for my feet I love how shoe technology has come this far but I hate how much they cost I was telling my wife yesterday that these shoes makes me want to quit my job and go explore the world in them It would have been an even more awesome experience if I had these when I was visiting New York DC Europe etc with all the walking Only if Adidas can make these shoes more affordable for the masses so that everyone can experience this kind of comfort the world would be a happier place

Its very comfortable Im very happy I hope so I get new ones soon thank yuo

Right out of the box these were the best shoes I have ever worn 5 5 would buy again

I like the product because it fulfills everything you look for in a sneaker

It is not made to be durable or to stand in different type of weather like rain or dust there is no safe cover for the toes as the fabric is so not protective in the toes area the toes will dig through the material in no time Also the shoes is tight around the arch up side but longer on the tip toe like a dress shoes leaving extra space beyond the toes even at the right size As a life long adidas fanatic this generation of sneakers is a total disappointment

Very comfortable shoes really good quality great size

The design is terrific but run too narrow for me

These shoes are great

I can not recommend these shoes enough They fit perfectly and are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They are also the lightest shoes I have tried on

They looke great and were very comfortable but my feet always felt like they were going to fall off the soles to the sides Maybe if the upper was not so stretchy but my feet did not feel secure in the shoes

Boost is a very comfortable material and the prime knit without the cage makes your foot feel more free The Ultra Boost Uncaged can be worn for fitness and running or just a casual everyday shoe The continental rubber is amazing on concrete and outdoor surfaces but inside a basketball gym be prepared to slip

Amazing shoes I can not believe how conftable they are Little bit pricey but do not regret purchasing these ahoes

The shoe is a quality show with a lot of padding However the padding seems to slope to the outside of the shoe which hurts my feet when I run or workout with the shoe They are comfortable when I walk in them but not for running or working out

Very comfortable and attractive shoes They provide great support and are very light

Great shoes but way too narrow in width Had to buy half size bigger than my normal size and after a day of using them I still have a problem around the toes

As any other Ultraboost shoe this is the best and most comfortable shoe to ever exist I have owned so many Ultraboost but for some reason this particular model is super tight at the toebox that it hurts my big toe The upper made of a fantastic primenet but still really annoying at the toe area

Yes very comfortable and responsive whether walking or running

Hugs feet comfortable springy durable Running in shoes over a year and have no complaints They are very light weight

Amazing comfort by far the price might be high but the quality is the best

Super comfortable shoe I wear these almost everywhere I go They look great and slip on super easy I do not wear them for short runs less than 6km but for my 10km and half marathon training they are absolutely a joy to run in These shoes are heavier than most light runners but really give you a plush comfy feel when you are on long runs

Bought these shoes for working out They are perfect for any kind of activities within a gym setting

The shoes feel like you are not even wearing any shoes but hey are still comfortable

Love the way they look and feel on feet I do not use them for runninghowever for walking they are very comfortable The knit is super comfortable and does not rub on your skin at all They breath well and are light for having so much boost Very happy with this purchase

Comfortable glove like fit Lightweight I would say darn near perfect if you want to run a marathon I went from not being a runner to running 50 miles per week and have not had a single foot issue along the way

The most comfortable sneaker I have ever bought Will be buying a lot more of this style

Comfortable shoes and look good but Primeknit gets dirty easily

I got the black and white color It looks classy and very comfortable However one biggest flaw is that the Continental rubber sole gets beat up pretty quickly I really take care of my shoe I have mostly used it for a street walk and wore in office no intense runs or workouts so far The dust particles get stuck inbetween rubbers and on the white cloudfoam which is harder to clean I wish the rubber sole was little stronger and thicker Overall if you care about fashion and function go for this shoe but keep in mind the flaw

Super comfortable shoes Great for lifestyle and for running Boost is the best

I started to see review videos online about the Ultraboost sneakers a few months ago Kept hearing about the comfort of the shoes and especially the boost soles So went to a shoe store to try one on Immediately they were the most comfortable shoes I have worn thus far I am several years late to the Ultraboost party but I will gladly take being late than never experiencing it at all My heels start to hurt fairly quickly but with Ultraboost shoes that does not happen I am also slowly starting to replace my other brand shoes with different Ultraboost colorways and silhouettes

Adidas Ultraboost is the end all be all in comfort and style Thank you Adidas

really great shoe so comfortable great design perfect

I am a size 15 with a wide foot so at first everything was kinda tight and uncomfortable But once the shoe stretched to fit my shoe it has become the most amazing and most comfortable shoe I love it this is my second pair I bought and I just got a third High quality shoe with beautiful colors You get what you pay for

you need to make in very wide 4e or more Many of your shoes are not good for people with wide feet

I personally have two Ultraboosts I had to get another one recently because the first one I bought I broke down pretty bad after a year of constantly wearing it to the point where I can hear the soles cracking every time I walk I thought it was just because that specific product that was bad but the second boost that I have gotten pretty recently allowed me to reach to the same conclusionsif you are very active with these shoes the soles will crack pretty quick Durability wise it is horrible But otherwise in regards to comfort and design it is an excellent product

love these bought them for my husband for fathers day and he LOVES them

I love these shoes They have great support They look amazing They fit like a glove They make exercising so much more comfortable

Because the are so comfortable and the are very good for walking and running

Good product fitting is OK Material is sub standard not worth the price

I like these because they are very comfy and stylish

I have a pair of caged and the winter uncaged and like the uncaged better This is a great shoe for the warmer weather

I am worried how long they will last They feel nice but not sure if the material is made for everyday use

I like to run long distances and from all running shoes that I have tried so far these are the best I could run a marathon every day and have my legs not tired or sore with these shoes Only thing that I would like to see these with black color Ultra Boost cushioning reason because white Boost cushioning gets dirty quite easily and it is not easy to make it white again Other than that really great shoes so far the best running shoes I have ever had I will be getting second pair of these definitely Adidas please do not stop making these ever

This was my first Adidas purchase in years Was impressed with the ultraboost comfort Shoe is my go to if I am walking around all day or if I want to run You will not be disappointed

Perfect for running fits perfectly on my foot and is very comfortable

The laces pinch the top of the foot where tied Shoe is uncomfortable

I love ultraboost it is so comfortable and simple I can wear it all day long it is so much airy and comfy that my shoes never smells it is very durable too The uncaged version is perfect for daily casual west and running The caged is great for running It feels like you are wearing only your socks

Very comfortable but I am a little worried if these are okay to use in the rain

Great shoe comfortable I will buy another pair Delivery was fast and efficient

These are the best My relationship with nike is over it is like wearing a sock and standing on a giant gel pad Love love love

they were for the grandson and he wears them for his work as a nurse

Comfortable shoes true to size But gave me no support Had to return them for the regular ultraboost Also the sock like sleeve makes it kinda difficult to slip your foot through and the ridges around it were rubbing at my ankles Maybe I just got a bad pair Like I said I returned them for the REGULAR Ultraboost and I am highly pleased with those

Most comfortable shoes I own Love them Great quality and worth the price

Best pair of ultraboost More comfortable than the original boosts I am a barber on my feet 12 hours a day no exaggeration These are a game changer

Great performance show for those folks that live in a pedestrian centric city as I do Walked 5 miles in these shoes on Day 1 and was in love Comfortable fit and I have just been pulling them on and off with the shoe tied Love them so much ordering same shoe in another color way

The shoes were one of my better purchases I have ever made the shoes are comfortable and affordable at the time

Love the shoes Need new laces after my dog chewed my aglets Where can I find the red laces online or in NYC

Thanks Will definitely buy more

i got the for my husband and once he saw them he felt in love he didnt that i ordered them he said that they perfect size really confy

I purchased them during mid last year but within almost 8 months the shoe sole has worn out I can see a big crack on both boost shoe soles I do not use the shoe on regular basis just for normal wear two to three times a week They are great for comfort but bad on quality

I had these shoes for about 6 months and they were incredible until someone saw them in am bag and took them be careful with your shoes

Perfect comfort and even more as time paces Great grip when running

Everyone I work with has been switching to adidas from Nike for comfort I finally bought a pair they are super comfortable but the ankle part for the sock like part digs into my left ankle Seems to be loosening up with time but gave me a blister first couple wears

absolutely the most comfortable shoe I have worn in a long time the design of the show was also great to look at I received a lot of compliments on them Price wise it was a bit much but worth it in the end

Not bad sneaker just a little smaller than nmd

These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn The fit is perfect the cushioning is perfect and the liner makes the fit feel snug Lightweight and breathable These are truly a revelation Highly recommend They look good too

This product is really great as it fits well around the feet but I myself had to go half a size up for them not to be too tight I tried them in the store before the purchase and found that it was too long if I went half a size up but there was no drag as your foot was secured by the sides of the shoe Overall a great purchase that I will be happy to recommend to friends and family or anyone that asks

I like this product because it is very comfortable

The most comfortable show I have ever worn I recommend this brand to anyone who wants comfort

The shoe looks very stylish and is generally comfortable but feels a little unsecured on your foot and the back of the sock collar definitely rubs against my ankle You have to have a sock stick out to avoid that

These shoes give you feet the Bankhead Bounce Light comfortable and great ventilation

Because Ultra BOOOOOOOOOST And they are the best pair of shoes since forever

If you wear inserts or your someone who needs their running shoe to fit tightly then this is not the shoe for you I wear orthotics and this version of the ultra boosts does not have enough support to tighten the shoe from moving while running The constant movement made my run feel as if the shoe would fall off and my orthotics created a very large blister The shoe itself is great Very comfortable If this does not pertain to you I am sure you will love them

I like the fit of the shoe the color is popping and the the uncaged style is one of my favorite for a quick and comfortable slip on

The comfort when wearing the shoes was amazing but the flyknit sucks On the left shoe the flyknit tore within the first week of wearing them I have had them for a month and now the flyknit on the right shoe had tore Would not recommend for everyday use

Great style nice fit love them Awesome purchase

The shoes came with a snag in the toe box I would expect better quality from Adidas

Once you get the right size they are great to have on your feet I did have to return the first pair and order another size 10 5 I really do not understand their sizing I also have a pair of NMDand the 9 5 fist perfectly I think the difference is because the NMDdo not have a insert and the Ultra Boost does to that bumps the size by 1

Really nice and comfortable shoe I do prefer the caged ultra boost over these but these are still very good overall

Comfy cushion socklike fit is nice for casual wear laid back or for trainers to walk in but too snug needed heel tabs like the soccer Aces Overall they are nice needs break in time or half size up

They are exactly as described The recipient described them as the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned

My mom got me this pair of shoes for my birthday and I was so happy to revive another pair of ultra boost uncaged shoes because my last pair is still going pretty strong But this pair the boost separated from the bottom of the fabric after 5 runs

The shoe is great in terms of quality but I have wide feet If it were a bit wider it would be 100 comfortable but to my narrow feet people this shoe would be fantastic for you

Probably one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever owned Also since it shares the boost technology with nmdyou can use the insoles on these shoes for the nmdto make them a lot more comfortable

One of the most comfortable pair of shoes i own the are great for athletics or for casual wear They fit a little snug on me so if you have wider feet i would recommend the caged ultra boost rather than the uncaged

The Ultraboost Uncaged in my opinion is one of the best running shoes there is As a basketball player and someone who likes the look of basketball shoes these shoes looked kinda weird when I first got them but they are growing on me Everything about the shoe is great except for the support If you do a quick change of direction your foot slides off the footbed causing it to basically come off the side of the shoe Other than that it is great

FYI Adidas has relabeled the size of this shoe For example If you fit a size 10 approximately 8 10 months ago you all probably need 9 1 2 I have custom orthotics size 10 and they fit perfectly in my previous 5 pair these new pair they fit in the 9 1 2 not the 10 I measured both my old pair and both the new 9 1 2 and 10 and the now 9 1 2 measures exactly as my old size 10 These shoes are tight at first almost too tight However after walking around the house with no socks for a couple of hours they started to loosen up I have an width foot and I can not wear these with a thick or medium cushioned sock I bought several pair of ultra thin sport socks which work great and help wick moisture It took approximately 40 hours of wear to fully break in I subtracted 1 star due to the relabeling of their sizes and having to reorder

I like the quality comfort style and everything about this shoe but if you like to flex your shoes only legit sneakerheads know what these are

You fell like that you are in the clouds

Very pleased with my order but why does the picture show hits of green and the one I got are orange

Perfect shoes and very comfartble I would definitley recommended for others go fo it

Its comfortable for me all day I just love this shoe

I love how comfortable it is while still allowing an athletic ability I was hesitant about the price but they were worth it

Shoe fits very well materials fell very nice and the shoe is comfortable

Great running shoe comfortable and stylish Have worn these out all day before running in them to get a feel for them Almost purchased another just for daily wear

I really am enjoying my new pair of Shoes All my friends had Ultra Boost so I though I would get a pair Originally I REALLY loved the comfort of the Shoes because it feels like you are walking on AIR which is just an amazing feeling Quality is GREAT The look of the Shoes is also GREAT I ordered a 10 5 when really my Shoe size is approximately a 10 but since I have growing feet I really hope these Shoes last me a long time Overall I am VERY happy with this product Thank you Adidas

tag in back by heel is not comfortable and rubs a little bit

I like this product because it looks good and is very comfortable Strongly recomended

It makes me happy to slide these bad boys on They are super comfortable Worth getting it one size bigger as with some of the other boost i have purchased are tight I wear a 13 have wider then normal feet Getting the 14 100 worth it If your looking for a pair of UltraboostUncaged is the way to go

Comfortable shoe for running I like the cushion and sock like fit

Good comfort rank a bit big but was a great purchase and worth the money Use them to work out all the time light and great for running Wear easily

I am a return customer due to quality the fit and the look

I now own two pairs of ultraboost These are by far he most comfortable shoe I have ever put on and definately the best looking I hope they come out with some new color ways and stuff like that I am DEFINATELY getting another pair and recommend these

The best Love your product Never leaving you guys

i really like the shoe performance and style wise but size is slightly small would recommend it

Light unbelievably comfortable great cushion sole and look great Love that they slip on and feel like wearing socks but it does take getting used to a different feel Really happy with these I was 100 Sambas before these ultra boost sneakers

I feel like I am walking in a mattress These shoes are amazing and I love are the best shoes I have ever worn

Super comfortable shoes For wider feet go half size up

Was sceptical about spending so much for a pair of shoes but it was money well spent 3 straight 12 hour shifts and I could not be happier Love the look and feel Plan on getting another pair and recommending to all my coworkers

Great shoes easy to rock and super comfy I will have a hard time trying to wear any other type of shoe that does not have the same amount of comfort as boost

I got these ultraboosts because of what i had heard about them They were a great price too The perfect shoes

This is one of the most comfortable shoeout there and the fastest shipping very impressed thank you Adidas

the shoes are way too long and it does not provide enough support

My new favorite shoes I will be buying more for sure

Love the color love the fit looks and feels good

These shoes are amazing Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves them The shipping was so fast and it arrived 3 days before the estimated day

It is comfortable durable and perfect for sports

These shoes are supper comfortable and look amazing but I would recommend that you go up a 1 2 a size because they run a little small

Wearing them for a week made me not want to go back to other shoes that I have such as the Adidas NMDs I did not like how the color looked the first time I got them but I grew to like them every time I wore them Such a great shoe for comfort

Wearing my uncaged ultraboosts is like walking on a cloud it is truly amazing

Hello I buy a lot of stuff from you guys but never have I cam upon a big name brand shoe like this I bought the ULTRABOOST UNCAGED SHOES After wearing them for 3 4 days the insole have been worn out and the outside is not like what it was on day one This usually starts happening to me after 6 months wearing the shoes but this is not the quality of shoes I bought

Great looking shoe but it is not very good for real running Great for everyday use though

If you want a more loose fit go up a size but if your okay with a more tight shoe go with a size you wear regularly A little to tight for my comfort but definitely go up size But they look great Definitely will buy another paid

Gave as a gift Got rave reviews and he wears them often

I do like the product just that one of my shoes was not well manufactures because when I walk my Achilles tendon left foot hurts and to use it I have to put on a band aid that the only thing because i love all my purchase that is I had made with you 9 purchase to be exactly

Shoe is very comfortable but I have to return it its narrow and need one size up for slightly wider foot Its not true to size

This shoe is light supportive and very responsive

Loved the shoe but unfortunately it was a 5 size too small for me and was either lost or stolen during the return process Definitely regret sending these back Great shoe

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn slick design bought three more

Even though it has some cage it is amazingly comfy

best comfort shoe on the planet great for jogging

I had my first boost experience with the NMD 1and was waiting for the ultra boost to go on sale and I am glad I bought them I have a wide foot and the cushion from the boost is amazing and the shoe molds to my foot Best shoe I have purchased and am thankful for boost

these shoes make my runs feel very comfortable with continental soles I am not afraid of the slippery road or dry plus the torsion system that makes me more stable while running jogging and boost that makes it more comfortable thanks adidas I hope I can get another ultraboost with a best comfortable

Ever since I bought the Hardens I was all like The boost in the shoes are sooo comfortable just imagine the boost in a running shoe then I went out looking for the perfect pair and I now I found them

Great Shoes Please Restock In Size 15 White White Grey

I love the boost line however these sock top shoes rub on my heel on runs I stick to the regular shoe style and they are deadly good

Most comfortable since my first pair of Boosts

Once you wear these shoes you are never going back These shoes are so comfortable and perfect in every way After wearing these shoes and you go put on another shoe you are going to notice all of its perfections instantly

I think because i am Asian guy and my foot is wide that i have to use this until it wide than i can use this better

If I could I would wear these everyday These are the most comfortable and also very stylish I picked up the black grey and white upper with black colored boost sole get and constant compliments I did go down a 1 2 size from my Energy Boost 1 and 2s which was perfect I wanted a snugger fit since these are uncaged

I love this product put after a while the boost on the midsole gets scuffed up and torn up a little I still recommend tho

Love these shoes Wear them basically everyday definitely reccommend

I have the Yeezy 350 iniki alphabounce ultraboost 3 0 and these are the best shoe I have tried They are way comfortable and it seriously feels like wearing a sock with boost glued to the bottom My feet do not hurt after running in these and I think it fixed my gate a little bit because of the sole shape They are amazing and fit me true to size 11 5

Shoes came in extremely quick and in remarkable condition They looked better than I expected and more so comfortable

After going to crossfit for two weeks the boost crumbled and the upper separated from the midsole None of my other ultraboosts have had this problem

It has good material and it is like if your wearing socks there so comfortable I would recommend this

These are really an AMAZING shoe I am 185cm and 70 kg and I can pound as hard as I want and the shoes totally absorb the shock The 100 knit upper gives the mopst amazing feel to a shoe I have ever had There is zero resistance in any angle of movement yet the upper does control your foot well The boost sole moves nicely with your foot as well you never feel like you are fighting the shoe I did my first run in them and immediately ordered a second pair to put into roation

Fits perfect on foot sizing is true to size extremely comfortable sole and very light so your foot does not get tired

not comfortable for the price I paid They look better on the site versus in person

If you are planning to wear these with no shows with shorts think again They look pretty terrible if you do not have long pants on due to the cuff squeezing your ankle They are pretty comfortable I expected more from the boost but they are good for running in straight lines If you are wanting to do something turn intensive basketball think again These shoes have no horizontal support and when quickly turning the sole will slip out from under your foot due to the stretchy primeknit on the side The boost wears pretty easily and looks kinda nasty but other than that they have held up pretty well No frays or anything on the primeknit which is nice

The product becomes part of your body and I think it is great

They are very stylish I really liked much cushion they have on the inside

Anyone complaining about size being to small take the insole out and allow your foot to relax on the boost material which will also be giving you that little extra bit of room you are needing Great purchase

The Uncaged Ultra boost are a little tight when I received them hope they will relax and loosen up a little

These are great Comfortable quality built and look clean I went half a size down personally I will definitely be buying some UB 4 0s when they come out personally not a fan of the 3 0 cages

These are fantastic shoes i wear them all day and my feet will not hurt i would not use these for running because the cushion in my opinion is not enough but for walking and everyday use as well as the gym they are perfect and look amazing

Best shoe from adidas that I have and note go true to size good

These are awesome shoes super comfortable Might not be the best choice if you have a particularly wide food I do not have a wide foot and these really hug your feet I ordered my typical gym shoe size and it was spot on I am really happy with this purchase Might get another pair

I did not like the shoes cause it hurt my feet really bad everytime I put them on it is not even 5 minutes my feet start to killing me because of rubber is really tie

No cause I ordered the shoes twice and they were both defective

The shoes were tight at first but are really comfortable I would recommend buying thin mid cut socks with these shoes

Amazing quality shoe super comfortable and I personally love the socklike look of it also you may be fine going down a half size

It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn but the stitches cam out on the toe

The shoe is comfortable and light but the stitches came off the front of the shoe Very disappointed

the shoe is tight in the beginning but gets more comfy

The shoe is comfortable i love the feel of primknit its not a bad shoe if you only to travel in a forward direction they have no side support in the boost sole the shoe has buckled sideways on me several times The rubber sole is possibly too thin it broke down in only a few weeks wear leaving the boost midsole to crack and separate quickly not happy with these especially for this high of a price

such a comfortable shoe one of the best shoes

These shoes are comfortable stylish and my favorite color I had to have them I would definitely suggest others purchasing them They are like walking on a cloud

Shoes are pretty comfortable Toe area is little tight I even ordered a half size up I found thinner socks helped fit Otherwise great shoe

Very nice pair of shoes unique and eye catching material used reminds me of shedded snake skin and fish scale due to the iridescent rainbow effect Comfortable and true to size sleek through out and bulky but plush air bubble at heel that gives you a tilted and or slanted stance feel

This is a unique shoe That air bubble is even bigger in person almost too big But the shoe does look and feel better in person Depending on the colorway it is very stylish Since it is a rather bulky shoe I think darker colors will look better It does fit true to size and may be a little snug for some but remember this is bulky shoe so you do not want your feet to look like you are standing on big rafts Overall not a bad shoe I recommend trying them on first as they do feel different

I love the Nike 720 I have 4 pair they feel great it feels like you are gliding on air and they make you look and feel taller very nice shoes my only complaint is that I just purchased the BLUE Nike 720 but the air bubble is lavender or lilic the shoe is still a beautiful shoe the picture of the shoe air bubble is light blue

The all volt green colorway I could not wait to drop Picked them up immediately I really can not comment on the fit because the color is likely the least volt I have ever seen The toebox area honestly looked more like a mustard yellow than volt The laces are true volt and the contrast is shocking Sent back immediately Looks nothing like the photos HUGE bummer

I got the Sunrise pair in a 12 my normal size The upper is not very flexible like I was expecting Were the laces start at the bottom was hurting my feet as they are slightly wide Ordered a 12 5 same issue I would love to see Nike make these with the 270 stretch boot sock or like the 270 Bowfin upper Then I feel that they would fit perfectly and i would have to buy several pairs do not get me wrong love my Nikes only shoes that I buy and wear

This shoe looks very cool It has great cushioning however there is not much ventilation so if you wear them for I while your feet will get hot Also they are not joking about it being a tall airbag I am 5 normal but I am 6 with these shoes on But during the time I have had them I have been really happy and gotten lots of compliments

I bought them first day kill my feet without question But as I wear them This is my 5th They are getting comfortable by the minute

The colorway for the other Throwback Future releases should have been on this 720 It would have looked SO much better and probably be sold out by now That greenish glitter is just not in right now

I have had many different pairs of Air Max shoes from the 360to Flyknit Air Maxes and all were some of the most comfortable shoes I had at the time I ordered these thinking they would be the same Not the case They are very heavy and the uppers are stiff The Air sole is really only noticable if you try to land on your heels as you walk Otherwise the only thing they do is make you feel like you are walking in high heels Due to the stiffness of the uppers it made them feel uncomfortable fairly quickly It was hard for me to do but I had to return them based on these issues They do look cool and feel durable but looks can only get you so far The Vapormax is a way more comfortable shoe and I would recommend you look there if you want a bold Air Max style Nike

I went to the mall today with the intent of seeing these for myself and at first glance they are HUGE but for some reason when I put them on I really could not tell that they were big at all I will not be the one to wear them with shorts but with jeans on they were perfect do not believe the hype go try them on and see for yourself Definitely true to size for me size 12

Feels very small it is the right length but so very tight in the toe due to an aggressive slope Though half sizes are available in womenand small mensizes larger options are whole size only Vapor Max Plus feels perfectly true to size This feels similar to the Air Max 97 QS in that it is too small for a 13 and a 14 would be too large Not sure if these are worth developing corns on my toes

The look of these are awesome Got my husband a pair and I got the sunset 720s we love everything about them Definitely would recommend

i recently purchase to workout in the gym the sneaker actually feels great on my heel and mid sole but after so time my toes feel like really tight in the shoes which is quite disappointing because i really like the look and concept

Great shoe Colors looked as advertised Very comfortable and soft in inside If you are between sizes I suggest you go up We were between the 10 5 and 11 Normally in Jordanit is a 10 5 In these 11 fit perfect

From the pictures the sneaker looked cool I received them today and the ombre is very discolored you can see all the glue coming out the crevices they are also huge Like space boot type I am 5 feet and purchased them in a 7 5 and it looks like I am wearing a size 13

Very comfortable shoe affordable love all the 6 ring shoes my 4th purchase Love all the colors very pleased with this shoe

These might be the best Jordan out there I think the Air Jordan 11 are amazing But these are a mix of a few Jordan together and they are better than the original I got them in all black and I can not decide which ones are better Get compliments every time I wear them Best

My daughter she said they are SO comfortable All I needed to know

I am an avid sneaker head and these are some of my favorite Great fit and do not make your feet too hot Can be casual but can also be used to hoop Overall an amazing shoe

The design is a combination of the shoes that MJ wore during his 6 NBA Ch and Ionships Hence the name 6 Rings The midsole and outsole are the same as on the Air Jordan 13

Shoe feels weird not comfortable good style and colour tho

I have bought this shoes for my brother and he loves them

I ordered the ones with navy blue When i wear them I have to wear like really thin socks because they feel more comfortable

Had a pair of the 6rings about 5 years ago Best bball shoe I have ever had Then I got these

Love the shoes and the quick delivery Other sites had the shoes I wanted but could not touch deliver time with having to verify authenticity but direct from the maker and enjoy your shoes week before others

They fit very well overall These are definitely the ones I would buy again They fit almost perfect it came a bit bigger than I expected but they look great They go with almost anything I have in my closet and they are a head turner And a girl pick upper if that is what you want

These are my favorite pair they fit perfectly and look amazing

hi Nicke please launch this shoe to India or please provide me at any cost I will be thank full to you

These shoes took my breath away Material on shoes is on point Shoe looks and feels amazing Comfortable to walk in Bought them due to the color and style and I was not disappointed Runs true to size I would really recommend these sneakers Thank you nike for restocking

REALLY GOOD SNEAKER LOVED THE JORDAN 11 AND 13 ASPECTS

Got all three pairs love them received boots and awesome too cant wait for more Jordans to come out so I can get my addiction fix and add to my Jordan collection

these shoes are highly recommended because of great style and great comfort

yo this is crazy i got mine like 2 days ago but i hadnt worn them i jus wore them 2nite on a date she was lovin them im bout to get the boots next cuz i still wanna rock these even when snow get on the ground they are super comfortable nd extremely stylish the glove inside is cray lol

these shoes are very stylish love the way they look

They are HOT I like the carbon fiber look they gave to them Jordanstay classics even after Michael Jordan and his washed up self aint playing anymore

You may need to get it a half size to 1 size bigger than your natural size because of the inner sock but is super comfortable and adjusts to the shape of your foot be careful not to crease

The Paint easy has scrape and not very fit my feet

love the varisty royal color had to get these because they are as comfortable as my HOF 6 Rings thanks Jordan and Nike

these shoes are incredible cant wait to ball in them

THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ORDERING 6 RINGS AND THEY LOOK NICE THE REASON I GOT THEM BEACUSE THEY WHERE CHEAP BUT THEY LOOK NICE AND VERY COMFORTABLE

I originally loved the shoe but I hate the glove inside It makes it very difficult to put your foot in The shoe does not even need the laces the glove holds your foot in Without the foot glove the shoe would be perfect I thought it would be a little more comfortable but it is probably the glove once again

I like this shoe and all of the others in the six ring model good looking and very comfortable

i love how these jfeel on the court they are comfortable and easy to move in for me

just got my six rings and when I used it for ballin it is really COMFORTABLE This is my first Jordan shoe and it is like having 6 shoes in 1 this shoe is really AMAZING I had doubts before buying the shoes not the best looking shoe but I do think this is the BEST shoe for BALLIN

this is one of the best pair of jordans i have the are great for walkin or playin basketball

i have a pair of the utah jazz six rings they are the rarest ones of them all i love the style and the comfort in the shoe i think jordan did the best job and could not do anything to make them better

i like these shoes because im a air jordan fan ive been wearing air jordans since i could remember my kids will carry on the tradition and so forth

These are my second pair of Jordans that i have gotten brand new Just got them today and i love the colors on them They match just about anything and the purple is not nearly as noticable on the stitching as they are in pictures Very comfortable and fit perfect Even though the upper that is not so up where patient leather is supposed to be not sure what its called is not patient leather it still looks really good

great shoes very comfortable worth the money Get creased at the bottom but there more of a collectors edition

The 6 rings shoes are dope Super snug and comfortable Highly recommend

The air jordan 6rings were tight I received my order in only a couple of days Thanks Nike

one of the best shoes made good fit comfortable looks good on your feet if only they still had the black and red onei would two or three pairif nike really want to make some money on these they would keep them in stock keep up the good work nike

Most comfortable pair of jordans i have ever owned

i only wore the shoes once but let me tell ya there maddd comfortable and fit perefectly in my opinion the color scheme is the sickest in the whole 6 ring collection they shipped in 5 days and i was happy with nike customer service i rate these shoes a 10 out of 10 if you could get ur hands on a official pair buy them

i have 2 pair so far and will get the utah version next i love them both on and off the court best combo he came out with yet

I love them cant wait to get the new ones these are my favorite jordans that has come out in a long time keep up the goodf work nike and jordan the only gripe i have is they need to be more asseable

Alot of people always complain that Jordans cost way too much but trust me these shoes were worth every penny They are sure show stoppers

I went way out of my way to get these beauties This color way is one of the nicest made and can go with almost anything If you sleep on these they will be gone in no time

I have enjoyed owning the Jordan 6 rings basketball shoe so far They are comfortable easy to wear and best of all patent leather easy to take care of The color scheme was an excellent choice for me as they brought me into a different direction from the colors that I would normally wear I like the design of the shoe and it is overall look The only downside was the style of the opening which made the shoe a little difficult to get on but once in them the feel of the shoe lets you know that you are wearing a Jordan brand shoe

i love these shoes They are so comfy The color matches the hat i purchase also

Jordan ring 6 could be the best made shoe so far Durability is great comfort is ok but well suited for anyone I only wear it in a indoor court only Great for ballers MUST GET MORE THEN ONE PAIR MUST

I HAVE THE BLACK ON WHITE BLACK ON PURPLE AND NOW THSES AND I AM BUYING MORE THANKS NIKE AND MIKE KEEP MAKING MMORE PLZS

i love these shoes they are stylish and easily maintainable they run a little small but overall they are some of my favorite shoes

Sold out quick just because everything about it is perfect Fits great good comfort durable but its better for style than court use

they are a little more than i wanted to spend but once i tried them on i had to get them a bit more comfortable than the hyperdunks woth every cent

I ordered these online and got a size 11 5 based on other peoples feedback even though i normally wear an 11 in AF1and other Jordans I would definitely say that the shoes run narrow as the 11 5fit me perfectly Shoes look beautiful very high quality materials and construction They are hard to get on your foot initially but once they are on they are very comfortable

I have these along with the Portland  and also will be getting the Phoenix  and jazz6 Rings Shoes are straight FIRE Pictures do not do the shoes justice you must see them in person to appreciate it is true beauty Laser detail is immaculate Definitely an AWESOME Shoe and a MUST Copp Celebrate Jordanlegacy by getting these kicks you will not regret

have everything in one shoe is what you get whith the six rings they so confortable and light the are perfect for the game once again another great shoes

These are the HOTTEST pair that came out do not know why its the portland should have been the bulls but it works for me Cant wait for the next couple of rings come out

these are so coo i just got a pair nd luckly i was the right size cuz thats all that was left they are so comphy great overall shoe

These shoes are awsome they look cool and feel great I like them more even then my hyperdunks A great buy

This is by far one of the best colorways of the Jordan six rings Alot of people are hatin on them but I personally love them The shoe is overall very comfortable and has a great look I would have to rank this six rings 3rd overall behind the Utah Jazz edition dropping in march and the Laser edition Great work JB

There great had to have but will wait to the summer to rock them

The best shoe yet Great fit Colors clean and bright not over the top

I really love this shoe I have worn them twice now and they are comfortable and look great Besides from lasers and the first 6ix rings the black red these are the best ones to come out Cannot wait for the Portland Trailblazer ch and Ionship pack

Some People Realy Like These And Others Really Hate Them I Luv Them They Fit Great And Are Really Comfortable The Can Match Anything You Wear

Overall a great shoe Very comfortable and performs well on the court

i got da olympics dis is a great shoe its just that the ones were kinda different they aint fake cause i got them off nike com anyway mines had a blue and red lace lock not a white one mine were white in between da blue on da bottom lastly the grey fuzz on dese was blue on mine

They are my first pair of Jordans and I hope that not the last because I became a JB fan

Fit perfect Love The support Color is hot Had to cop 3 pairs Just so Lovely Quality shoe Highly recommended if you can find them in your size MWHAHA HAH HAAA

I got these 2 day jan 24 09 djare hot they do run kinda small but they are fine too me

i just got these today 1 23 09 in a size 12 and they are really comfortable and they look nice too i know their has been some questions on size and let me tell you these are tight around the heels ankles i do not mind it but some people might i also have the dark army ones in a 12 5 and that just gives you more room for your heels but i do not find that much of a difference in size besides it being bigger its all personal preference i have read in other forums and blogs that people hate on these shoes cause they ugly and let me tell you these are nice looking in person for those who are thinking about getting these i highly recommend it

The she has a perfact fit and is tight and snugg on my feet It has great support for basketball The only negative thing is that the color is UGLY and its an EYE SORE

These are so comfortable Really amazing and durable they look great too The White Vaarsity Red Navy and black is my favorite bhey did not have my size = So i settled for the white navy red nd metallic These are still amazing

super comfy and durable on the court i play varsity basketball and i never slip on the court and i get alot of comments

these are sexy nice colors more sexy and great for playing on the court i have been ballin ever since i got these shoes

These are great shoes instant classic status Was a little disappointed though 2 small cuts in the patent leather on the front but overall ok

the shoes are great color wave they real comfortable and alot people ask me about them lovin dese 

i love there jordan they match with some of everything even though the do have a bit of purple in the nut they are tight and you will not see eyerybodt walking around with the on get them iff you got the dollars

Great shoe Feels comfortable and I love the concept of the six Jordanmeshed into one

These are great ball shoesbut they run a half size small They fit similar to the Dubs in that regards The 6 Rings are also seem to hold up like a real ball shoe seem to be durable so far

My favorite shoes for basketball They are super comfortable and have good grip on the soles They look alot like the AIR JORDAN 11 I had to get 2 pairs

I got all 5 and absolutely love them they feel so great on the feet and they also look great on the feet the suede was just perfect with the armys

This is the best shoe i ever owned and i have 11 pairs of shoes

These Jare SICK TIGHT I couldnt wait to get them Best I ever spent My favorite in my whole collection So Comfy too I just love them

These are some of the best JB shoes EVER The sole midsole from the 13 make for a wider footbase and are super comfortable Match that with the aesthetics from all six Jordans used and you have a perfect shoe

These are a must have these are very comfortable at first it wuz tight but it got loose enough after i wore it a couple times THESE are A MUST HAVE

These feel as good as they look They almost look too good for my game I enjoy how they feel on my feet as well

Well this shoe is a gem among the recent hybrid jordans IMO Fit is great for on court performance The sole is solid with good traction on indoor courts Very comfortable and worth every penny I am looking forward to the upcoming colorways for the 6 rings this shoe is a keeper

I had to go get this shoes I got them a week after they came out and I NEVER buy jordans if I do not get them the day they come out They run small but besides that they are a elite shoe all the way Thanks Jordan

it reminded me of the very first pair my dad bought me they are to be at the highest level

cleanest kicks ever Nike did it again with these jordan hybrids ive been a faithful customer since the 88 and with styles like these coming out you can bet im going to be loyal for years to come

I am not a fan of the recent line of the fusion Jordan concept I like them to be as original as possible However the 6 rings set itself apart from all of the rest These are entirely too nice to be worn out on a court I am extremely pleased with these shoes The only thing that I do not like is they do require a little effort to get into and the area around the ankle is a little tight snug If you where this shoe all day that area my be little sore it is a clean shoe the design is not busy and overwhelming The shoe does not look cheap and maintains a stylish level cooI by keeping the the color scheme basic but classic I seriously doubt that I will ever truly break these shoes in I only wear them once a month and they currently reside in my closet on the self can not go wrong with patent leather This is an excellent shoe

AWESOME BABY Get them on your feet as soon as you can

VERY NICE LOOKING SHOE I HAVE THE ELEVENS AND THEY LOOK SIMILAR FROM FAR BUT DIFFRENT FROM CLOSE VERY NICE SHOES IF YOU do not GOT them GET them

A comfortable shoe to wear everyday You can play ball in them or go on the town in them You have to have these shoe if you are a true Jordan fan

Im not saying these are not a great shoe but they could have made a few improvements to them I like the lacing system but the way its made with the shoe makes it difficult to tie them nice and tight The toe area seems to be a bit roomy which is nice for casual wear but when playing basketball it becomes a nuisance The patent leather is nice its just that since it is from the XIthe positioning of it with the XIII sole makes it crease very easily in the frontits already creasing after my first wear And the inner sleeve from the VIIis a nice addition to the 7 shoes 6 rings concept but the fact that the heel portion of the sleeve is so stiff and that it is sewn down to the heel of the overall shoe causes chafing and a difficulty in adjusting it Great color great design an overall great shoe

these are the most comfortable shoes yet i love my 

i ordered my 6 rings today and i cant wait for them to git in i think thay are the best shoe yet

These shoes are very comfortable form fitting to my feet and stylish Shoes are too new to speak on durability

These shoes have me reminiscing on back in the day

always happy with air max 95s and the color goes with most of my clothes

Yes I said it Max 95s are a must have for any sneaker enthusiast WhyBecause they are so iconic of a time in the mid 90s when Nike brought the heat through many break through designs that are popular to this day The split toe contrasting colors and air bubble laden soul are just a few of the shoe more noticeable features The Neons are a personal favorite but I have had several pairs over the years and I will keep buying these until Nike runs out

Not comfortable to run in The shoe makes you like 1 1 2 taller but when you are running it makes for a clunky experience and your feet are not used to accomodating for the thickness of the sole

My grandson loves them Very comfortable and great look

I Love Air max95 sneakers I need to find the green one I can wear them all day everyday

this shoe is so COMFORTABLE and they look as good as the picture i totally recommend these for hype guys

Bought size 15 for my son He loved it but I had to return it because it fits a bit too narrow This seems to be the case with big sizes The length is ok but the width too narrow I think all the big size sneakers should be a bit roomier in the big sizes One can not keep going upsize because width may fit but it may be too long

Very impressed with the product The shoes where a perfect fit Finishline had the product delivered in a timely manner I am definitely doing business with again

Remind me of basketball shoes a character I have created wears

I love the fit and style They are perfect for the spring

Collecting all the Jordans Such great styles I need them all

My first time buying a pair of Jordan and I can say I see why everyone rushes to get them They were comfortable and the material was better than expected I got them in black and they practically go with everything even though there is some red in the detailing

This was the 1st jordan i was interested in that sparked my love for the brand Love the feel the styling Fits well Comfort is good Classic timeless design Good for gym or casual I recommend to all that wanna try jordans

These are probably the the nicest pair of Jordan I own It took me a while to get them but as soon as they restocked with Finish Line I had to place an order immediately They are true to size Definitely worth it

Great shoes to have in your collection the only con for me was sizing for some odd reason I always have to go a 5 size down on Jordan 6s

The black and infrared are by far the best color scheme of the 6Glad I was able to scoop these up

Good deal I would recommend this for any one looking for a comfortable shoe that looks great

Finish line is my go to spot for the coolest new shows

great sneakers look good with everything i would recommend all the colorways

Copped the OG black infrared on a restock Best looking 6but hard to find Missed them when they first dropped Glad finish line had them They deliver when nobody else does Great fit and the best looking 6 

I have always loved the Jordan 6 Black Infrareds since I saw MJ dominate in them in the 91 playoffs and NBA Finals They had all the unique design cues translucent soles heel pull tab lace locks and stretch lace pouch and tech applications neoprene fit sleeve forefoot flex grooves encapsulated Air sole unit in the forefoot visible Air in the heel and molded ankle collar only Tinker could come up with and still remain one of my all time favorite Air Jordan models

Great shoe especially with the history that is behind it if you like Jordans I was able to get my hands on a pair before they sold out A truly iconic shoe that I am glad I own

Classic style for Jordan Shoe is comfy fit is good True to size Bought for fashion

Stylish shoe

MJ and Tinker Hatfield Need more to convince you to get one of theseHow about this being the shoe MJ won his first NBA ch and Ionship beating the bad boy Pistons and showtime Lakers Pretty historic shoe so get a pair NOW

Great Shoe Love the color way Made of great material Classic sneaker for the collection

They always fit great comfortable all day great styles and colors I will keep buying as long as they keep making them

I like the air Jordan shoes very much and when I saw the air Jordan6 I fell in love with it

Was a gift for my 14 year son and he loves them

I love how the colors on the outside of the shoe change color I am not a big an of the Jordan 6s Those Gatorade 6s both the white one in December and the Green Suede 6s releasing next year they hot I like the 5s 7s 8s 12s and 13s If this shoe is not sold out and is still available in size 8 I would go to a local Foot Locker Foot Action or Ch and s and ask the associate that if I purchase them would he play me one on one in them

I am no sneaker head but when sneaker heads see you in these sneaker they will give you props They are eye catching

I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend He loves them

I needed a green to go with my Eagles apparel and these shoes did it

Best Shoe ever First Shoe MJ wore when he got his first title and I felt like it was 1991 again Very happy with the purchase

I got a good deal on this classic style My son needed a basic black shoe and these were perfect can not go wrong with this class Jordan Looks nice on and my son said they are pretty comfortable He wears them for basketball practice

One of the best Jordan rn besides 11s you can wear anything and they can be basketball shoes also

I bought this shoe on sale and I could not be happier with my purchase Amazing

One of my best sneakers in my collection but go true to size this shoes goes for a very big size

I really like this shoe but in certain color ways

I love the jordan 6 love the shape and love the colors its different from regular colored jordans I really recommend this shoe

Lacing and tying the shoes is difficult and confusing Love the idea but in practice it really does not work

They look better to me in hand than on pictures They went on sale one weekend and I tag team that with a promo code after tax almost a hundred off original price this was a no brainer If they go that low again may double up and take the finish off the 2nd pair

Love the color of this shoes very stylish and comfortable One of my favorite Jordan 

There where cheaper than anyone elseprices came quickly and my son loves them repeat customer

One of my favorite shoes in my Jordancollection I have the whole shines collection thanks

Iconic these are the 1st ch and Ionship pair then you get to the colorway the flip flop they just keep changing it is like a new shoe every step you take and the quality is absolutely impeccable I am no leather expert but these are buttery soft I love them and to top it off got them on super sale finish line keep doing what you doing and I am keep grabbing them

I am not a huge fan of JordanHowever I purchased these because I liked the color and it was my birthday I have flat feet and they dug into the back of my heel They were comfortable for the most part and did not cause any blisters on anything So I purchased an instep and placed it into my shoes and that made it so much better

Love this shoe and color way was not hard for the choice being 6s are in my top 3 of Jordan retros The sale price definitely made it worth the buy Highly recommended

Excellent fit Jordans are more expensive but the fit of the shoe does not compare to any that I have I am all woman but I love every now and again to dress down and matching them up correctly look so girly I wish I had other colors

Retro Jordan 6 All Star iridescent or chameleon colorway is one I was looking forward to buying Took 2 weeks to arrive which I am okay with since I was not in a hurry to wear them But when they arrived the shoes were worn you can tell on the insole and the soles that people had walked around in these shoes for more than just fitting They were probably returned to the store from some customer and then shipped to me also the shoe inserts were missing in both shoes and the box was badly beat up

My husband loves his shoes It was exactly a true fit He said it is one of the most comfortable shoes He recommends I get a pair for myself and our 3 sons

The White Grey Gym Red Alternate of the Jordan VI are extremely comfortable and stylish I was sold on this shoes after looking at the perforations in the leather That detail gave the shoe more style over the original without departing completely from it A good add to a collection

These shoes wear a gift for a teenager who loves athletic wear Purchasing them the day they came out was cool too A happy moment Shoes were not worn immediately because weather was not that great They were worn eventually and got dirty Luckily an eraser helped to remove mark somewhat My advice is to be careful when you wear them because they cost too much money to get dirty so easily Purchase at your own risk

Hot kicksNikeAirJordanOneLove can not wait for Gatorade Edition Air Jordan 6

I wanted these sneakers but did not get a chance to get them when they dropped so I waited and the price dropped I had to buy them I love Retro 6 silhouette and the colorway was new They fit true to size

Good feets love Jordans Bought them for a friend

I was very excited when the sneakers finally arrived until I opened the box and noticed that one of the sneakers were damaged When I tried to exchange them they no longer had my size available do not think I will be purchasing sneakers online anytime soon

I bought the alternate 6s on release day and am a big fan of them they do get dirty easy tho

I got these because I loved the style and also because they were the closest that I would get to the retro 6 Carmines I love the way those looked but I was not able to get those so I got these and I love them

Got pair for me and my son both like color scheme planning on buying black ones next

Shoe is great do not like that I bought them the minute they drop then they go on sale a few weeks later Not cool

Great fit and super comfortable I definitely want to try to size down half a size because they felt big Otherwise they look amazing and I am happy I copped

I bought those shoes for my two kids and they are so happy

My opiniondope color scheme The 6are one of Jordandopest line of shoes I just wish they were as comfortable as the 126feel as though your walking on simple flat shoes I always have extra insoles in all my 6 

First I love this shoe From the iridescent look that includes the clear out sole a nice touch that I have never seen on a shoe before Fit wise it is a little wide creating some dead space but can be adjusted with a thicker insole or going down half a size if you like a tighter fit With these coming on sale they are a great buy for the collection

Uncomfortable and not worth what they are asking you to pay there are other Jordans that are way better buys

I love these sneakers Glad I added them to my sneaker collection

I am a true collector with many pairs of Jordan4are my favorite but 2017 is truly a year of the best retros ever to drop From PL to Vegas I am still rocking Jordanwith a fresh Lo waaaaaaan

Bought them as a gift and he really likes them No complaints here

Great shoe Even better price Love the colorway Fit true to size and recommend these to anyone who is unsure about getting a pair

I am retro fan so it can be unfortunate picking up some of these releases and have surprise restocks or price drops on sitting items like I experienced purchasing the all star pair The shoes are great looking but the market is not the same it seems

Comfortable and stylish I can wear them all day I just bought another color in this style

These Jordans are so underrated I can not believe people slept on them me personally I love them they cost 225 but they are totally worth it I mean what is 30 extra dollars cuz most Jordan releases are 190 and a lot of people stop them from getting these but me personally I love them I give it a few years but people will regret not getting these that is just my opinion but like I said I love them and would recommend

NICE SLICK STYLE OF SHOE CLEAN NO VISIBLE DAMAGE OR GLUE STAINS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

Bought these for my son and he loved it These are one of his favorites

I love mostly all black Jso this pair was a no brainer People do not like the holes but it is different and makes them more breathable Like someone else said they do run a little big so I would go a half size down

One of my favorite shoes ever make sure to buy a half size down because they run big

Love them just what I was looking for Now that I am older I can buy what I want

Jordans are being made of extremely cheap quality these daysnot only that most are awkwardly uncomfortable too Finish Line continues to send out poorly constructed shoes with glue marks all over them It may not be their fault but it is a poor reflection on the care for what they sell to customers I purchased multiple pairsto finally find an OK pair to keep This has happened many times other pairs i in store the Blackcat 13s etc

I bought these for my hubby He loves 6Especially because you do not have to tie them their durable all while being a stylish everyday shoe They look better on feet and the shoe strings actually reflect

Very comfortable shoe One of the first pair of Jordans than I have a ever brought I have been wearing Jordan everysince that day

Very comfortable shoe that I could wear everyday if I wanted to and a very sleek look with the new retro design that cleans up almost any outfit

I am a big Jordan 6 geek and could not pass these up I love the perforated black leather upper nice change up from the other black retro releases They fit true to size and are comfy right out of the box no break in needed Bummed that they do not have icy soles but that is just being nit picky

bought the shoe for my son and he loves them he wears a size 11 he plays ball with them

i always buy jordans and I continue to after getting these

There were a couple noticeable spots that were not the best quality The thread was coming apart and the leather had some bubbles The thread also looked like it was coming off of the sneaker itself Otherwise they were in pretty good condition

The quality is hit and miss some ppl have sneakers in good condition but mine came with a major flaw on the outsole it is like a big crack through the see through rubber towards the front of the shoe and the paint is uneven in areas also you should have better quality control at the factory if you are gonna charge 220 for an old ah sneakermaroon6s

One of the best retro releases in 2015 Love the Nike air on the back

I paid for two items from finish line and never received them Finish took and kept my money but i still do not have the items I highly recommend you do not purchase anything from them

This color way is plain to some but to me it is flat out fire Nice off white with just enough maroon to give it a touch of class

Great shoes Ovarall happy with my purchase other than delayed delivery schedule but was worth it

Very comfortable Cool shoes I am size 8 5 with wide feet it fits me well and very comfortable Wearing these takes me back to my middle school days man those were the fun days 1991 was so much fun We live in different times now But these shoes takes me back in time and makes me laugh I do not watch sport no more but these shoes have history Jordan 6 is my favorite and it is just cool to have

These are a great deal and they are classics why wouldnt you buy them but they look great and they had to be added to my collection

The bottom soles feel like there a bump on them feel like every time I walk it feel uncomfortable

Superb quality and comfort Jordan outdid themselves this time I have to admit 220 is pretty steep for retail but it was worth it First retro of the Maroonsince the OG in 1991 Comes with the OG Nike Air hangtag as well adding that nostalgic classic look Not an everyday shoe something you wear on a special occasion Overall I would say 220 is a force but well worth it for possibly the best retro in years

Awesome kicks great add on to my Jordan collection Very happy with my purchase

I love them that is why I bought them Get you some 4 real

These are an instant classic The material is good and perfect fit I had to buy two pairs

Classic comfortable fit Love them Speedy delivery around the holidays Was just happy FL had them in stock No one else did on my day of purchase

Must haves Def top 3 sneaker releases of 2015 Super comfortable the ladies love them the cream and maroon go together so flawlessly Overall dope product

Really good shoe and good looking shoe and good material

These are a great purchase The details are very precise and the leather is great quality It wears very comfortably and feels durable

Awesome Shoe looks great with outfits and very comfortable

Knew these were coming out so I avoided those ugly low 6s lol Nice leather on these and maroon color looks elegant with the off white

They are retro JCome on man Who does not want them

Comfortable Definitely not disappointed Great buy

The 6are one of my faves if not my favorite style of Jays so the Maroon was a must It looks better in person on you than in the pics Highly recommend

One of my favorite colorways for the Jordan VI Retro Beautifully crafted with quality materials Very happy with my purchase Nike Air looks so much better on the back of the shoe vs the Jumpman

Nice fit I love the clean white with the maroon Looks good on the foot Not big or bulky Glad Finish Line has my size

The materials feel pretty good I love the maroon color for these shoes Translucent outsole compliments well

I like the style the comfort true to size great all around no complaints

Always like copping from finishline cause they make it easy and seem to pretty much have sizes available most of the time Definitely will not be the last time buying from them Shoes came in a timely manner with zero flaws

These are hottest pair of 6that came out in awhile Finally something different

They are what I thought they were OG 6good fit super clean Cop them

Overall decent job by Nike and I Iike I was able to use my winner circle points plus free shipping However the left shoe was delivered with a scuff Markdisappointing

I love my JI will be ordering more THANKS FINISHLINE

Excellent shoe love everything about it The only thing the bothers me is the fit it is kind of big I also have the infrared 6s and they fit me kind of big I usually wear a 11 but I feel like I should have down 5 a size Unless you have wide feet I would recommend going down Other than that I love the shoe

good product easy to order fast shipping will surely buy again and refer to others

Another addition to my collection Love the NIKE AIR logo on the back

They are JNuff said can not go wrong with 6 

Quality material with adequate ankle support Comfortable enough for everyday wear

I was reluctant to buy them because they were pretty much all white But after a day of wearing them and they did not get dirty or beat up These was definately worth the buy

i bout these shoes for my husband he is a jordan fan and own like 20 pair of jordan 

The only negative was the price tag on these Jordan brand needs to release good quality shoes at a reasonable price like they did back in the good old days

Great sneaker Very clean looking colorway Good material also

Very nice shoe hard to keep the clear bottom up but the retro 6 is one of my favorites Shipped very fast

A must addition to my collection They are very simple and nice Keeping it simple and fresh

FitFor me i have usually worn an 11 in Jordanbut I gave my true size an 10 5 a try and it was the best move I have made perfect fit If its your first 6 I suggest to try them on if you can I went down a half size and love the fit if you have bigger feet stay with your regular size do not size up they will be long

I received exactly what the picture showed I like the jordan 6 It also was a good color combo

I like the little hints of maroon on these 6s And I like how it is more of an off white rather than pure white I look mostly for comfortable leather shoes and these are great I had a lot of Jordanwhen I was a little younger too and never took care of them Huge mistake I am going to take care of these forsure

The Shoe Fits A Little Big But iLove The Shoe Thank You For The Delivery

decent pair of jordans nothing special and definitely not worth the cost

This is my first pair 6from the Jordan brand that I actually wore I was really please with the fit and color I went down a half size and they fit great I never really liked the 6s because they tend to lean inwards with the way my foot is made but these have since gave me a different approach I am going to wear them out as much as I can because of the color If you rock sneakers then you know where I am coming from Overall a great pickup for me

Best kicks I have had in a few years I would recommend trying them Buy them

The Jordan brand is a quality shoe Not only are they stylish but they are constructed well Although this sneaker was pricey it is design makes it well worth it

These shoes are so cute My boyfriend got them for me for Christmas and I love them so much You know that the retro six Jordan is a classic silhouette so it is very flattering to most people and the color way makes a statement without being extra As soon as he told me I was getting them I immediately went to thinking of the cornucopia of ways they could be styled If you have not bought them yet What Are You Waiting For

My alma mater is maroon and white cream so I had to get these They are slightly stuff but I am sure they will loosen up over time Looks really good in person and very stylish

Great shoes and color Love the wear overall just over the shoes

Shoes are dope especially with the og nike air on the shoes

This has to be the best pair of JordanI own Very comfortable and beautiful look

Still have not put them on but great look and quality

Even though retail is 30 higher for the nike air basically these sneakers are dope and we will worth it it is not pure white a little creamy

Girlfriend got them for me for Christmas love the style and fit Favorite shoes yet by Jordan

We tend to get caught up in materialistic things far too much it is just another overpriced sneaker these prices are really ridiculous I am going to wear these a few times then they will go in my sneaker graveyardu203c xef xb8 x8fu203c xef xb8 x8fu203c xef xb8 x8f They are More important things in life then sneakersu203c xef xb8 x8fu203c xef xb8 x8fu203c xef xb8 x8f

I love these shoes Very iconic piece of sneaker history Much needed pair for the collection Hope every pair sits like these did just like the old days

Nice shoe but the price could come down Clean lines crisp color good leather look If nike can make it so the soles will not yellow or yellow as fast that would be a big deal

Bought them the day they came out took a little less than a week to arrive with free shipping Quality is immaculate If you did not cop you definitely missed out

Not happy about purchase had to return and it was a Christmas gift please make sure you are more accurate with shoe size

My older brother asked for them and just a great suprise for christmas gift Took a while to get here but overall great pair of shoes

Love the colors shoe is made with great quality as well

The maroon 6s are one of my favorite kicks the shoes are very comfortable

Best buy of the year my opinion and I purchased online aft the release at 1 30 pm could not believe there were still available in my size

This product ia great I can wear these to a formal done error church then also stunt at the mall with my fr I ends in these they are completely fire They are a sleek and beautiful shoe imo they should of been a must cop for all serious and OG collectors

Love my 6They are the best in my eyes I have others but these surpass all the rest

The shoe looks good on feet and is pretty comfortable

These joints are official I would buy them again

I like that these shoes are off white so I can wear them this warm winter instead of waiting until Spring

I loved the style of this shoe and color The jordan 6are a great catch to have They are true to size and very comfortable

i love these shoes when I walked in school every body was staring at them they loved them I love these shoes the color everything

The most uncomfortable aspect of this retro is the 220 price minus a 20 rewards certificate Still a dope comfortable shoe A suggestion for Finish Line if I spend over 200 it should come with free shipping retro or not I bought the maroons in 1991 for 80 at a Nike Outlet The 1991s had a clear lace lock housing that a lot of Js come with example Yeezy Son of Mars purchased for 129 Its weird I pay 140 more 20 yrs later and get less Minus 2 stars for price

I was very satisfied with this shoe Everyone was soooo jealous when I walked into the school You have to get forcefields for these 10 10

Awesome Gorgeous Excellent Beautiful Adorable

Love this shoe just wish that it was GYM Red instead but i steal rock it with anything Thanks Finish Line

Very comfortable Jordans and fit to size Shoes were delivered extremely fast as well

A classic sneaker The Quality of shoe is great I wish the infared was more redish because it looks more like pink

Hot shoe and will always be a classic A must have for any sneakerhead or collector

Thumbs up in all reguards except I was surprised the infrared color was as bright as it was For males its better to stay away form any color that can be mistaken for pink The new generation will probably love it though Im a 80baby

Nice to have real infrared again for the first time since 1991 These are sure to pop for a black shoe As usual with Jordan the price is ridiculous and the quality is not perfect every time

This is the shoe I have been waited for years and years Awesome shoe I am so happy to get them from finishline Thank you finishline

I RECIEVED MY SHIPMENT PROMPTLY FROM FINISHLINE WHEN I TOOK A LOOK AT THE SHOES THEY WERE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION THE QUALITY OF THIS JORDAN 6 IS AMAZING IT REMINDS ME OF THE ORIGINAL JRODAN 6 ITS A WONDERFUL SHOE

Hello

I had the OGback in the day and had to make sure I copped the new releases when they came out Great fit and nice feel even on my flat feet

Would prefer original color way of gym red

Jordan Brand definitely is not using the same quality materials as they used to

Not bad for a Jordan These materials are starting to worry me for the price I do not have any of the original pairs so I do not know what to compare them to but they feel a little cheap at times Overall this is a good looking shoe and I love the colors

Compliments Already Like the retro had these babies when the originals came out Smooth and Comfort fitting Like music to the eyes

I love the 6and these look great quality left something to be desired but overall good retro jordan

Great looking shoe the only flaw I can find is the quality of the leather which is a known factor amongst sneaker collectors nowadaysspecially old heads like me who got used to the butter soft leather of the 90s early 2000s and the fact that for some reason the 6s seem to run a little bigger than usual Almost a half size bigger which is no big deal if you add an insole but other than that probably one of the cleanest color way of the 6s model besides the black infrared

Looks good and feels true Been waiting for these Sport Blue 6since first word of release Thanks for my purchase

Havent even worn them yet Probably wont for a least a couple more months or so I do not know though They are just like all the other 6as far as comfort goes

Love the retros this year this one is one of the best of the year

Nice clean look and got them quickly

Love the Jordan 6 released in this colorway it is basic but stands out Very clean sneaker

Love these They run big so i suggest going down half a size

Shoes are okay quality is decent but i am highly disappointed in the pink looking infrared

These shoes are perff lol but the only con is that they scuff easily But other than that its great The size is true to size so you should not buy a size up or down

A classic shoe from Jordan brand which celebratethe big win in a Cigar theme Quality is amazing and materials are second to none The Jordan 6 in this iconic color way is one that all shoe enthusiasts can appreciate

The shoe could have better materials for the price cost and more cushion

thank you finishline

They are great how could they not beAnother iconic are release

this is a Bad boy shoes Fits well and very comfortable Nice to play on or just for stroll You should get one at Finishline if they restock

These are a head turner Everyone says they look fly on

Otherwise it is great to have this colorway again

The shoe will break necks while walking down the street The quality of this retro is also remarkable Have over 100 shoes and this is one of the best retros The materials are nice as well ig andre9283

The red on the shoes is not the same as the original but that is ok with me The ice sole is very nice

def the most anticipated shoe for me this year such a classic and great memories

Product is exaclty what it should be A throwback that has come back to life

These shoes are VERY comfortable and Stylish I bought these for my 13yr old son and he TURN heads everywhere he goes with these shoes on

I heard a lot about lack of quality on this model and mine are in great shape No complaints I do find that the retro 6run a little large compared to other retros went a half size down and they fit great

Loved the og carminebut sadly this retro did not live up to the quality expected from a pair of Jordansince the price goes up and the quality goes down Sad to see this type of product come out under the Jordan brand which should be a premium product of higher quality

I like this shose This is Best color way AJ6

Received the Carmine Box and shoes in perfect condition Fits perfect to size Slapped on shoe protector before heading out to town

Another great part of my collection as these shoes was worn by MJ

The 2014 Carmineare a great shoe they look nice are very comfortable Other than the high price on retroand the alright quality these are very good shoes

I get complements everywhere I go when I have these retroon

great shoes one of the best 6out there

nice shoe love them looks great with a pair of levi 501

Great shoe but obviously made very cheap Love my Jaytho

Great colorway retro

The retro 6 are really comfortable the quality is not bad pretty cheap and is a classic colorway Only problem for me is that they run pretty big it is a must have classing retro

The feelRoomy yet snug fit Wide sole gives sure footed feel on the courtshould not expect to roll my ankle in these

very comfortable shoes and very nice looking shoes a must have shoe

Fits true to size Wear it with some Jordan or Nike Dri fit socks One flaw is that the shoe creased pretty bad by the ankle area when putting it on but other than that the shoe is nice These shoes goes with practically any outfit for casual wear or playing on the court

This is almost like when I bought these back with the pack exceot some glue stains

Shoes look better in person and are a definite attention grabber

So glad Jordan Brand decided to bring this shoe back to life It is a beautiful shoe that has a white upper with accents of red a black white blue clear midsole with the red lace lock tying everything together Jordan himself wore a pair of these in the NBA playoffs during a ch and Ionship winning game The shoe is super comfortable and sturdy if you still wanted to play basketball in them Great overall look feel and breathability Highly recommend these Carmine 6if you are a collector or if you are on the top of fashion Even though the Carmines were first produced over 20 years ago

They really did great with the infrared on this shoe It is true to og form Jordan VIare one of my personal favorites from my childhood and glad to see these comeback in this color way

This is a classic retro color that was sold out everywhere after release day weekend Thanks to a Finish line restock mine arrived to great satisfaction this is a well made comfortable shoe The Infrared has that pop goes the weasel to light up the streets on a sunny day these go great with Jeans Khakis and Grey Sweats

Excellent product from JB however came rather creased Not bad but still They need to use that bubble rap

High quality shoes OG Color way Need I say more

I am not a sneaker head per se but when I saw the Retro 6 was coming out in the true infrared I had to have a pair The shoe is of high quality with good stitching The fit is perfect The infrared is spot on and very bright I buy shoes to wear them and these are no exception so 160 is a little much to spend on a pair of sneaks If you are a Jordan collector or are like me and like to wear them these are fantastic shoes

the size does not fit well it is a little bit bigger than regular the workmanship is under the average

Quality seems to be pretty nice Look good with a pair of jeans The Infrared almost looks pink but that probably has a lot to do with all the white Nice icy soles

i love the jordan 6s but they crease to easy i put them on and they creased as soon as i put them on i ordered a 13 and they feel like 14s and my biggest problem with the shoe is that its not infrared its basically pink if you look older pairs of the infrareds you notice they are red but the new 2014 pair are pink

Look good and fit well I normally wear 11but noticed from a previous pair that these fit a little big so I got some 10 5and they fit perfect

I missed out on this OG color way when the infrared pack was released But I got my chance to obtain them this time around Everything about this shoe is clean and elegant and I can not wait to own the black infrared that drops later on in the year

By far one of the best pair of Jordanmade I love everything about this shoe From the design to it performance

This is one of the most iconic Jordans ever produced It is instantly recognizable and very well made It does run a little narrow for me however I have pretty wide flat feet so for most people they are probably fine The quality and design perfection have and will stand the test of time shoes are still made from this template and the visible Air is striking Visually all of my favorite Jordans are between the 3 thru 11 and it is a pretty tough tie between the 5 and 6 for style I hope they make plenty more this year of this legend

Comfortability is good and the infrared color is on point just like the air max 90 infrareds

Classic must have Jordan Retro Great fit and performance

i really this shoe but the infrared was to pinkish very comfortable and light weight

Great shoe great fit

Great look and fit I would definitely recommend the Retro 6 Glad i purchased

Overall a quality shoe but I was hoping to get the other color way

My all time favorite shoe is the 6Just look at them who would not want to have a pair And I actually mean a pair I had to buy me two pairs I mite just have to stash them away for the future

Nothing like Jordan Retros when you can get them They fit perfectly and have purchased several pair from Finishline Will purchase again and again

Love these shoes An all time classic Only gripe I have is finishline advertised free shipping but it still charged me

do not waste your money on these the color is so off its not red its pink

Great shoe one of the top 5 all time in my opinion Great for playing hoops in Very comfortable and stylish Will look great with jeans or shorts Only negative is the price should be offered at original release price I am not a big fan of the all red colorway but great shoe

The Nike Air Jordan 6 white infrared is a nice looking shoe I would say it is more comfortable than the 3 but not as comfortable as the 11 I oddly decided to wear this shoe out in the rain It is not really rainproof and you will slip more easily because of the design of the soles

Everything was good except for the fit the shoes ran a bit large but it is easily fixed

The Infrared23 color is crazy Best quality leather ive seen on a Jordan in a while My only complaint would be that on the toebox of my left shoe the leather was almost not tumbled at all while the right shoe was perfect

the inferred 6 from 2014 was suppose to be the inferred color that dropped years ago but over all its a nice sneaker the leather on the shoe is better than the 2010 ones the icey blue tint to the sole makes the sneaker look cleaner 5 star shoe all around

toebox creased and i only worn it twice

love them i had them when i was in high school

These shoe were a great fit and looked perfect

The OG was just red that Jordan wore not infrared as it is on the shoe today Name may be the same but different color Still an amazing shoe I just pray to get the Jordan 6 black infrared Favorite shoe of all time Black FridayLol

The red on these is really nice its true infrared Quality leather and better than previous Jordan 6 releases

Even though most people hated on the color scheme of this release the infared color way is different and makes it pop on the white shoe For someone who wears a lot of lighter colors this shoe works out very well with my outfits The shoe is quality made but not as up to par as previous Jordan models in the past I do like the icy sole and fits true to size People slept on this shoe but will regret it later

Love the new waiting in line where you have to wait your turn to access the site Any other time they are sold out by the time you can add them to your cart

Very simple yet elegant One of the coolest part of my AJ collection

This shoe is so fresh that it can be featured in a Febreze commercial Its so Clean that Billy Mays could not describe it better BUT WAIT THEIRS MORE Its so ICY that even Buddy Valastro cant make it better Overall its a great shoe and I have not worn them

A prized Jordan retro in the Infrared colorway Vibrant Infrared makes the shoes Retro 6 usually run half size big The smooth white leather on retros are improving but could still be better Though made in good quantities sneakerheads know to keep an extra pair on ice because you never know how many years before they are released again

These are probably one of my favorite Jordans in my personal collection The color way is very fresh and the entire sneaker is quality Highly recommend these watch out for price gaugers though

Really love this shoe this is my first time being own a pair of Air Jordan 6in the OG white infrared colorway and they did not disappoint

THE SHOE I PURCHASED WAS WORTH THE MONEY there is ALWAYS A FEW SLIGHT THINGS YOU MIGHT SEE THAT YOU do not LIKE ABOUT A CERTAIN PAIR OF SHOES BUT OVERALL MY DAUGHTERFATHER WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED THANKS FINISHLINE

Great color scheme wonderful classic

The retro 6 white infrared was originally released 1990 by itself and was the first colorway to release Jordan brand did a good job keeping it as OG as possible with the true infrared On foot very comfortable a little on the heavy side The eye catcher is the clear icy blue bottom infrared Jump man on bottom white mid sole with infrared around the air pocket on both sides All white leather upper elastic on tongue for true fit Upper tongue is black with Air Jordan insignia the pull tab on heel is black with infrared Jump man and Air stitched in white on heel Infrared lace lock to compliment white shoe laces Overall great shoe and a must have for any collection

THIS SHOES ARE AMAZING THE PRICE THE QUALITY AND EVERYTHING THIS SHOE HAS IS TOP OF THE LINE

This retro 6 ran a half full size bigger That may have been due to the minimal amount of padding in this retro Otherwise a classic retro

The Infrared 23 Air Jordan 6 Retro is a great new take on this classic iconic sneaker Taking the infamous accent color and flipping it to take over the entire upper was a great idea The shoe looks great in all red and the black accents and hits of icy blue translucent on the outsole really makes them pop Another great Air Jordan Retro and a must have

I was not sure if I was going to like these But to my surprise they turned out to be one of my favorite JIf you get a chance try and pick these up well worth it Solid

Just a great classic shoe from the good old days Great fit classic colors sure to grab some attention

As an avid Jordan Collector I was thrilled to see the OG colorway back it is a great shoe on or off the court

The quality and color is not what others may think once in hand and on feet the retro VI Infrared is going to be highly sought out pair for a while

Super nice quality JB has created a masterpiece here Thank you finishline You guys are truly the best

These shoes while having been retro ed somewhat recently have been on my list for a long time as i missed out last release I am truly glad I was able to get them and even happier with what came in the mail The quality on these is very good the midsole has a nice matte paint finish and the shoes while slightly roomy are super comfortable GET THEM while you can As a side note got the Infrared23 6too those things are out of this world

Aftern 5 days of wearing them the air unit popped and the sole fell apart I deserve a refund or the same pair of shoe

The Infrared Jordan 6 is known as the best 6 colorway out there and this tops it The lace lock resembles a Gatorade bottle there is the bolt on the inside of the shoe and the material is outstanding I have worn Infrared 6s and this Gatorade shoe just feels better Nothing but good things to say about this shoe

I just got my Jordan 6 Like Mikes Was honestly worried the color way was too much but I do not own a pair of 6s and wanted to give them a shot I was totally wrong The design is awesome and look amazing on I have several pairs of Jordan but I am not a collector I wear my Js But these look so good I almost hate to wear them out Definitely in my top two favorite pairs with my Jordan Retro 11 Space Jams

I really admire and I really enjoyed the true different styles and creativity of shoes that you guys make to Ensure the quality and uniqueness of the shoes did I love the accountability of the shoes

It is an amazing show I love the style and color

I love the product the fit is amazing The Jordan 6 retro shoe is just a great shoe to play basketball or if your going out on a date with your girlfriend Its my go to sneaker

I like the leather upper and design The shoes run a little big and wide With the amount of perforations the shoes does not feel it has good ventilations Felt warm wearing it for hours

These 6definitely are not subtle but that is what makes them great They provide a great amount of pop to any outfit and let you showcase some of the flair you want with a solid colorway OG White and Red is really in but I honestly think the black looks better in most circumstances All things considered this pair is solid for any rotation in either color

Very cool design retros as well as color and story behind them Air Jordan 6 Retro is one of my fave Jordan models if not he best They run a little wide so I always stay with my true size since I have wide foot

My boyfriend and I Got these shoes to match they are great quality and true to size

this shoe was built tough and its different than all the other retro sixes out there because of the material the type of leather they put on the shoe The material makes this shoe unique in its own way im kinda happy to see a new material on the sixed ive been waiting for the longest for this to happen Overall a pretty great and comfortable shoe

After all the Christmas spending at Nike I have done I decided to spend some money on myself I was worried about the quality on these being worse than the 2009 black and red ones but now I am convinced they stepped it up with the quality on this silhouette Very happy 5

This is a dope shoe I am reviewing the black cats and they are very comfortable This is my first pair of 6s but I own many other Jordans and besides my 4s these are the most comfortable Really durable and THEY DO NOT CREASE AT ALL The padding stops creasing They look amazing in person would definetly cop again

Great looking shoe You can not go wrong with the Jordan VI A must have if you are a true Jordan fan

Nike Jordan hasnt released this shoe in such a long time now that they have and I have a pair Im glad to say I was not disappointed at all The shoe runs fairly large so size down 5 or a full size Im true to size 9 5 and I grabbed a size 9 no problem with fit Would recommend shoe decreasers if you plan to wear them often

I can not wait to show off my shoes to my friends

Super great shoe looks awesome and are so comfy

Even though you have the 11s and the 6s coming out around the same week the 6s are a most have for most sneaker heads

great shoe I think air Jordan 5 and 6 and 7 is definitely half or full size down depend on how wide and narrow your fit is Love the shoe but had to return 2 sizes cuz they were way too big my size is 10 and 9 fits perfect

The quality and looks of these shoes are so fresh and so clean They fit like a glove on your feet and are comfortable to walk in I like this shoe has the feature of the lace lock

I received my Jordan Retro 6 Maroonin size 12 today and was very disappointed with the craftsmanship on the soles There are several paint marks mainly on the clear portions of the sole and the Jordan logo

One of the best shoes this year Ready to get those 11s

The new maroons receive a remaster after 24 years with materials and exact details of the OG creating a time capsule of a replica down to the old school box

I am very happy that Nike finally brought back this iconic colorway I love the nubuck and reflective material of the AJ 6 I wish Nike used more nubuck in other colorways One of the best release this year

Classic sneakers with a great stand out colorway my favorites

had the og 6so me this was a must buy the icey sole on these retros perfecetion

had this shoe for about six months very comfortable and a great looking shoe only complaint is that only after wearing this shoe a handfull of times is that the clear part of the sole starts to turn yellow other than that the shoe is a great buy

Amazing shoe very comfortable and i like the air in the heel

i love nike shoe and i feel to wear it nike is very beautiful shoe that is why i want ship it and put it on

Jordan is one of my favorite brands I already have a pair of 2and 9Also some spizikes I can not wait to get a pair of 6my first pair will probably be these Jordan keep on making them sick shoes

First pair of kicks i purchased from nike com Very happy with my experience Would it again for sure

Good shoe love the way it looks The only problem I had was they run a little big So if you can try your actual size and a half a size smaller for maximal comfort I just put on a thicker sock and I am good These are some nice kicks

Nice this is cool a nice throwback This is my favorite show from the jordan collection

they look sweet and feel pretty good but defiantly arent made to hoop in first time i wore them in a summer league game my feet blistered and i had to switch to other shoes

I love the 6but the quality was horrible The paint seem as if a child was given this shoe to be painted I like jordan shoes but come on whats up with this horrible quality What happend to quality inspired by the greatest player of all time

Fantastic shoe Just got a pair of the oreos size 11 the size that I usually wear I probably should have gone with size 10 5 for a more snug fit but it is OK I am planning on buying a lot more pairs This shoe definitely is wide but for a guy with wide feet it feels like you are stepping on heaven Finally a shoe that does not smash my feet Dope shoes Nike Make them forever

i love these shoes i even got the oreo laces they are pretty comfortable

For me it is a holdover for the white red colorway coming out 06 12 A great shoe nevertheless

Great look and wear all around A little stiff would not recommend wearing for basketball play

i love these shoes there so good ive been wearing mine non stop for 6 months and they still look great these shoes are the best ive ever had by far

After waiting almost twenty years I finally have a pair of AJ6both color schemes Awesome Shoe

Theses shoes are great I waited on them for months and they were worth it They do run a little big I usually wear a 12 or 11 5 but I had to get an 11 in these

ALTHOUGH THE RED IS A VARSITY RED ADVERSE THE MANY FANS OF THE INFARED COLOR I AM SURPRISDED OF THE SHOES QUALITY TO ME ITS FAIRLY NICE ALTHOUGH I WONT BE BALLING OR ANYTHING SO I do not KNOW HOW DURABLE THEY ARE AND SINCE I GOT WORD THE REAL INFAREDS are DROPING LATER THIS YEAR I STILL AM HAPPY I COPPED THESE FRESH ICEY KICKS NICE JOB JB

I played some ball and they feel good I wear two pair of socks like I always do and still feel good I have to get a good feel what I can do Have to break in but good shoe Will buy again Im a Jordan guy

Ordered both these and the flu game retroBoth arrived very quickly and I am extremely happy with the quality they came in I wear lager sizes 15 16 usually and I am happy both were available in the right sizes The 6do run large I have got a bit of extra room in them compared to the 12but it is not that big a deal Will continue to order from nikestore in the future

Not quite like the infareds but good enough for me Only thing that would have been better would be the actual retro of the infareds

CANT WAIT TILL WE GET BETTER SURPRIZE MISSED THEM WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT BACK IN THE 90 

The Soles Will Yellow Fast

very nice and comfy although I shouldh have ordered a 12 instead of a 12 5

This was my first Jordan purchase in a long long time Very satisfied and one of the nicer jordans out even if you see everyone and there mother wearing it Ill keep these in the box for a little bit then take them out when the time is right

and WHO KNEW they would be so flippin comfy

i love this shoe i like to play soccer with that shoe

Yeah MJ wore these in his first ring But these are far from being a great shoe I wore the originals SIZE 11 Fit ok Ankle support avg Indoor traction is poor except on a perfectly clean floor do not wear them outside then Despite no air in front all day comfort Nubuck as it was called will not last long Even a big guy found them good for inside work WHY DO THEY COST 50 MORE NOW

These Go hard And I have yet too see Other people with them only draw back is the suede gets dirty easy

This retro is very welcome and I am glad that JB brought it back Although it is not in the infrared colorway the varsity red actually looks good The shoe is very comfortable and feels durable They do feel just slightly large but you can get your actual size If you are a Jordan collector I would highly suggest that you add these to your collection

Great product Easy to place an order Shipped on time with email updates on delivery progress

Jordan always makes a good shoe for the most parT Alot of people disagree with this cwcolorway } becuase of it being suede and not infrared Well sorry to those that missed out I personally like the buttery suede feel better than the durabuck and its a new cw Its a great shoe Ima casual wearer do not hoop in my Jso but they are comfortable and durable and one of the most stylish shoes out there no matter how many times its retroed or even if Jordan isnt no longer playing If your not up on the VI then you need to go and do your reasearch My sz is 11 5 but I sized down to 11 for these

wow all every one talks about is how great the quality is on there retro 6s but why didnt i receive that type of quality the sock liner is a bit jaked up and the mid sole was painted horribly with blotches of black all aorund it the icey sole looks like its about to fall off as a sneaker head im disipointed and they have yet to be worn

These shoes are classic Run alittle bit big but overall all good Nike always keep the Jordancoming

This is not quite the infrared I hoped for but still an awesome shoe This is by far my favorite Jordan and I only regret not getting two pairs back in the day do not pass on these classics

They Nice At first I was a lil down that they are not infared but really the varisity red is kind of clean Had the OGwhen i was in the first grade but some kind of way the sole came apart like a day after I got them and when we went to return them they were sold out I remember that sad night I cried Hey but do not get it twisted I was only 6 years old But overal I was impressed with the comfort and the quality of the suede I would definitely recommend this shoes and if you can get the Motorsports 6 that come out tomorrow cause I am My stomach is turn now cause they are sick Ugghhh Oh yea I wear a 11

What can I say about this classic shoe that has not already been said The black suede is just like the originals and the look of the shoe is timeless People may dog the shoe cuz it does not have infrared but varsity red gets the job done hands down I missed out getting the OGs back in the 90s so I had to get my hands on these this time around Either with jeans or wearing shorts these shoes are bound to turn heads out in public Sneakerheads and non sneakerheads know a classic when they see one

The material it is made from is not the same when it came out iwas look forward to this shoe since last year

MAN these right here are the freshest out right now its just like 9 0 again so fresh clean why would you not like them they might be better then the OG ones comfort wise the shoe is on point the suede is nice spray some protection on those for sure but yeah the shoe overall is nice good job nike

This shoe is an instant classic thought it would sell quick so bought online just be safe and i feel like a dummy now cuz alot of stores still got them overall shoes amazing only prob is the suede afraid it will ruin

The only other thing I noticed that is different is on my OGon the back it says NIKE Air and has the swoosh These retros have the Jordan logo and says AIR Also the retros are all suede the OGhad a combination of suede and leather I think I like the OG better because of that

There was a reason why these havent been are retroed in over 10 years Bar none a Classic Shoe with history behind it Only thing missing is the NIKE AIR with the swoosh stitched on the back of the shoe A mirror copy except the Nike Logo of the first retros from back in 99 2000

Definitely must return the OG Jordan VI with Nike Air logo and color Infrared Air jordan OG VI Carmine as well the Nike people should think about this due to the symbolic value that represents this icon Jordan shoes no matter that we have to pay a higher price for the license of the Nike Air logo so colleagues on this forum support me to suggest to people Nike they must manufacture again the jordan VI OG even so these are great retro VI The best ever jordan Made

Thank you Nike for finally are releasing the shoe I had always wanted but could never have

I got these 6the day they came out on the 23rd too clean keep these in the box till summer

i missed out on the space jams but this are so fresh i am a ten but i got an eleven cause they were all sold out but they still fit good

My fav classic I remember YBA ball with these I lil steep on price for me but knew I would regret it if I did not pick them up this time and I am glad I did Super comfy and stylie

I would give this shoe 5 stars but I gotta take off a star for the Infrared color But I wore these a few hours after I got them and they are comfortable and have good quality and feel like they will hold up over time Next time Jb releases these they need to bring back the NIKE AIR on the Back in bright red and that will set the shoe off and have sneakerheads going crazy

My first Air Jordan back in 91 Great Ball battles during the early 90 

Will I play ball in theseNo Will I wear them with prideYes Easily one of the most iconic Jordans of them all the VI is still my favorite This is not the Carmine VI but it will do for now

This is my second favorite Jordan is my favorite I actually missed out on these when i was a kid so I jumped at the chance this time So so fresh

Love the 6only problem with these is the red paint on the midsole Definently should buy these for yourself Cant wait for the other 6 Jrdan 6 releases this year

RUNS BIG BUT REALLY COMFY AND BUTTERY OVERALL GREAT SHOE FOR GOING OUT

So sick Just wish it was infered not varcity Oh well very nice stylish shoe

For me these are probably the best looking Jordans every made They embody so much history and packaged in a sophoisticated and elegant way

impressive although not infareds the material used is nice suede is real good detail and as well as sole features a rating i would give these stylish yet iconic shoes would be a 9 out of 10 respectively

All My Jordan Heads This A Must Have

this is one of the greatest shoes ever made in jordan history

i love the vi its my 2nd favorite i luv these so much i brought me 2 pair if i get more money i will order a 3rd pair

Little slim fitting But stylish and comfortable fitting Would recommend maybe ordering a 1 2 size up

Beautiful design Great price Good quality Nice selections Fits a little narrow but comfortable enough to wear for a long period of time

Honestly I love this shoe I got it for Christmas I love how easy it is to get it on and off But when we first tried it on my heel would easily slide up and down in the back We tried putting in a insole but it would still move

The shoe looks great But the plastic loop at the heal flips up and digs into the heel I just got these and now I have blood all over my shoe I do not know if I got a faulty pair Disappointed because I love the look Hoping they will switch these out for a pair and this issue does not continue

I had to have these love the colorway of black gold and white 1Happy Birthday to Me

Love the classic look of the Jordan 1 Mid I bought a pair Jordans rookie season I must say that the 2019 shoe feels MUCH BETTER than they did in the 80I Love the color way and the fact that they still come with 2 different color shoe laces They kept it old school Luvit

I was never a huge Retro 1fan but these are great shoes Very comfortable for my wide feet They are a great winter shoe And the price If you can get them please do yourself a favor and add these to the collection

Great addition to my shoe collection Get them while you can at this price

I was always a fan of Jordans I loved these shoes If you do buy these shoes always remember that it takes some time to break in the shoe after that fantastic shoe

Honestly my favorite pair of shoes When I tried them of in store they were true to size but they were meant for wide feet I felt like Overall an amazing shoe but has minor flaws to it but what can you expect They are Retro 1s

Basing this on the Black Red retros that I am wearing now I bought these because they look GREAT I do suggest that anyone who buys Jordans of all shoesshould definitely try them on before buying So I bought these and the black red pair Yes the material on this pair is more sturdy YES these shoes should be able to cater to WIDE feet Very nice classy look I HOPE I do not get stains on the back of my socks Black Red retros have a red st and labeled 30 where your heel is it rubs off

Started to collect Jordan 1about a year and half ago because I have always thought they have a timeless and clean look to them even when heavily worn Plus they have the most colorways and variations of any of his retros I really really love this shoe A premium shoe at a non premium price That wool on there is crazy and its an excellent cold weather kick Even though its a mid it is still one of my favorite Jordan 1s

I purchased this shoe because of the premium materials The black wool is really sharp It does not crease and keeps my foot warm in the colder months The leather is soft and since it is a Jordan 1 body the look is appealing Of my Jordan 1 collection this is my favorite

This classic is a perfect mix of the Jordan Game Royal 1s with a perfect pop and accents of red I fell in love with this shoe when I first saw it at the mall and decided to hop online as soon as possible to pick up my size since these were sold out at most stores in Salt Lake City The Air Jordan 1 is a shoe that will garner attention anywhere you goI feel great about pulling the trigger on this pickup

The shoes look great but I was not aware that one pair was nubuck and not leather all around The pictures on the website make it difficult for me to tell the difference

I cannot understand those people who hate Jordan 1 mid Its very nice quality shoe with reasonable price

Bought the red black white ones but they honestly look orange Its like a mixture of orange and red and pink and it was not the color I expected In the picture for the red ones it looks red but really it looks pinkish orange I still like the design but it does crease alot

I received the Tuxedo mids I like to call them my Stormtrooper JordanGiving them four stars due to the white leather being a bit stiff Still a nice colorway The fit is like all the other mids I own which is a half size larger than the OG 

Been waiting for a while for the triple blacks to come back out favorite of all time durable comfortable once broken in and goes well with anything bc of the silhouette

Great quality and comfortable Nike never disappoints

I rated this product 5 stars out of 5 because I was that satisfied with the product after I received it a few weeks ago I bought this product through nike com I am a young male customer who was looking for a pair of shoes to wear casually and to work out in

A classic air Jordan look with a different look I have heard they run a bit larger but I am a size 10 got a 10 and they fit perfect I wear them casual with jeans and on the go the gumshoe look is a nice unique look on these shoes white stitching looks very stylish as well

The Air Jordan 1 Mid has great RE2PECT for its stylish color and stitching Ive only worn them once and everyones already asking me where did I get them I had 5 people sign up for the Nike app becuase of the shoe I just met these people There comfortable and stylish You cant go wrong with the Jordan brand

Good quality Very creative combining 2 legends together

Super comfortable goes with almost anything and cleans fairly easy

i love all jordan shoes they are very good shoesvery durable

This is one of favorite pairs in the short amount of time if having them I normally get a few compliments on them every time i wear them These shoes turn heads Aside from the complimentsthe overall quality of this shoe is a re2pectful nod to the Yankees legacy Nice stitching and the material is very clean and pristine As with most Jordan 1sthey are comfortable and are true to your size They are easy to clean and do not get dirty quick like other Js You wont be disappointed get this unique version of J1

I just wanted to say as of everything you order online its going to come fresh from the nike factory it might be tight that just means they need to be adjusted once they are on my feet they are very comfortable I cant complain about the price either Im very happy with my purchase

I have returned mid cut AJ 1before because of the fit but this pair fits great and the material is better than the other midI assume this is because they are a special pair Nike got it right on these

The leather is really nice and soft feels a little rubberized Love the gum sole makes for a really durable outer sole Great subtle yankee details throughout the shoe Fits true to size Definitely happy with the pick up

Great looking shoe to add to my collection Maybe going to get another pair

Very impressed with the leather and attention to detail the gum sole add a special touch One of the nicest Air Jordan 1 special editions

Great shoes only down side is leather could have used better quality

Excellent quality and very comfortable Instant classic and great way to pay Re2pect to one of the GOATs Derek Jeter

Very nicely designed and comfortable shoe from the color combinations to quality of materials along with unique logos on shoe

Bought only to collect because of the Re2pect Jeter Jordan trio but I can see myself wearing them during the winter the look way better in person then online

The fit is pretty narrow so that creates a somewhat large extra tied area but its not a big deal The shoes are pretty comfortable if you are not walking a long distance Very stylish and the durability is solid It began to get scratches on the leather just after a few weeks and the upper cloth material began to rip a little Overall it serves its purpose

As a nostalgic consumer I can never go wrong with a pair of Jordan 1 tennis shoes Simple yet great shoe

Super good product and with good durability

I love this shoe fits nice It feels like Im not wearing shoes

My favorite shoe ever Classic style Durable and easier to clean and keep looking Good Compared to other shoes or even other 

These are a great retro look they feel great and go with almost all outfits

I bought for my son and he loves them he says they are comfortable and classic

Overall great shoe extremely comfortable stylish I would buy another pair and fits true to size

Love the way these shoes look even though I have only worn these shoes once they are very comfortable I do say they run a little big so if you are considering to buy a pair i would go a half size smaller if you are a 10 5 get a 10 Overall a great shoe

Shoes looked and felt cheap do not seem like the were a durable shoe

Looks great feels great and has great traction Even though its an everyday shoes I swear it has better traction than the SuperFly 4 You can tell by the way it squeaks so often

My husband wore these for a weekend of lots of walking in Vegas He loved the style and fit but killed his toe next to the pinkie He would def buy another pair but he is not gonna wear them if he has to walk a lot

I love the 1so much that I have decided to grab my 3rd pair this past week Love the classic look They go with almost any outfit you wear Very comfortable and durable Runs true to size Great sneaker overall

i bought these a couple months ago and now the midsole is starting to seperate from the shoe otherwise everything else is excellent

I love these Must have in all shoe collections They have creased in about 5 wears

Shoe speaks for itself they are sweet

I am huge fan of white Jordanand coming in the Air Jordan 1 silhouette as well as the wolf grey accents this is a must have sneaker

Love the all white Great for casual wear as well as athletic purposes

These kicks are overall dope If you do not mind having to get rid of the creases on the toebox with a wet towel and iron every so often get these shoes the all white looks crispy with almost any outfit just keep them clean

Great looking shoe Especially on foot Very durable also

These shoes are a must have I bought them after Christmas and they feel great I got them in all black they match with anything Im thinking about getting another pair of these Air Jordan 1s are a must cop

can not go wrong with mid 1Hold up better than AF1s too so I always keep fresh white on whites handy

Bought this product for my son for Christmas He absolutely loves it They look great fit good and are awesome for playing basketball in

Enjoy the white retro style offered in a well known well made shoe

I love this all white mid jordan 1 very comfortable and just clean for all occasions

It has good support for his arch and he likes the fit

Look so cool with me And it is cheaper than my country

Great shoes I was skeptical on ordering on line because my feet are really narrow but I did pull the trigger I was happy with the service and shoes I really like the free shipping and return service Also I do not need to travel to the mall because the Jordans I ordered are not available at the malls I looked at I would definitely recommend it to any hardcore air Jordan or Nike Air Force one fan like me

My boyfriend loves these sneakers I bought them in both black and white

Lowest price out there and my boyfriend absolutely loved them

I bought these to custom These shoes are a great canvas They are comfortable for walking Not really basketball

Goes well with anything and everything so its a must have

I love it so much Thinking I should buy more kind of this shoes

This is a great shoe and looks awesome on your foot

I ordered a custom pair of these a few months ago and im glad i did They are comfortable breathe well and are good to ball in with good ankle support If you have a wider foot i suggest getting your size and getting them streched

I love to buy Nike products especially like this it is super comfortable and I have nothing to say

The fit is true and the feel great I prefer Jordan 1 

Its a very nice all black shoe its not like other all black shoes It will match with mostly everything and has a nice fit to my feet I recommend you buy it

The shoes is nearly perfect I like it its cool and ecommend this to someone

The AJ1 never gets old All black works with everything a day this shoe works great for evening sneaker

Jordan 1 no doubt to mention about how it is unique and special for everyone you need to get this soon Please looking forward to having Jordan 1 metalic which releases soon

I love Jordans especially 1s nike com makes getting them easier great job guys

My husband loves his sneakers and this was the shoe he wanted He was happy to get them and loves them The shoes look good with a lot of things He said that they are super comfy My Nike experience is beyond pleasant as always

These shoes will never look dirty unless you step in mudd Easy to clean and look nice

A must have pair of Jordanfor any sneakers fan Very well made and classic versatile look They are very comfortable and will be a staple in my shoe collection I highly recommend these shoes

highly recommended keep buying from nike com

What you see is what you get Nice quality all black shoe no hype

exactly what was expected came out of box perfectly white

I like the material very durable also fits great Should have more colors available

I bought these for my son whose feet are a bit wide and he loves them

Perfect fit for playing basketball and lasts as long as you can play

100 satisfaction Excellent quality Would highly recommend

got these all whites as a blank canvas for a custom paint job Lining was dirty on one of the shoes as if the boxer had filthy hands Maybe it was a display pair somewhereCleaned up OK but would have hoped for a little better at least out the box

Awesome pair of shoes can wear with just about anything Thanks You

Nice comfortable shoes affordable prices Great online options Berry satisfied

I have only had the shoe for a short time now but it is very comfortable and looks great I do not use them to run they are so nice but if you wanted to I could see them being fine especially when playing basketball Great shoe and I highly recommend

I purchased this product for my son who is an avid fan of Nike Air Jordan series He loves the pair he got he is saving for the next pair

A clean classic shoe a real must have for any sneakerhead or jordan collector

I love the color schemes and the ankle support The only thing is that I would like there to be more colors

I wear a size 11 Like most Jordanthis is a narrow shoe Takes a few wears to break them in Slight discomfort in the toe area until it is broken in for me All in all a good purchase

I have these and have owned them since february I really put these shoes to the test and they have performed fantasticly They stay clean and break in very quick I would say one of the best retros i have had in terms of quality They still havent creased and ive had them for almost a year Would recomend to anyone who is on the fence about these

These are my first pair of Jordans I can now see the hype Super comfy and they look great The only reason I didnt give it a 4 star review is because of the toe creasing that starting as soon as I wore them

These are my first pair of Jordan 1and they do not disappoint The colorways are dope and the comfort is excellent I wear mine in the city all day and no issues yet

I bought these a couple weeks ago in need of some chunky white hi tops I have narrow feet and these fit me properly in my size but were too narrow for the first 2 weeks I broke them in now and they fit perfectly I like the look a ton and have been wearing them all the time They squeak all the time and are hard to do footwork in when dancing But that is to be expected since they are basketball shoes I would buy another pair any day though

This product was originally bought because of the name knowing that Nike is a reputable product Very comfortable just wished it was not such an expensive shoe I bought the shoes for my son who is only 16 and has many years to grow and I had to buy at Nike com because of the size 14 the stores do not carry a shoe in that size which can be an inconvenience

Very comfortable and stylish Wear these with any clothing and they look good

i wear them for casual events concerts casinos out door events there comfortable they fit well with casual clothing sports clothing there good for whatever you have planed for the day i would advise these to anyone for what ever event they plan for there day

The Air Jordan 1 mid is one of my favorite shoes to wear It has a original style that is timeless with a elegant design and it is very comfortable to wear all day I am very pleased with my purchase and with the product overall I would recommend this shoe to any and everybody young or old

To start off these shoes are very comfortable and for those who do not know most retro Jordanare usually very comfortable Another thing is that their is some texture on these shoes that you may not see in the picture which adds a nice touch In this particular pair of jordans they run a little narrow its ok but if not tolerable a half size bigger will due To end my review I will just say these shoes will brighten up a room so be sure to stay clear of mud for obvious reasons but if you do happen to incounter some mud or dirt these are pretty easy to clean with soap and water Well I hope my review helped and if you do decide to buy these you will not be disappointed

This brand of shoe is the best thing i ever bought They are super comfortable durable long lasting great for sports and overall very sleek They look and feel amazing They are very awesome shoes I am getting my new ones for school this year I chose black blue

Great comfortable sneaker Highly recommend Classic and not flashy

GODLY SHOE ALTHOUGH I WEAR A SIZE 9 THIS 9 WAS SMALL SO I WILL BE ORDERING A 9 5 I RECOMMEND THIS SHOE

These are a all time classic and work well with many outfits I highly recommend them

These shoes are comfortable and clean I wear them casually and they are all white so you can wear them with anything Very good quality does not crease in the toe box as much as air force 1 

Great shoes even better looks You can not go wrong with these bad boys

These shoes lasted me 1 and 1 2 years it was amazing but when you have them for that long they start to smell really bad

Nice color way and materials There comfortable for a AJ 1

Nice Shoe Stylish Fits true to size No creasing

Great looking shoe Runs narrow I do have wide feet but these were very narrow I returned for a half size up and broke them in and they get the job done Would definitely reccoment I got the black and red combo

I bought a pair of the black gym red anthracite pairs of jordan 1and I was very excited when I first go them but a few days after wearing them I came to realize one of the tongues was put on crooked so it tends to shift the the left side of the shoe which I can deal with Creasing is also a big problem with these shoes I thought because the toebox on my shoes was made of nubuck rather than leather it would not crease a fast I was wrong There is a huge crease on the right shoes after just walking around the school hallways for 2 days All in all I give them 1 7 10

The shoe is narrow other then that it fits perfectly

5 STARS

Jordan I is self explanatory no need to hype it up you already know Great Color Way Good Price Love the shoe

Very nice shoes style fits with almost anything

Has a nice fresh classic clean look Very comfy

Nice and pretty the swoosh is in different material Looks nice and shiny

Classic Jordan high top very comfortable and super happy with the quality as always

Really comfortable shoes Crease easy My first pair of JordanLove them

nice kicks might grab another pair of all whites

Classic old school Great shoe that is a must have to add to your collection

JORDAN AIR JORDAN

If you like the regular air forces this is for you

Have over 10 pair of Jordan 1s This colorway is definitely one of my favorites

Very comfortable Classic old school style Classic Chicago color way with the black and red Love them

i love the shoe especially if you like the og retro stile with the white shoe box and middle area and dark toe this shoe is dope

These are my first pair of Air Jordan 1 I have worn They are perfect for any of my outfits Also gives lots of support in the ankles and very comfortable to be in 100 recommend to anyone who like or loves sneakers

Can not go wrong with this purchase

These are nice for the spring and summer the color pops

This shoe is very comfortable but you would be better off going 5 up than your normal size probably

I really like these shoes but they run too narrow which makes them hard to brake in

shoes are great and priced well the only problem is the toebox creases easy but they are shoes so that will happen they do run a half size big

shoes easily crease just like some air force 1s I usually wear a 10 5 the size is true and the pair i got is slightly narrow with the left shoe it might be an imperfection in the shoe but overall the quality is good I will say again I might of walked 32 steps and they creased already I knew it was going to happen the shoe is all leather and the box is different from the regular Jordan boxes

They are soooo comfortable and true to size Definitely best purchase

Great deal and they become one of my favorite shoes I use this for casual and play basketball sometimes Very comfortable and good looking shoes i like it

Love them fit just right and it is extremely comfortable also reminds me of my high school days

The black teal and purple colors caught my eyes So then I checked the price and SOLD The sale price was only 49 99 not bad for cute work shoes I wear a Men8m in athletic shoes and these give me enough room and they are light weight on the feet If they had memory foam insoles they would feel alot better after wearing them for 8 hours Overall great pair of fashionable Reeboks Get lots of compliments too

Terrific shoe I bought this shoe to match with some clothes I bought and I was not disappointed The style and the fit of the shoe is perfect and I will definitely be shopping again

I loved these back in the 90s but could not afford a pair I now have 2 pairs and I want more The design is rad they are comfy with many cool colorways and you can not beat the price If you are new to Reebok retrostart with these

Not as great as I hoped they would be but they are wonderful for every day wear

Nice design but too wide

If you have worn adidas boost shoes before these are just as comfortable as any of the other designs they are very lightweight and super comfortable for walking around daily Would definitely recommend for your collection

Tried one when it was first released in the summer and thought of purchasing another pair The shoes is very comfy and excellent choice for casual wear Strongly recommended

I have wide feet so it is hard to find shoes that fit without constricting or stretching over the sides These fit almost perfectly Maybe a little tight width wise but the shoe comes with a removable insole that when taken out makes the space perfect for me But the discomfort is minimal so I keep it for the extra cushioning Would recommend for wide footers As always the pure boost makes it feel like you are walking on a cloud

Great fit feel and style True to size and very comfortable These shoes were worth every penny The best adidas I have ever owned and may not ever wear nike again Take them for a run or a workout you will not be disappointed

Great cushion smooth look very comfortable A great purchase

These are great for running Very light and comfortable for long distances

Very comfortable Very stylish do not know what else to say

In my case it is SO hard to find a pair of Pureboost tennis that is not too narrow or my toes feel so shrink Please Adidas make Ultraboost and Pureboost comfortably for people with wide feet that do not look too bulky like the niteJoggers Thanks

Great look and feel one of the greatest if not the best shoes I have tried on from Adidas and have already received several compliments from peers Keep up the good work Adidas

I loved it great for MEN Great way to start the week with new shoes I love slipping them off before i get in bed letting all my foot juices out and into the air

I like thos product because it is comfortable and light

Some reviews said they ran too large and some too small so I ordered an 11 5 like I usually do and the fit was perfect Fits nice and snug around your foot and the boost material is just as comfortable as always The black on black look a lot darker than they are in person but they still look great

Have only taken these out for a few runs so far but they are crazy addictive to run in They achieve the holy grail of sneaker satisfaction which is to disappear on your feet You just put them on run and smile

These are really comfortable The back of the heel is a bit low or short compared to other shoes so it feels a bit odd in the rear of the shoe but other than that the shoe is fantastic so I guess I will just live with almost perfect as I have never actually found a 10 in my life for shoes

This is a good alternative to the ultraboost at a fraction of the cost Will be using these at the gym

Almost as comfortable as ultraboosts Fair price for shoe

I own practically every sneaker in the Boost franchise and these are now my few favorite due to the price point I feel I am getting a very high quality and comfortable sneaker for the money without the guilt of spending almost 2 Bennies for UltraBoost They feel very close to my UB in overall comfort and I feel Adidas has a true winner here The look is fantastically minimal and sleek The sole is almost identical to the UB minus the Torsion but walking around I barely notice the Torsion is even missing I really hope Adidas builds on this franchise because it is an incredible sleeper in my book I will be buying more colorways for sure

The shoes are very comfortable I love them but when I bought them there was only 2 left so my shoe came in and there was a stain Not noticeable but unable to remove it Great shoes but upset they sent me a damaged one

If you have a larger heel this shoe is not great First of all the shoe takes forever to get on and is narrow when getting on and wearing The shoe is a great running shoe and is good if you only care about speed The pads are comfy but wear quickly The overall quality is still very good and lasting Anyone with bony feet or large heels may find this shoe hard to get on or uncomfortable to wear

Awesome designa and size is perfect The high top felt a little weird when I wore it the first time might be the insole but overall love their products

I love it so much it is very comfortable and perfect

Bought for my teenage Son He enjoys the look and I enjoy the breathability and lightness He says they are very comfortable

I do not like this product because the shoes were very flimsy and they looked very cheap

Hard to get on especially when in an uncomfortable situation

This is my first pair of Adidas in years and I have to say I have been missing out on these boost soles Super cushion with decent stability these shoes are extremely comfortable The reinforcement zones on the knit material are a nice touch I hope it helps the knit material to last as long as possible

I love the price of the shoe and the quality of the upper is amazing love wearing this shoe

I am 61 years old These are the best shoes that have ever been on my feet over my entire life As soon as I put them on they make me want to run Incredible

This is my first pair of Pureboost but will not be the last I initially kept them for comfort longs days standing walking but I get compliments on them almost every time I wear them

I liked the boost of the shoe its like walking in the clouds

These shoes are incredibly comfortable it is like walking on a marshmallow The only issues I had are the seam around the last lace loop was poking into my ankle on both shoes Also the toe box is a bit shallow in height The width and length are right for me but the height of the toe box is so shallow that the material is stretched over your toes I found this the case on both shoes but the left more than the right Going up a half size may help but I am hoping they will just stretch a little as they age because it is not that big of a deal Nice kicks

You could hot glue gun these laces after double knotting and ziptying them they still will come untied no matter what Makes any run frustrating as these are otherwise great shoes

My shoe burnt the outside melted but there very comfy

These shoes are perfect for working out at the gym

I bought these shoes for work since we are required to have all black shoes and I am incredibly satisfied They are comfy add a lot of spring to your step and are good for wearing for a long time I usually work 6 8 hour retail shifts If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive shoe with black Boost these are definitely going to be your best bet Highly recommend for anyone looking for work shoes running shoes or just a comfy and stylish pair of shoes

My brother got into running recently and loves these He said they are great and make running easy

The shoe itself is very comfortable it is a nice shoe with a mixture of up to date technology and throwback modern style just how I like it I have a pair of the OG pureboost and these blow those away just based off comfort alone

these are one of the most comfy shoes in my arsenal

The little differences from the regular Pureboost make it not as good of a shoe in my opinion Ultraboosts are the softest and most comfortable but at 220lbs I feel the Pureboosts and Pureboost Goare more supportive and have better bounce back

the shoe is so comfortable and lightweight The color is good

Excellent cushioning breathable upper make it an excellent choice for my training runs

The comfort on these is nearly that of an UltraBoost These have a very sporty look to them I like the lack of a plastic cage on the sides and love the attached tongue since it looks to be detached They seem a little shallow in the toe box my big toe hits agains the top more in these than in other Adidas shoes I removed the insole and feel that they fit better although I then have some extra room all around

I love these shoes I have two pair and I run in one pair and use the other as a casual shoe They are so comfortable for running and walking and by the way I was at a restaurant a little while ago and one of the waiters noticed my shoes and said Dude your shoes are so Fly 

Very comfortable shoes Makes running much more enjoyable Very stylish as well

They are light comfortable easy to maintain and will last

I have around 10 pairs of ultraboost and pureboost shoes This was my first pair of pureboost go and they are a half size too long for some odd reason

The heel is not deep enough and the toe box is too tight

I really like this shoe It was a little large and when I tried to are order it was out of stock

The shoes are very comfortable They are now my favorite to wear out of my huge selection of shoes

ConsShoebottom foam area is little too bulky it makes your feet look bigger than actual size

They are a great shoe once you get the right size and they really feel like a hug on your foot

It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever bought It takes away much stress from my knees when I go on a walk or run

Was looking for a shoe that was comfotable stylist and could take punishment in the Gym Gives you a snug fit with a good stance and lots of support

My son loves these shoes They fit well and true to size He has only started wearing them so I cannot comment yet regarding durability

I have been running for most of my life and never had a shoe this comfortable

Thea shoes look amazing and feel amazing The look of them is super clean I actually prefer this look over the ultra boost They got that boost comfort so you can walk forwverbin them If you have a wide foot I also recommend these These shores would be perfect if it was not for one major issue these shoes are super unsafe due to the lack of grip on wet surfaces such as sidewalks after or during rain They feel like you are walking on a side walk wearing cleats If you love I am an area that never sees moisture then only perfect show but if you live in a rainy area it would be a dangerous option

Loved them would buy another pair for sure A

The shoe is extremely comfortable and fits like a sock Looks great too

super lightweight and comfortable very good purchase

super comfy shoes and durable overall would buy again

shoes were comfortable and great overall would buy again

boost material is great for walking and running

it is very good looking and highly comfortable especially for working out

Great shoe for everyday wear as well as gym workouts was not as comfortable for elliptical work No structural issues yet with shoe Appears to be well constructed

My husband loves them Great comfy shoes Adidas is the top shoe

Very comfortable Great running shoes Very light weight feels like you are walking on bouncy playground flooring

Great fit all around Love the design Fits just right

I am a runner of 40 years and I have run in LOTS of shoes in that time and these are at the top of the pile The fit is spot on a little support for side to side movement nice toe box and the bootie fit snugs the shoe and becomes an extension of your foot Shoes feel amazing for shorter or longer runs to 16 miles far as I have gone in them and the BOOST works GREAT in normal range temps but also works in MUCH MUCH lowers temps and the Continental rubber on the bottom have the best grip of ANY shoes I have worn wet cold ice snow mud and rain sure footing every step

Super comfy got for my brother After having for a few months comfort still there has not stretched much strong knit new look compared to last model

Shoe fits pretty narrow so i would go up half a size which may help overall its comfortable for either casual wear or running seems like it is good quality looks very nice on foot i would recommend that however like most sneakers now a days trying them on in person is always best but half a size up is what I did

Great fit Good short distance running or good for walking

This shoe is very comfortable but there should be more suppport in the upper to make the shoe more comfortable The shoe is super wide with the boost coming out that it makes one look very fat

the inside lining is not smooth and it rubs the inside of your ankle bad design

The shoes started to tear at the sole within only 3 days of wearing do not get me wrong very comfortable shoe but the quality is absolutely terrible 3 DAYS

Overall decent running shoe and a great alternative to UltraBoost if you are on a budget Boost cushioning is the star on this model The width is perfect I would say wide foot friendly but they run long so there is room in the toebox I have an average medial side arch so at first the upper was snug around the midfoot making them feel a bit shallow because the upper is not stretchy like Primeknit I would normally pull out the insoles but after a few wears on the treadmill the insoles pack down the upper loosens a bit and they fit great Mesh upper is somewhat breathable decent traction on the outsole Would recommend for workers on their feet all day and casual runners

Comfort look design i wear them for running

These shoes are very comfortable That is the first thing I noticed The sizing does appear to be a little small compared to my other adidas shoes though The knit webbing on the top conforms to the foot though so I do not really notice that it is a little smaller Overall great shoes and I was happy to add them to my boost collection

Shoes is an adaptive knit it is snug to keep your foot in place while running The boost is definitely more responsive and adaptive for street runs Will buy again

About to return

My new favorite shoe Fits perfectly and very comfortable Great value

I did not know what to expect since I have never purchased a shoe just for running But I am glad I did make the decision to purchase these pair of shoes These shoes are so comfortable it is unbelievable Great job Adidas

My personal opinion is better fit and better comfort than ultra boost Not a loose fit but not as form fitting snug fit as ultra boost but similar boost sole feel For price would recommend these over any boost shoe

The mesh material was not what i expected as well as the color other wise great running shoes

Fit is off They fit big and makes toes uncomfortable

Great for leisure activities but not as comfortable as the ultra boost

Would have been better with rounded laces instead of the flat one

A very comfortable shoe I needed something for walking around the city and this is great

The best running shoes i have ever had They are supper comfortable

I love the cushioning that the boost midsole provides

Following in the trend of excellenceAdidas PureBoost are light weight extremely comfortable and manufactured to perfection

This is a good shoe Not as good as the ultraboost but good I tried on a pair in store and it was a size smaller than what I usually wear So I bought a half size smaller and it is a little tight Especially when I have the insoles in the shoes I tried wearing without them but did not like the feel

These are great Perfect for exercising or for doing anything else

they are comfortable and lightweight what more do I need to say

If you take the insole out it is even more comfortable

I bought it and was expecting it to be similar to the ultraboost but it is very directed towards performance and is exactly what I was looking for They are perfect for running as your foot will not slip unlike primeknit

Very comfortable Awesome design True size and they look just like in the picture

I like these shoes better than the other two shoes I have had with boost Nmd XR1 and Pureboost DPR I like this one a lot considering it is price and how comfy it is

Comfort style color brand is the best Will order more

Very comfortable have sum stretch to them would highly recommend them

Best boost technology I have experienced Nothing else is as comfortable or more importantly supportive for your feet Wear them as lifestyle and workout shoes

Style is nice and is very comfortable for running

The shoes were a gift for my pops and he fell in love with them right out of the box

Help my shin splints and back pain They look great too

I have a wide food and was concerned about the support around my arch I previously ran in the Boost ZG and liked the lace cage but quickly found comfort in the pureboost go

Love the style finish and comfort of these shoes

I can run and do HIIT training in these Great support

It is a really nice pair of shoes they did not fit well though

Great fit for these shoes Very snug but the arch fit in having a little trouble with Shoes a bit bulky especially heels

They are great He said they are very comfy and he likes wearing them he has been wearing them almost everyday since he got them

Great for gym running and everyday wear Very light and responsive

I love everything about this shoe except that they do a little squeak when walking in them 4 5 stars

they are just really great looking shoes and are very comfortable

Very comfortable while working out it Also fits well on my foot

it is comfortable good fit but squeaks when walking fast It might go away after a while

Good performance by the shoe as expected When you wear it first time it seems to be a little tight but within a day or two it becomes comfortable and easy to wear

Great Comfortable shoe Runs about 1 2 size too big Durability is my concern The shoe is very light but at the same time very thin in some areas Time will tell I want to love these shoes but find myself going back to my Other brand shoes that rhyme with rooks

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I would buy again

I love the Boost brand for running as well as walking and they are fashionable too

This latest iteration of the pure boost model really impressed me Pure boost used to be a cut down ultra boost with less cushioning amongst other things Now I think it might have a little more cushioning The upper is a little less soft and stretchy without primeknit but other than that it is just as good in my eyes

I am on my feet 12 14 hours at my job I needed something comfortable with a bouncy response I hit the jack pot with this purchase

Lightweight and durable with ample arch support Thanks

Not as comfortable as the ultraboost but very comfortable for such a cheap price point

It seems every pit of sneakers purchased from adidas were larger then the size I requsted

Super comfy on feet while either vacationing or taking a walk

I work in healthcare and wear these shoes for long periods of time and I find that towards the end of a long 12 hour shift my feet ankles are killing me I have always works adidas and prefer them over most but those are unfortunately not as comfortable as past shoes I have worn

This sneaker is great especially at its price point Very comfortable with it being loaded with boost I would definitely be getting another pair in a different color way

Looking great And its light Good for jogging or walking

Light weight comfortable and great for running Would recommend to anyone

purchased for grandson18th birthday He loves them Wears size 14 and you had his size Put them on immediately and said very comfortable

This is definitely not a running shoe Opening area around ankle made of cloth like a sock and offers no support whatsoever The bottom of the show is much to wide like duck feet no kidding making it next to impossible to run on

Love the shoe except for the stitching on the tongue that catches and snags sock I ruined a few pair of socks before I realized what was happening Otherwise shoe looks and feels great

Light weight shoe and is very comfortable to wear

it would have been nice to know that less than a week after ordering the shoe it was going to be on sale for almost 40 00 less

Love these shoes and would recommend to anyone Way to set it up adidas

I recommend these because of how comfortable they are I have owned mine for a week now and am very impressed with the boost material it is very reactive and comfortable when I go on runs it keeps me going because my feet do not hurt after a good 30 mins

A

it is a comfortable running Sneakers Will recommend it

This shoe is amazing It was my first boost shoe and was not dissapointed It had great stability on the balls of my foot and a lot of cushioning My only complaint is that the shoe laces seem to always come undone

Shoe is a perfect fit I like the thin material Sole width took some adjusting to since I usually buy soccer shoes but they are so great I want another pair

Alot more comfortable than previous pureboost models

They look nice but they are tight on the toes My big toe was hurting after wearing the sneakers for awile

Great for an all around shoe that is built too wash every night Great traction and simple groove too how they move You can run well in them compared too the ultra boost but when it comes too jogging there substantial Walking is nice and Poppy like no other flat and main line They now need a more spit in the foot palm like the Swiftfor moving on stairs and inclines more agile Top of the line as of right now Thanks pals at adidas

I like the product but they are definitely whiter than expected from the pictures Still love them Only have had a week and they do so some signs of wear with the thin outside

Not very comfortable it is too wide and the sole pokes you

The shoes I bought is comfortable and is what I expected for running shoes

These shoes are awesome and I love the colorway Got these in store at the Irvine CA location Very happy with my purchase

Stylish and very comfortable Excedeed my expectations

 

Excelent for running purposes Very comfortable The best cushion

No foot support for any type of sport The material is suitable for walking but thats it

Let adidas do the rest

I like the shoe but they ride low in the back There is also a spot on the inside of the tongue where the material presses into my foot more than it should Overall worth the buy as they are comfortable

These shoes are really comfortable I got them because I walk to work and I am always standing they are definitely worth it Compared to my old shoes they are a 100x better

Look great feel great run great Highly recommend

It is great to just wear around or run the black and white is a great color combinationBOOSTISLIFE

These shoes are very comfortable and I recommend you get them

Nice looking shoes and very comfortable Sizing however is dissapointing and nowhere close to other Adidas Boost shoes I have worm or currently wear Order one full size smaller than you think is correct Also concerned the collar of the shoe may be too flimsy for proper support while running Returning for smaller size and will give them a try

This is my 2 nd pair I love this color good quuality thanks adidas

Great build quality and perfect fit also the most comfortable shoes ever

My toes move around they keep sliding forward in front of shoe

I have 3 pair and I love them Great shoes

Was really worried about sizing but I got my normal size and It worked out perfect I have not worn Adidas a ton but these ones I really liked I do not like flashy stuff but the hint of color dang It looks good

This shoe looks good and feels good A little pricey though

Very good quality shoe The materials are lite and the comfort level is perfect with the amount of boost This has been added to my rotation and will not leave until they are worn down or replace with it is successor

it is nowhere near the ultraboost or Uncaged but it is a good shoe if you seeking some boost action of the outsole The tongue is the weakest element of the shoe Adidas needs to go back to the drawing board

The Pureboost Go shoes are pretty nice It has a knitted upper Boost technology in the midsole and pretty solid sole as well If you were to take a picture of the shoe from the midsole down then it looks just like the Ultraboost The knitted upper is a little bit different it is a little bit thicker to provide some additional stability Since there are no plastic three stripes like the ones on the Ultraboost the midfoot and laces have some extra reinforcement to ensure that your foot is properly locked down and locked in to take on those power runs The thing I like about the Pureboost Go over the Ultraboost is its flatter sole which makes it a little bit better for doing some weight training in the gym as well All in all this is a pretty solid shoe and if you do not want to spend the extra 60 to get the Ultraboost the Pureboost Go might be your best alternative

this is my first pair of boost shoes and I am impressed they fell so bouncy and light when I walk and I like that they come in nice color more comfy than NMD and best running shoe I have worn in my life

the eyelet for the laces broke on day one Sending back as defective

it is like walking on gel all day As a matter of fact Ive ordered Pureboost shoes for my wife

It had been a while since I purchased Adidias running shoes and these are possibly the most comfortable pair I have ever owned

I only wanted to make people aware that the insoles turn into 1990s slap stick bracelets after pulling them out of the dryer Plus they shrunk haha

I tried adidas a few months ago buying a pair of running shoes Alphabounce to get back on running they suit me perfectly soft and comfortable this new product is even better I am now I have turned into a loyal Adidas fan

Super cushioned Maximum comfort Stylish kicks for everyday wear

The rubber started peeling on bottom after literally a day of wear The black is peeling into the white color now near the heel outsole split Not the end of the world but still frustrating

It is not a bulky shoe It is light and comfortable

These shoes have a great fit and are extremely comfortable I love the Pure Boost They have the look of a running shoe for sure so do not plan on wearing them as lifestyle But they are so comfortable you all be tempted to anyway

Comfort stylish and quality okay but go up a half size

Great shoes I have always loved the boost midsoles and Adidas did a great job with the Pureboosts The upper feels like a thin but durable sock Plenty of wiggle room in the toe box but not because of imperfect sizing more to do with the flexibility of the material Oh and they look incredible With football season coming up my wife and I have really been struggling she is Ole MissI am Tennessee I was really worried until I started wearing my pureboosts around the house Now she can not keep her hands off of me and she continuously sings Rocky Top These things are miracle workers Thanks Adidas for saving my marriage

I love the look of the shoe and it is very comfortable I know it is marketed as an urban running shoe but I view it as more of a lifestyle shoe The upper fabric is very comfortable but does not breathe as well as anticipated The back edge of the upper also sits very low and sometimes gives the feeling you could step out of the shoe I did have to order up a half size for the proper fit Overall a good shoe minus the couple complaints

I like it because they are not too expensiv and they are very comfortable

Super comfortable and look great Great for at the gym or running errands

This is by far the most comfortable boost shoe I have bought so far

Amazing fit and comfort Perfect balance between cushioning and stability

Bought these because they claim to have wide toe room Opposite is true Fit very narrow you all want to go at least a half size up if you are still interested Also they are the nosiest running shoes I have ever owned It sounds like you are running on soaking wet shag carpet with each step Last the foam cushion is very rounded forcing your feet to roll in with each strike These are 100 designed for looks not actual running

Very comfortable shoe gives a lot of support especially on heels

I have went on 1 run so my review might be biased and I only went two miles But it was very comfortable I usually wear a 9 5 but got a 9 because it felt better

These are replacing another pair of boosts that after miles of runs dog walks and urban rural hikes needed to go but were still so comfortable These are just a fantastic and they really help with my back problems

These shoes are super comfortable right out of the box I Highly recommend these

Got everything I need I can recommend this shoes to my friends and family

Looks good and is comfortable You can tell that the material will wear down over time but that is due to the shoe being so comfortable and light which I do not have a problem with

Really great pair of shoes Nice and comfortable They fit well as well

The shoe design looks good except for the sole Also need to buy a half size up

Great comfort simply the best thank you Adidas I would recommend to anyone

Absolutely love these shoes They fit perfect and feel comfortable all day Highly recommend

I was really looking forward to these because they look great and have a wider forefoot I have wide feet I was devastated when I tried them on though because there is a place on the innersole at the top of the eyelets on the inside of the foot where some of the fabrics are sewn together and there is no padding This dug into my foot and was really bothersome I tried on 2 pairs to make sure it was not bad quality control on the first they both did it Shame

Love this shoe Again Adidas does a masterful job of making a shoe that is so comfortable Must buy this shoe

The fit is good very snug and supportive Forefoot is wider than normal which for wide feet is good Cushion is as boost is very springy and giving back energy Colors are typically Adidas conservative Nothing really too wild most of the time Take a chance a buy these and then render your opinion

Most comfortable shoes I have ever had They are also really stylish I would recommend these to anyone

Amazing looking sneakers I was so disappointed on how narrow the PG3 are I was not able to get my foot in and even after unlacing the sneaker Will return them

I love these shoes They are super comfortable and require so little break in time I wish there were more colourways though And please PLEASE bring the NikeiD for this back

The shoe was very very good it had traction cushion and style but Nike PLEASE BRING THE ID OPTION FOR THESE

Of course I bought these right after Zion obliterated his PG 2 5 by taking a heavy step

Runs a slight bit tight at first you just have to are arrange the laces if that is an issue The forefoot zoom unit is BEEFY felt it right away no break in time needed and I am lighter than most at 150lbs The phylon is very soft and is a step up from the PGs i feel as if its better than the cushlon in the Kyrie 4the traction is on point and the lockdown is amazing as usual

Just copped and wore them for about 5 hours of pickup yesterday great ankle support and incredible traction Love the design of the shoe as well They do take a little bit of time to break in a bit stiff under the foot at first but stay with it and they will get very comfy They do run a bit narrow if you like a more snug fit its the shoe for you

I am super bummed These shoes look awesome but I could barely get my foot in The toe area is extremely cr and ed Never even got both on at the same time

I have been running with regular pegasus 35 and added this for running in the rain I used in heavy rain ran through paddles but it kept water free inside So for that purpose it works Only downside is because of the water proof materials if you use in sunny days your feet may feel too warm

I brought these because i needed to find a shoes that supported my arches and would be comfortable runnjng in Well i picked the right shoe I have fallen arches and i usually have to get inserts for my shoes but so far i am not in need for them with this shoe they run slightly big i could have gotten a 1 2 size smaller for a snug fit because i do not wear socks with these

I pulled these shoes out of the box this morning and did what every runner does with new shoestook them for a test drive and got them dirty If you live in Maine Montreal Minnesota or Mercer Island Wa these shoes are for you I have been running in Nike shoes for two decades and the fit was spot on The uppers are pretty snug so I would recommend trying them on in the store first The laces are unique but worked great The soles had solid grip on wet blacktop although all new shoes generally do but the footbed was comfortable and felt like the standard Pegasus ride My feet were warm and stayed dry on a four mile test drive Perfect winter running shoe can not wait to try them in the snow Thanks Nike

I really wanted to like these but the toe box is waaayyyy too tight and the arch is high as others have indicated Great idea poor execution Returned

I cannot even get them on If you have a high instep they are WAY WAY too tight

I have only done 20 miles on these But so far I like the mid foot strike bounce Also I love the laces Most triathlon shoes come with these and I can not understantd why these are not standard for running shoes I am worried with my weight the cushion will not last

These have a very shallow instep The profile is very low and when I walk run in these I feel like my heel will slip out It does not slip out but it feels insecure like my foot does not quite fit in the shoe all the way

I had high hopes for these shoes I liked their style Their waterproofing features seemed well thought out Their material appeared to be softer and hence more comfortable wearing than the Lunarglide H2O Repel shoes I currently use for very wet and messy days Unfortunately it was a struggle getting them on I had to resort to taking out the insoles to get my feet in the shoes Admittedly my feet have high insteps so this probably will not be an issue for most people All in all they seem like they would be a good wet weather conditions running shoe for prople that can get them on

I hope you guys keep wheeling these things in These wolf greys are the 3rd pair I bought in 3 months and they are fire

So far ok I am having an issue where the opening on my left foot is stabbing into the outside of my ankle Hopefully it is just a breaking in thing I have only had them on today Other than that comfy and light weight

Very comfortable sneakers and looks very nice

Love them The neon red is my favorite accent color and getting them on sale is a great deal

These shoes are comfortable and light weight However the colors pictured are way off I ordered the white pair that appeared to have accents of black but they are NOT black The accents are more of an orange red neon color Totally not what I was looking for

Extremely Comfortable Exactly what I was looking for classic look and nice colors Grey Orange

I love the look of these shows And the fit fine except for one piece I had to order a smaller size because the back of the show kept slipping off my heal I wear a lot of different shoes and this is the only pair I have had this happen with

Was trying to find a good shoe I will not be buying other shoes besides these for a while Loved them

A good casual shoe you can wear everyday very good price for a great quality of shoe a must have

This is my second time ever buying a pair of New Balances and I am glad I did The shoe is very comfortable as well as stylish I can not wait to buy more and recommend them to anybody

The shoe looks and matches really well with anything and I got it at a very good price if you are questioning getting it you should get it

I recently decided to broaden my variety by looking into retro runners other than airmax and so I got this pair Everything I heard of new balance is confirmed Premium materials solid construction comfort BUT your heel can kind of slip out because the heel felt a little loose despite being fully laced Wear a thicker pair of socks or maybe go a half size down Point is I know this now and can not wait to get more new balances

I love how these look and get lots of compliments They are very light Great warm hot weather shoe of how light and breathable they are The sole is a different than the typical shoe and feels slightly awkward at first when you are not used to them But it is not a reason to stay away from these

I have used this shoes for less than 5 months and already the sole of my left shoe is separating from the rest of the shoe it is really disappointing I have had nike before and never happened not even after many years I want to think it was just this pair that was defective because the use was pretty normal 3 days a week or less I would have expect them to last more especially with the use I give them Other than that they run small but after seizing up they fit perfectly very comfortable and stylish

Looks great on feet Pretty comfortable after I wore them all day First time I wore them they did feel a bit tight and bugged my toe but once I broke them in they felt great

The sizing of the cortez is very different from other Nike models You need to size up 0 5 inches if YOU HAVE WIDE FEET

Always great Comfort and style keeps up with the trends still to this day

I recommend them to anyone that that has any knee problems because they are light comfortable and easy on your legs

A very timeless classic good construction and actually decently comfortable

Great show to be stylish in or to be active Comfortable and durable I would say they fit true to size

Always a great shoe and very comfortable I have had a pair since i was about 8 Takes me back to the old days Before the dark times before the Empire

Really like the look and they are super comfortable Will get them again when these ware out

Just like I remember them from when I was a kid Great memories

The fit and comfort are great The shoes with the black on black accents allow me to wear them on dressier occasions with out being seen I can stand all day when wearing my Pumas

For what I paid I am glad I bought them But I would not have been happy had I paid much more

Bought for my son wrong size Yet good size for me

I bought these for my daughter I loved the style of the sneaker and most of all it was a great deal My daughter loved the look of the shoe and she said they are extremely comfortable

Nice good deal excellent style the color is all i wanted

Brought these for my niece for Christmas and she loved them She was super happy when she unwrapped them They go with everything she says and she lovesaid them

I have a few pair of pumas all size 13 and these are about an inch shorter than all the rest Bought them for work and can not even wear them

These shoes look good and feel great The order was fast and was on time I from finshline all the time

Got this for 39 buck very nice style good leather very comfortable

I like these I got the perfect size absy it fits well I would buy these again just a diff color

They are a beautiful pair of shoes and are true to size in length but are slightly narrow

I really liked the look and thought the price was great These shoes are comfortable and I can wear them with anything I definitely recommend

I bought both white and black versions of these shoes cause I needed to flash both colors I used to own a pair of these a long time ago and have never found a pair more comfortable than these The Puma Roma have always and will probably always be the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever purchased

Nice light weight shoe Great for casual wear I wear these with a Polo and jeans

so nice great

Love the style and comfort of the shoe Would recommend this shoe

I like nike air max and white goes with almost everything Gift for other

I can wear them all day everyday

looks so good and comfortable shoes such an amaizing shoes

Best fit for jeans jogger and cargo pants

It was a very satisfying deal

What a difference a pair of shoes makes These are like walking on a cloud for both everyday wear and workouts I broke them in at boot c and yesterday and they were beyond comfortable can not recommend these enough especially for men with wide feet

Bought them for my boyfriend and he loved them now he will not stop wearing them The style and color goes with any outfit and it has this reflective sheen to it pretty dope ima end up buying some myself Definitely recommend

I bought the shoes for my son we wear Air Max because they are one of the most comfortable shoes made

Will often use

I had these sneakers as a teenager and just brought them for my son Classic They still look and fit perfect

Got them in all white very aesthetically pleasing shoe I usually run in Huaraches but the 97 offered plenty of support for miles of walking did take a couple walks to wear them in kind of stiff at first Definitely a very stable shoe great for support during gym work outs Love nike from the 90 and super happy to add the 97 to my collection

This shoe looks like a Sketchers knock off Very disappointing nike

I ordered the shoes based on the pictures and when I had seen them on other people but when I opened the box I was surprised because they were actually pretty ugly Like I said I was very surprised because they looked so good in pictures They are also very narrow which is not a bad thing if your feet are the right shape but it is something that people should be aware of

The inside of the right shoe soul is thicker then the left foot Very uncomfortably I ordered the black and orange one had to send back now the blue and white are made the same way SMH BEWARE

I have never really like the styling of the AM 97 but the all black nocturnal colorway is by far the one that did it for me The black takes away from the wavy design look and placed on the white sole gives it a more sleeker look I would say they run big because I wear a 9 but picked up these in 8 5 and they fit great They are not the most comfortable so these are definitely good for casual wear could not be more happier so glad they are released these in April because it took me 21 years to finally cop a pair

I have loved this shoe since my best buddy Austin had them back in 1997 It was futuristic at that point in time and has turned into a 20 year classic it is just as comfy now as it was back then Runs TTS in my opinion and even good if your foot is a little wide like mine Great summer sneaker

I only wear these for casual wear or go lift at the gym They look good with some pants on sweats or shorts I can wear them all day and they feel comfy Comfort is everything for me That being said it took a couple of wears to break in the shoe was tight on my toes

I love the Nike Air max shoes and have been running in these for years But they are too wide for my foot and I hope Nike will make this product available in a 12 for Men

Very comfortable I will recommend to anyone to purchase

Looks good Feels pretty comfortable Size and fit are perfect Idk about durability have not had them long enough to know Kind of a heavy shoe if you care about that sort of thing I do not run in these shoes nor do I recommend it

Great shoe and great price fast shipping Item as described extremely satisfied Pleasure to deal with will def be doing business with again Huge fan of Nike product no disappointment with these shoes highly recommended Shoes are great for what I was looking for On my feet all day 12 hours a day constantly moving around at job Shoes def provide excellent support and comfort Will be buying the other color to have a Back up pair of these shoes

The toe box on these is a bit narrow and pointed The strip that runs around the heel is actually a hard plastic ridge that I can feel digging into my heel when I walk I do not understand the plastic ridge on the heel at all except to provide potential discomfort The laces are too thin so that if you need to tighten them they dig in to the foot At this price point I expect a thoughtful shoe not a mess of good ideas that fail to come together

thesemare amazing Have a couple pairs of oddesy react and other rear shoes These are great for rainy days Extremely waterproof and sooo comfy Just go half size up as all react shoes run narrow in the toe box Great sneakers

Usually these type of running shoes are too narrow so i just went half a size bigger and they are alright

I have 5 pairs and counting and I had to pick these up in the Tech Beige color way

The full boost sole is fantastic for going and doing anything besides maybe sports it is a little too clunky with too little support for that

I love how you can You can wear this with everything

This shoe is so beautiful and comfortable This is my 4th NMD shoe and they are all incredibly good quality 10 10

The shoes look dope they are comfortable and look good with a lot of outfits

This is a great pair of shoes They are perfect for working out or switch it up and wear them on date night

Like the fit a little big but perfect for me I got the triple whites and they are great as a beater pair

Great fitting with all the comfort one would expect from an NMD shoe The color way might not be for everyone but I love them I will have to keep an eye out for a second pair for when these get worn out

These are really comfortable shoes and look good I would order half a size up to get the perfect fit

What I do not like about this shoe is the long laces

My grandson loved these He said they fit his feet perfectly and that they were really comfortable Also at a great PRICE

I also been caught in the rain while wearing them before and oddly enough dirty barely shows up on them after they dry I have gotten a bunch of dirty on the tips of the toes and i can barely even see it anymore would definitely buy again

Very comfortable on feet and light weight Wear them all the time

I like the color of this shoes perfect for summer

First thing first This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The only downside is that I ordered a size up by accident Other than that a great shoe

Love the color way on these r2s great budget adidas

this is a great shoe def recomended ill buy it again

Normally I was not a fan of the NMD fit However these R2were a fine exception Super comfortable and breathable material

Nothing like a crispy pair of fresh whites for the summer

Aesthetic performance delivering shoe that is a good sequel to the NMD series

I am very pleased with these shoes Light and very comfortable All that and stylish too

Went a half size down on this shoe R2are nice R1are better

extremely stylish and comfortable great for both casual and sports activities

Nice color combination Goes with many different outfits

I went on a whim and bought these when they were running a NMD sale I could not be happier They look really sharp and clean I own another pair of NMDs that fit a little big but these are a good size Not as comfy as ultraboosts obvisouly But they are good shoes that you will look good in Love all my adidas shoes

Comfortable and value for money also it fits me perfectly well

dig the shoe except for the tongue which folds under inside the shoe and slides around to no end

Just got these shoes and there is a weird bump on them idk if it is supposed to be like that

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn even more so after I have broken them in a bit

New style Cheap and Good for everyday use Fast delivery

I love the look of these shoes and the material and details are great The problem is that there is a harder piece of foam at the mid point in the heel that gets pretty uncomfortable after a day of wear I do not have particularly wide or flat feet but this stiffer section really starts to get uncomfortable for me If I had a higher arch or slightly narrower feet it might not be a problem Otherwise the shoe fits fine which is why this is such a frustrating problem

Went a half size down on this shoe Not the greatest design and R2have a larger base sole that R1giving it more of a chunky look

Very comfortable fit well and would purchase an Adidas shoe again

Great look with comfort Super light Ixe2 x9d xa4 xef xb8 x8f running shoes These are a must have I have a fat wide foot so with that in mind I always have to get a size bigger Which I did and they fit perfect

My son who is VERY picky about shoes He only wears shoes that are extremely comfortable I am glad that I found him these I read one of the online reviews says always buy 1 2 size down for Adidas shoes so I did and it worked great

Becuse it was irritating my skin behind the heel not only that The sneaker makes a weird noise

they are really stylish and comfy i love them as they match with anything

I love these shoes super comfortable to workout and run in

Super comfortable and easy to wear Looking to buy in other colors

The mesh upper hugs my foot very nicely and the boost is very bouncy as expected The EVA plug can be felt on the inside of the feet but are not really bothersome Nice shoe

They look very good and they are extremely comfortable as well Great buy

Affordable shoe comfortable decent looks These shoes are worth your money I wish the green text would be white though but in overall the shoes are great

They are great good quality exactly what I ordered and fit well Although the boost outsole is a little hard to clean but other than that they are amazing

First pair for me and I like the product overall I look forward to purchasing more in the near future

The Adidas NMD R2 are Comfortable Affordable Stylish I would definitely recommend to anyone

This shoe is definitely one of my best footwear purchases Its comfort and quality make are superior to all the other shoes I have worn and not to mention that it compliments all my casual outfits nicely Since I am wide footed the block on the side did take a little bit of time to get used to but this problem went away after a few wears

The soles are very comfortable and great for wearing all day

I really like the look of this sneaker plus I was waiting and watching for the price to go down Adidas has great saleson its merchandise I love Adidas

I have been a Sneakerhead since I was a kid In my opinion this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn This pair is 1 of 4 that I have gotten in different colors can not have too much of a good thing right

Excellent for me the best Oooooooooooooooooooooooo

It feels very good around my whole foot it looks good also if you wear white or red in my opinion

I bought the first all white pair of NMD and fell in love The second is just as good and fits my foot perfectly I have a wide foot so I always order a half size up

I thought this shoe is affordable and yet comfortable

I like the style and design but something is missing

This is one of my favorite pairs of boosts They have the best hybrid of comfort and looks They do not do great with water because of the materials so I usually do not wear them when its raining but still one of my favorites

Very good as always comfort style looks quality

The arch support hurts the Adidas logo was part peeled upon arrival

I am very happy with these running shoes they are very light and have fantastic cushioning The material and design of the upper shoe means that it fits firmly around the foot too The best running shoe I have had in years

Excellent shoes So comfortable go half size up if you like a loose fit Like walking on a mattress

Comfortable and casual shoe for everyday use Clean and stylish looking shoe

very comfortable and easy to put on

I bought this shoe in US It is very comfortable and great to wear

Nice quality shoes but I find it a little narrow with the EVA midsole block edging into the feet which makes it uncomfortable

Very comfy and light Also a nice looking shoe but casualthe same time

Great quality and design Perfect fit and good look you can dress it up or use it for working out can not go wrong with NMDs

Most comfortable shoes ever and look so clean Easy way to add a new facet to your shoe game

The boost is very comfortable and i heard a lot of people complain about the block on the side but you cannot even tell it is there

I love to wear them everyday and for the most part the quality holds up The black upper is great because it does not show dirt Very comfortable

Good equality and good looking I love everything about it and it is so comfortable and gorgeous I love NMD and adidas so much This is the bestt

The blocks on the inside of the sole make the shoes out of the box so uncomfortable to stand in I am still working on breaking these shoes in

First NMD purchase and well worth it Hype aside it is a great all around shoe Very comfortable to wear all day and stylish People will definitely notice this shoe

Love the quality and the price Adidas NMD R2 is one of my favorite shoes

Got these last week True to size and really comfortable

These look great and are super comfortable Love them and am really happy I purchased them

Really light and comfortable i like that the design and color khaki is not too loud crazy Just be sure to get half a size bigger 4 stars on the quality cause have not had them for long yet Materials and fit and finish look great though

The boost is great my only complaint would be the inside of the shoe and how big the tab is it digs into my foot a little bit but other that that it is a great shoe

Amazing sneakers love them the boost is super comfortable

Got it on sale so was perfect for price I paid just hard to keep clean

Great shoe that is very comfortable Would definitely buy again

Tried on one shoe and it felt as if the tab on the side was digging into the side of my foot did not bother trying on the other and left it alone for a week Yeezy 350came in which were great and finally tried the NMDs on after Not sure what it was I was feeling before but I no longer felt the tab and if anything they feel more comfortable than the yeezys

All NMDs kinda fit the same I have not worn these yet so take this with a grain of salt but dam do NMDs fit nice These thangs look good

The only down side of these shoes is they get dirty easy so keep shoe cleaner on hand

The shoe looks really good and feel great and the size fit perfect

Comfortable and reasonably priced Husband loves them

This is the 2nd pair of NMDs I bought for my daughter She loves how cool this pair of shoes look on her Very comfortable and stylish

the shoes are really nice a Little bit narrow but the design is really cool happy with my purchase

Shoes are comfy and look great Can dress them up or take them for a casual stroll

This are some legit snickers I like them you need to keep them clean though

Not what I expected do not like them when I get out the hospital I plan on returning them

Price was great

shoe are comfortable and has a cool pattern from top to side panel

The back heel part of the shoe really rubs up against the back of my ankle heel but only on my right shoe shows the quality control of the shoe bc in my epic ultraboost epic reacts or vapormaxes I have no problem

walking for extended periods of time is effortless

NMDs are an amazing show in any variation Style and comfort you can not beat

I have bought enough pairs to last for years since I do not feel like wearing anything else anymore I do not care too much about how they look but I do not care because of the otherworldly comfort They are the ultimate in comfort True game changers

Fit as expected went 1 2 size up because I have a wide foot Look great and are very comfotable

The colorway is great and the shoes are comfy Boost is Life

Dirty bottoms these shoes looked used and returned

I was skeptical of the Boost technology No longer These feel like walking on clouds and the hype is real I also love the design Super casual and modern Perfect for walking One thing to noteI do not like the tongue It folds every time i put my foot in it constantly forcing me to adjust the tongue Otherwise this is a perfect shoe

Great shoe from size to design The only comment is that the inside foam had nail marks from someone gripping poorly I just expected it to be in mint condition buying new Would buy shoe again love the adidas nmd brand

Very comfortable Overall great quality shoe The boost in the shoe changed the game with the comfort and durablity

Probably the most comfortable shoes I have bought I usually get a half size smaller for shoes like this

The NMD is essentially the child of the Stan Smith and Ultraboost it is a crude weird analogy I know but it works The Originals inspiration is clear in the heel tab design and the cosmetics making sure everybody knows that Adidas is the brand with the three stripes Furthermore in typical Adi fashion you have the three stripes on the sides The Ultraboost inspiration comes in with the technology and overall silhouette of the shoe You definitely get running shoe vibes when you wear the NMDs some people use the NMDs for running Then Adi tacks on the Boost technology to cap off the NMDs as a coming together of the old and the new A genuine piece of shoe art from Adidas

The quality is fantastic the boost feels a lot better than the NMD R1 the white color is crisp and clean Go half a size bigger

Shoe feels comfortable Very stylish and eye catching

The color comfort quality and have been a patron of Adidas for 4 decades

Love the sneakers Look and feel great Awesome color

This item is perfect I like it very much and I recommend it

I do not like it because it is uncomfortable on the heel and sole they need a better sole like ultra boosts

Much bounce give Grog the less back pain after woman make Grog walk around Disney 4 days Grog like feel better sometime

The R2 is far more comfy to the R1 but compared to the ultra boost or the Dthey feel a little cheap

Very comfortable shoes they just run a bit long and the pod on the side takes some getting used to as with other nmds

It was on sale and in my size Within my parents price range

Best shoes I have owned Will definitely buys Adidas shoes

Looks amazing and feels amazing no complaints and loving the Miami dolphin colors that goes with it

The color matching is designed very well I like it at all

Like the product for the comfort and price I had really been wanting to try the boost

This product is something I wanted for awhile and now that I have it I love them

Comfortable and so far holding up well can not go wrong with he orange either

Good product comfortable good fit for the price good

Excellent colorway snug fit Walked around for 10 hours plus in these and they were great it is no Ultra Boost but a great shoe at the price I would recommend this to someone

I was very skeptical after reading all the reviews I took a chance and i was not dissapointed Very comfortable shoes and that thing on the side You do not even feel it Buy them you will not regret it

One of the most comfortable shoes I own Great color

The boost pod was a little uncomfortable at first because of my wide feet but I wear inserts so everything was fine

The foot bed is super comfortable and I love them so much

This product is comfortable and is exactly what I have been looking for My first pair of adidas in a while I think I am coming back

Consider a half size down down before purchasing that would be the only CON I can see of the product I can not think of anything else other than great

Very stylin shoes Very comfortable Good fit The little cut outs in the inside of the sole feel a little strange but not too bad They pick up dirt like a magnet Have to be very careful to avoid making them super dirty and shabby too quickly

These are super comfy They are well made Breathable material My main attraction is the funky colors and the comfort Highly recommend for anyone walking or standing for prolong times

IT WAS VERY SENSATION TO ME IT WAS SO COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT NO PAIN FOR MY FOOT AND I PURCHASED ENERGY BOOST HARDEN 1 I BOUGHT MANY BOOST CUSHION SHOES MORE AFTER THIS SHOES PURCHASE I WANT TO RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE JUST TRIED YOU WILL LOVE IT

This product is great for every day wearing and I will purchase more in the near future

So the R2 has a bigger size back of boost on the shoe than the R1 Me personally if you have a wide foot and want to own nmd this model is for you I have narrow feet so when I put these on the boost bar is uncomfortable for me

I like the color scheme and comfort The design and quality of materials are superior

These are great shoes Super comfortable and very light weight They are very breathable and keep you feet cool on warm days

The color scheme is awesome plus the BOOST technology Adidas adds just takes it to the next level of comfort Very light shoe that feels like a sock sometimes LOVE nmd

Definitely looks 10x better in person I was shocked actually

The breathable comfortable summer time stylish shoe Great purchase

Comfortable and slick shoes Got a lot of compliments from them

Great fit and super comfortable Bought these for my 14 year old son for back to school shoes All he will wear is Adidas

Light and comfortable plus I got praises for the style

Fit is great Comfortable Color is perfect Nice shoe

They really comfortable Has nice colors and they are really beautiful

Really good product Super comfortable they look great

Shoes were popular and good deal I am not sure if I am supposed to wear socks with these shoes

This colorway is amazing especially for the summer I get compliments everywhere I go not to mention where to purchase these exact sneakers

Its a great pair of shoes but the fit is a little weird

I have a ton of shoes maybe over 100 and this one is not my favorite because first they get very dirty easy and are very hot If I were to recommend a boost shoe it would be the eqt

Color was spot on the price is affordable and the comfortability of the shoe is excellent

Those bits on the sides stick up and stick my foot Very uncomfortable really disappointing I am joining the chorus of reviewers telling you about this problem Avoid

Comfortable stylish and did I mention comfortable

I recommend the product only at the price point less than 60 bucks

feet I would go with a half size up

This a Great Summer Sneaker Definitely one of my favorites

First R2and I am just as into them as my R1Salmon and Aqua colorway is awesome for summer Only concern is durability i have worn holes fairly quickly in my R1especially the Primeknits

I love they look but the support stabilizer presses against your feet and makes it uncomfortable unfortunately

This is like my 10th pair and have not bought any shoe other than NMDsince

Ordered for my son and he LOVES them Exactly what we were expecting and more

Overall good quality If you size 7 then buy size 5 5

According to my son who has worn a different brand of shoes his whole life these shoes are so much better then my other shoes like walking on pillows 

The NMD R2 summer shoe is a great shoe it is comfort will last all day

i had to get these half a size down like my nmd r1s but these are perfect i love them they are the right fit super comfy and look super cool

When I first got it it was slightly too big so I had to exchange it The first few days of wearing it was a bit uncomfortable because of the brick on the inside but after a few days I got used to it and it got pretty comfortable

Amazing purchase Best price ever great quality very comfortable great look Really happy

They are really comfortable according to my boyfriend They run a little a big so I would suggest a 1 2 size smaller

The shoe has great cushioning and the outlast technolgy provides a great filter of the heat Although the block on the side is irritating sometimes

The colors definitely say summer time Boost is always comfy Shoe runs a little long so I would recommend going half size down

abnormally large arches inside the shoe and the sole material is honeycomb which is a bit uncomfortable to stand on for awhile

there is nothing I can say bad about it It was exactly what I was looking for Perfect fit

This shoe meets my expectations It is comfortable good for Training and Running And lastly they look stylish as well

very well made really comfortable Price was great

The MND R2 Summer shoe is very lightweight it is good for jogging and running The price is affordable

These shoes look even better on feet The maroon colorway with gum sole go so well together Very nice shoe even tho it is not PK Sizing is same as all boosts Great shoe Even better price

Bought them for my fiancee and he says they are very comfortable We purchased the red AND grey ones

Comfortable shoe Looks great Love the cushioning 13 ran too small and 14 ran too big Also there is a seam on the inside sole that stick out and rubs against my arch Annoying but just need to get used to it I guess

Pros firstGreat color combinations that are vibrant yet mellow pastels I got both and did some lace changing These shoes look fantastic Now the negativesThe achilles heel counter digs into the flesh so you can not really wear no show socks at the beginning The shoe whilst looking fantastic has a terrible overall design The lack of insoles is not comfortable due to the small circular cutouts in the sockliner you feel them through thin socks The shoe has terrible heel to toe transition while walkinglike walking on paddles Lastly these run hot in a bad way not breezy at all The colors are for spring summer but might be best worn in fall winter

I love the quality and perfectness They are one of my favorite shoes

Love them So comfortable and stylish Love the reflecting laces very nice touch

I really liked these shoes but since they are out of stock I can not reorder or replace them I am going to have to return these unfortunately Wish this did not happen

I am a size 14 in every shoe brand I have ever owned for 10 years this shoe was at least a size 15 if not bigger They really should confirm to the exact way everyone else measures shoe sizes

These shoes would be and should be very comfortable except someone thought it a good idea to have a hard rubber piece dig into your arch Why have the soft fancy exterior just to have this hard rubber piece digging in the arch and serving no purposeUnfortunately will have to send these back

Breathable shoe that feels as if I am just wearing socks

I liked these shoes enough to actually write a review about them Walked 10 miles in these shoes and my feet were not sore

I love these kicks Solid style and quite comfy One note I have flat feet and these have a slight arch I initially felt the arch on my feet but it subsided

The comfort is outstanding I can understand those who complain about the block digging into the arch but for me it is perfectly placed to provide a bit of arch support and I have a low arch The Boost midsole is bouncy and supportive This color is summery The shoe has a beautiful simple silhouette

I went through 2 pairs of these The first one was uncomfortable because of the rubber rectangle on the inside of the foot was constantly digging into me I had to walk on the outside edge of my feet So I sent those back and went up a size At least the return was easy enough Then the bigger size came in and I have the same issue I thought the extra room would help but that relief was never found Maybe I am the only one that can not wear these because of that piece but it is so uncomfortable my shoes have not been worn more than 5 times They have been boxed up for over a month now I should have sent them back too but had to go out of state for work for a bit and missed the return window

great shoe every body is telling me they are nice tennis shoes

When wearing no shows the tongue pinches the skin a little bit but over the shoe is fine

Love the fit and comfort level and the design is perfect

Adidas are reasonably priced with style would not choose any other brand

Not the most comfortable shoe No insoles is weird Gets dirty easy they do get a lot of compliments though

This was my first pair of NMDand I am happy with how they perform I typically go to the gym 4 times a week and I wanted shoes that would not squeak with every step I took like my Nikes did I was happily surprised with how much support these shoes provide Coming from someone who previously sprained both ankles support is extremely important Although I do have to wear socks that cover more on my ankle because the shoe is pretty tall but other than that I am happy I bought these especially on sale I will definitely be purchasing more

I bought these because I also have a pair on ultraboost and these are just as comfy as those the tongue of the shoe sticks out too much in my opinion which is my only complaint

At first it was a bit tight width wise but it got better after a while

They are comfortable and are a good purchase for anyone looking to buy adidas shoes

Weigh nothing Breatheable Great for hot summer weather

Comfortable shoe feels good on my feet will probably buy another pair soon

Love the color scheme Fins Up Great fit great product

These are my 1st pair of NMDAs expected they are comfortable with the Boost tech and they look great They are unique in how they feel on my feet too The heel is well cushioned whereas the cushioning is less pronounced in the ball of my foot I have not figured out yet if it is just because I am spoiled by my Ultra Boost and eQT cushioning under the balls of my feet or not but there is a difference albeit not entirely bad either I understand that there must be different fits and comfort spectrums across the sneaker lineup since none of us are the same Overall a very good sneaker and I would purchase another pair

Super comfortable and look really cool as well Kinda want to buy more

Comfortable and stylish One of the best shoes I have owned

I have pretty messed up feet due to breaking my right one twice and both big toes several times I run a lot and I work out for several hours a day for work dog walker and I was resigned to the idea that I was gonna be stuck wearing ugly clown shoes for horribly painful feet forever These are super comfortable and finally I can wear shoes I think look good it is totally a vanity thing but it is the truth I have several pairs of NMD shoes since I started wearing them only this February and I wish I started wearing them earlier

Comfortable and good looking shoe Had to buy a half size smaller

they are very light perfect fit and very comfortable

the boost makes the shoe so comfortable that i could wear it for days the size fits nice and looks amazing

Great shoe that is very comfy to wear Unfortunately It felt too narrow for my somewhat wide feet so I recommend sizing maybe 1 2 up NMD R1s fit me just fine so I figured I would go true to size with the R2s but I was wrong

Very comfortable and super light Only issue is the back of the shoe has a weird angle and sometimes grabs things behind you or grips the floor and sticks

I like the colors they play together well the mesh is nice Just have a issue with lack of insole because sometimes some pairs i bought inikis or nmds i can feel the stitching up front with my big toe Some pairs no issue some pairs i feel the thread that connects the shoe to insole and my toe keeps feeeling the stitches annoying But if ur pair or foot does not have the issue there is no issue

Most comfortable shoes I have ever bought Definitely need to buy some kind of protection spray like Crep to keep the solid white clean

great looking shoe and nice boost soles but super uncomfortable in the foot arch area due to stiffer piece around foot arch very noticeable discomfort when walking i have slight arch in my foot this shoe might be for a flat footed individual

Adidas steady killin it These shoes look DOPE They hella comfortable for long walks and look amazing with jeans or shorts Fit is amazing Most comfortable shoe I have had in I can not remember how long can not believe I have not copped NMDs yet but now I know I will be buying these forever

YES THEY WERE VERY NICE i WOULD SO BUY ANOTHER PAIR

Really good price for a good quality sneaker might buy again if there is more sales

They are nice and fairly inexpensive They provide great comfort

Size was 1 2 too big but it looks awesome and stylish Also comfortable but I thought there would be more support and there is not Worth it

I have flat feet so it is not too comfortable with me

it is a nice shoe comfort is decent however the block on the inner part of the shoes is more noticeable than NMD R1s in my experience

that brick is unnecessary not comfortable in the arch

They look great like the colors I bought these to run in thought they would be comfortable cuz of the boost foam but because of the plug or rectangle on the inner outside of the shoe it feels like a jagged rock is in my shoe If your looking for comfortable shoes it is not this one If your looking for style you all end up paying with more than just money with these

I like the product when it reduce the impact on my knees but I would like to ask for waterproof on the front part of the shoe only if it is possible Thank you

The comfort and style are amazing Neutral color so they match with everything

I have more then one they are very comfy love the style

I love these shoes because They go with anything and just on good they look especially Since therewhites

These sneakers are really comfortable They fit perfectly and I will definitely purchase another pair

These shoes are extremely comfortable and stylish

they are slightly uncomfortable when you first step into them but after you have been out and walking for some time there comfortable

Shoes are very comfortable and they fit with practically any outfit They are stylish run true to size and are great for narrow to normal feet If you are thinking about buying these give them a shot cause you will most likely like them

comfort over style but this also looks dope in any style

The sizing was a touch too big I am a size 12 in Nike size 12 5 in Adidas and size 13 in New Balance and I am going to need a size 12 in these shoes after trying the 12 5 out

I have been looking for a pair of sneakers to wear this summer I have tried on many shoes and I ended up picking the Nmd R2 

Great purchase Really comfy and look good Stay true to size

I normally wear a womans 8 5 got a mens 7 and the shoe is probably one of the most comfortable shoes I have Can be in them all day Highly recommend

My 10 year old picked this out for me and the ahoes do not disappoint Good looking durable and comfortable

Really like the NMD shoes They are very comfortable shoes

The little block on the exterior of the shoe on the inside of the feet digs into the arches of my feet and makes my arches hurt

sleek and comfortable with a very supportive sole

These are probably the most comfortable Adidas I have purchased and I have received lots of complements on how stylish they look Perfect sneakers for this summer season

Awsome pruduct every one should have a pair they were comfortable they were light and they were breathable the only thing i would have liked is if they were a little wider because my footbis just so wide but other than that they are awsome and i wear them every day

I got these shoes to look good for casual wear and to last for college

Great fit love the colors and very comfortable I will definitely be buying more nmd

great shoe for the price super comfortable and sylish

I got these as a birthday present for my boyfriend and he loved them

Got these for my 15 yr old grandson He said he loves the shoes The size 12 fits great with a little room to grow into Very lightweight no issues with the footbed or soles

My grandson was very happy to receive this pair of shoes for his birthday His choice

I got two pairs while on vacation getting my typical size but when I got home and wore one pair in a bit it was obvious that they were meant for smaller feet Wish there was something I could do with my second pair now

It looks very nice It was at an affordable prize

I like the quality of the sneaker because it feels quite sturdy and because i walk alot it gives me perfect comfort

Go half a size up from your true to size I bought my true size and they ripped after 6 months of wear I bought a half size up and they fit perfectly and do not rip The boost is also much more comfortable than R1

The stitching just isnt what I expected it holds but it is not as clean as I would have liked

it goes with everything and is so comfy i love it 

Comfort comfort and stylish My 14 year old son loves these shoes He says he feels he is walking on air

These shoes are awesome glad I bought them Buy them you will not regret it

I am wearing right now as I write this review Very comfortable and light shoes Maybe even comfortable than my a16 ultraboost that I love Try them you will thank me later

it is comfortable it is comfortable it is comfortable it is comfortable

My son was going to an Anime Convention and needed a comfortable shoe for walking Surprised him with these and he LOVED them He asked for another pair

I purchased three sizes and none of them were right size

I loved this shoe I have never tried on Adidas and I was expecting fitment problems They fit perfectly and looked mad dope The quality feels superior to what I am accustomed to My favorite part of the shoe is the mix matching lettering on the back end strap

The shoes are great They look awesome and they are super comfortable Only negative I have is that the laces are a little stiff feeling

Color way is sick Looks fresh on anyones feet Super comftorable and breathable Easily best shoes ive gotten in a long time

They are very comfortable and lightweight Even though I have only had them for 2 weeks I feel confident that they will last The material is perfect for hot summers as you feel every bit of wind through them Be careful not to wear them when it is raining you will get wet immediately

Really great shoes only thing that could be better is that the white rubber is made out of a material that gets super dirty and is hard to clean These shoes are gonna get dirty quick

Love them Getting lots of compliments can not wait to put them on again

The knit on these summer shoes is very nice And the out last liner is also nice love the nubuck on the heel tab excellent shoe by Adidas once again

Comfortable just did not like how I get the stitching in the edges around my foot

The shoe is pretty narrow and the box on the instepnrises above the midsole and creates pressure on your foot it is a shame because the shoe is very comfortable otherwise I had to return them because the box hurt my foot after 30 minutes of wear

They are very comfortable wherever and whenever you wear them I like that they have a tongue on the top of the shoe so that you can adjust the feeling of the shoe The ultraboost on the sole of the shoe makes it feel so comfortable to wear It feels like I am walking on a trampoline or a cloud when I wear them

I have one and love it So I ordered for my brother He loves it

Firs the shoe looks amazing on but the arch support areas poke into my feet Its bizarre as never had issue with NMDCannot wear the shoe as it feels like something is digging into arch every stride Returning sadly

First off I am a big fan of Adidas I own a pair of the Ultra Boost and love them The NMD R2 though uses the boost cushioning does not provide the same cushioning as the Ultra Boost The heel has much less of a cushioned feel I literally wore the shoes once and have put them in storage They are great looking shoes Fire But the cushioning is awful The other thing is the outer sole come so far back behind the heel that it affects how you walk You have to pick your feet up a little higher than normal if you do not want a premature heel strike I am assuming that for runners who strike on their forefoot this is not a problem But for people who wear them casually to walk and look fashionable these shoes are terrible to walk in I actually feel bad for people who buy these shoes without ever buying the real Ultra Boost the NMD R2 is a very poor representation of what the boost tech can do simply because the functional design of the shoe is horrendous Again the shoes are fire They look great I have the all white ones and I have stored them away and they look pristine Please Adidas form follows function The NMD R2 is an example of what happens when function follows form Please test them beyond a sketch

very confortable I love them the color the fabric is too soft

I love the nmd because it can fit all dress codes

Came in the mail in a reasonable amount of time and the colors suits the name perfectly Instant cop

I love Nmd R2 very comfortable in my feet Great shoes Nice design

I have not bought this product I just like touching stars

Great looking shoe and very comfortable I would recommend to others

They are supper comfy I wear them everyday I have a lot of shoes and these are definitely the best I have so far

I typically like Nike but I bought my first pair of Adidas and fine them a lot more comfortable Will definitely buy again

they are very white Great summer shoe

My 11 year old son loves the NMD R2 out of all his sneakers and he has many He says they are the most comfortable shoe he has ever had We just ordered two pairs for my husband birthday

Great for walking while you are at the supermarket

I have multiple pairs of NMDthey are easily my new favorite show Extremely comfortable

Comfortable shoe Only issue is the shoe gets dirty really easy

I love the color how they look and feel These are my second shoes that I have bought of the same size

Good looking shoes for sure but that hard plastic under my arch makes no sense at all and kills my foot I ordered to different NMDand both were the same Fail Fail

The look of these shoes are amazing they are really comfortable

Only small criticism is it may be a 1 2 size too large depending on your foot but other than that perfect product can not beat the amazing comfort and quality for 120

Absolutely love these shoes By far the comfiest shoes I have ever purchased I will always go with adidas from now on

Stylish but i do not like how toes are shown The material around the toes are breathable but shows my toes through the material I bought a size larger and i still have this issue

If they had them in a wide they would be clutch but over all they are the most comfortable shoes ever and I am usually a Nike person but I believe I just made the switch over

Amazing everything was perfect The employees found my perfect size

Fit great great looking excellent cushioning for everyday wear

Awesome shoe love everything about it it is very comfortable and light

yes i would recommend this because it is comfortable

I love NMDs in general but the picture does it no justice Way better in person They are extremely comfortable and beautiful Love my new shoes Worth every dollar

I am a fan of all NMDs this was my first pair of C2s They are light and comfortable The colorway is awesome I am glad I was able to find my size in this one

Best shoes ever The shoes are soft comfortable and nicely made

The shoe is super stylish and pretty comfortable

Nice looking shoes comfortable nice color combinations

Looks great and super comfy Love it Would definitely buy more NMD

Has a good look and wears easily Many colors and looks to choose from

This is the best and most comfortable shoe I have worn in my 16 5 years of living The material is durable comfortable and high quality while the boost feels amazing and solid on these shoes so amazing that I had to cop 2 pairs They also literally work great with any outfit The dream shoe

Ultra boost are superior to almost any foot tech on the market They are like a cloud the khaki color is clean and can be worn with almost any outfit I recommend sticking with black white and brown but to each his her own I will always be a fan of the boost teach and especially thr incredible breath ability of the R1

Comfortable and stylish it is so bouncy when you run you feel like you are about to be launched to the moon Would definitely purchase this item again

The shoes are very comfortable and it looks really nice The boost feels like you are walking in clouds and after using Nike Puma and Under Armour I must say that this is the best shoes I have ever own Adidas is making a comeback and I am loving it

Cause it is very comfortable and looks nice when you wear it

If there is one more little band attached to the side that is more similar to NMd would be awesome

they are pretty confortable fit very well on the foot

These were my first pair of NMDs and they did not disappoint Might even get another pair one day

Bought 4 different pairs and all were too narrow Had to return them all

Great shoe overall They fit pretty well and were pretty much well described My only complaints are that they are a little thin on the bottom When I am running on a rough surface I can definitely feel it through the shoe do not recommend for running in Also on the inside side of the shoe is a little box that sticks out a little this also sticks a little into the shoe as well and was a little uncomfortable while breaking them in

I love my shoes They are super white So I have to be careful but that is why I love them so much

I do love these ones the originals gave me a pinch these are great though

I had to have these shoes so I bought them an entire size smaller And despite the size the shoe is still comfortable and so cute The quality is ins

Feels like you are walking on Marshmellows I look forward to wearing them

I love the comfort but no so much the mesh material really thin

I love the amount of support these shoes have and how light they are Will definitely be buying another pair at some point

Product came in a broken and dented box The shoes were slightly creased on one shoe However shoe itself is satisfactory for price listed

Super comfortable casual look matching any type of clothes

I bought these back in Febuary best descion ever They not only look great but they feel great I would totally recommend these shoes to everyone Great Job Adidas keep it up

These shoes have great arch support and are comfortable for an everyday shoe

This is my first Adidas shoe ever and it is one of the most comfortable shoe i have ever own Would by many more in the future if i could

My first set of adidas workout shoes and I love them

Comfortable and light weight wear them all the time great shoes

The shoes are very comfortable and the color is very cute Looking forward to my next nmd purchase

Bought for my husband birthday extremely comfortable His new daily shoes

Comfortable shoe and reasonable price too many characters to write in this section defeats the purpose of wanting to write a review

Tongue too weird Have to adjust it as I put the shoe on Fit was good But not as comfy as I hoped

Overall the Shoes look great and very comfortable when walking BUT when I walked in these the black piece on the medial side of the shoes dug into my arch posterior heels I would recommend to eliminate that piece all together to improve the shoes comfort

The product is great for casual wear but also looks nicer than an average athletic shoe I want to get my husband more colors to add more variety

East slip on and comfortable Easy to match Get dirty easy

The shoe looks great They do run true to size so I should have got a larger shoe but it is great

Comfortable shoes but after wearing they fall apart Bad quality overall Foam comes off the side

They run small I am a 13 and needed to get a size 14 Quality is good and the shoe is insanely comfortable The white will get dirty really fast But that is expected with an all white shoe

I love the minimalist monochrome look of the grey color Goes great with black jeans or dark colored joggers My only complaint is that the boost around the heel is a little large and would like them slightly more if that was slimmed back a bit Also they are insanely comfortable

My grandson picked these out I ordered them for his birthday The process was easy the shoes were amazing

They look great they fit perfectly what more could you want

I absolutely loved these shoes They were super comfortable and stylish Unfortunately I could only wear them for one day because they got stolen on the very same day I got them Welp there went all the money from my first paycheck

I love the product because is super comfortable and can blen with any outfit

It is definitely worth the money They are sooooooo comfortable

I am afraid to get them dirty They look so nice Thanks Adidas

Garbage poor quality for the price do not buy a waste of money

I only wear designer sneakers for my athleisure look For a fraction of the price and a lot more Comfor they are brilliant Lots of look wore them with the joggers and a sweater found my new sneaker

This shoe is so light and comfortable and I love the color I have received many compliments

Love the color Very comfortable Wish they had these earth tone colors in women sizes and not just pink and turquoise

Stylish shoe good looking perfect fit and they made my husband look taller it is a plus

I really like the comfort and style of the sneaker It is my first pair of nmd and I would definitely buy again

I purchased these shoes because my son recommended them Initially they felt okay and I bought them but after few walks I noticed it was very tight in the middle and not very comfortable as it was squeezing my foot in the middle too hard because that is how this shoe was made other than that they look pretty good and that is about it

Bag the rainy ones

NMD is my go to shoe for looking good without trying too hard Super clean modern looks cloud like cushion and long wearing stretch upper

I like this product because it is my first adidas product and it impressed me with its comfort ability look and durability I have been wearing them since I got them and they still look clean and brand new Five stars Adidas

I like those tennis cus is very comfortable the best quality this is a very nice shoes I love adidas

I love them I am buying more of them I am really am happy with this purchase

So I suffer from lower back issues and I needed something that feels like walking on clouds These are definitely it I may have to buy a couple more pairs just to have spares

I try to avoid writing reviews and using hyperbole when I do but these shoes are awesome They look great they feel great and I hope they last me a long long time I like them enough I am debating getting a second pair for when these wear out

Looks great and feels great easy on and easy off

Awesome feel except for the block on the side is felt through the shoe I have wider feet so this may be due to that

I liked these but they feel a little bulky and stain easier than you would think

it is a beautiful shoethere is no denying that It looks good with any slim skinny fit pants or shorts it is comfortable enough to walk around in but I would not use it for jogging or sports The inner sole feels like it is going to wear out quicker than not

The style is one of my favorites and I am always getting complimented on them The shoes are fairly comfortable but if you are wearing them with no show sock they are not quite as comfortable also if you have a wide foot they may seem like they fit weird in the front of the shoe There are a few other things that were not as comfortable as I was hoping but overall they are nice shoes and I would probably buy another pair

Perfect color and quality Left pair is a bit uncomfortable from the inner side

Like walking on a cloud Good running shoes too Just gotta see how long they last

this is mad comfort and it has a great quality and looked icey so my brother decided to get him a pair

The shoes were very comfortable and fit pretty well The vapour grey color is super clean and looks great

This was my first pair of NMDand I already want another I wear it for almost any situation It is by far my favorite shoe it is a great blend of fashion and comfort highly recommend this shoe

My sin was complaining of pain in his heel Bought him these sneakers for more support He has not complained since

Best shoe I ever got Boost cushioning is very comfortable bouncy and responsive Looks great too Definitely get this shoe

I do not like this because not comfortable when I walk They hurt my feet

My shoe came with a small scuff mark other than that Perfect

The square plate on the side can be uncomfortable if you have wide feet Other than that they are super comfy

I would give the product 5 stars but I have not yet worn them for at least a full day to really give it a full review but so far they seem promising

The shoes are very comfortable and light great job Adidas

I ordered a 10 1 2 because that is what my ofther adidas shoes are and they are awesome But these fit bigger and that causes a bump in the shoe when laced up

The break in progress prevent it from being a 5 The Eva in the shoe is hard but after 3 days it is like it never existed I will be buying more and ultra boost

I really love the aesthetic of this shoe I hope it is durable

The medial block digs into the arch of the foot Returned and bought EQT Support boost instead Those EQTs Heaven is missing some clouds cuz Adidas used those clouds on the EQTsgreat for those like me who need a better arch support

The rectangular piece at the side of the shoe dug into the arch of my foot making them quite painful to wear Unfortunate since I was looking forward to owning my first pair of NMDs so I am incredibly disappointed

it is like walking on a cloud and the shoe fits true to size They also go with a lot of things

Absolutely love my nmd this is my 4th pair and could not be happier I will definitely keep buying them

THE shoe is comfy and has a cool design and can be used for any casual occasion

They are nice not as good looking as the pic but good

When i first ordered these nmdthere was not any reviews and to get my size i just measured my foot like how it was recommended on the website if you want to have very nice fit and little bit of toe room when you measure your foot go too the size that it is closer too like I am a size 9 5 and i could not tell if my foot was 10 4 or 10 5 inches so picked 10 5 so I took 10 5 and the size is very nice i do not have wide feet and i have nice to room but if you want a really exact fit then pick the smaller size the only bad part is the medial plug you can feel it but it is not an issue for me after like 2 uses you do not feel it any more but it is still a good comfy pair of sneakers it does not really run big in my personal opinion

I usually do not write reviews for anything ever but man these shoes are amazing I actually got my first pair stolen at the packaging area which was such a bummer But I decided this time to get one for me and the black ones for my bf They are not only cute and stylish but also comfortable Finding shoes that are comfortable for me is pretty hard because my big toes are curled up but this one gives flexible room for my toes They are light weight and I would DEF buy them again Contemplating if I should get one more hehe If you are on the verge i HIGHLY recommend

I overall really like this shoes but the knitting is starrring to come in done from the cage Also the boost just is not there there is also 0 cushoning on the toe

They are the perfect size and are the most comfortable shoes

Awesome product and extremely light weight and comfortable

Crazy comfortable looks super nice and I would say no complaints but I have two The boost gets dirty really fast and it ruins the asthetic but it is an easy fix with washing in hot water or using a whitener Another complaint is they were a tiny fraction too small but almost unnoticable If you keep good care of them they will last a long time

I purchased these thinking they may be uncomfortable After I received them and wore them for a couple days These are the most comfortable shoes I have owned

These shoes are so perfect So comfortable and fashionable Compliments every where I go I need to get every color Love these shoes soooo much

I get the hype now Walking in these shoes makes it feel like the ground is made of play doh I can run errands all day in these shoes and it feels so good to walk around in these after a hard run

first at all i saw the coral color star to like them and when i got them i felt in love with my tennis shoes they are comfy perfect wide perfect size awesome color quality

The shoes were great but the stripes scratch easily and when dirt gets on boost it never comes off

Most comfortable shoes They are stable too with lots of cushion

It is comfortable stylish and for a great price

EVERYTHING IS GOOD ABOUT THIS SHOES GOOD GOOD GOOD MAKE ME SOME ON RED PLEASE

This one is much better than the other one I bought I liked it

The shoe is comfertable and good looking just the boost get dirty very easily and is hard to get dirt out of

Ordered for my son He loved them My daughter owns a pair also ordered online through adidas com she even bought a pair for her boyfriend I am definitely considering getting me a pair Shoe looks nice comfortable and see myself as a return customer Thanks adidas

I am a girl and I bought these shoes and I am obsessed with them The only reason why I did not give it Five Stars is bechase the sizing is off I ordered my regular size in men shoes a six and my toes were literally sticking out of the shoe My feet were aching so much after I wore them for one whole day and the arch of my foot was killing me because I was trying not to ruin the shoe The shoes are so cute the material is sturdy but light and it makes you look taller It was a good purchase overall it just needed some sizing warnings

These are super comfortable and the style is perfect I am a woman but they are perfect for either gender

Hands down my best shoes to date I would buy one again

I own a pair of NMDs and bought these for my boyfriendafter wearing them an entire weekend he loves them They look sleek especially with the added gumsole which allows him to dress it up if he wants to They are also super comfortable Best investment Highly recommend

The rectangle plastic piece on the outside of the shoes hits your foot in an uncomfortable way

ultra comfysuper stylishgreat looking and great to wear all day

Look incredible feel incredible and look good with anything Would recommend to anyone but I like being the only dude rocking these

See title Shoes are great length but the shoe itself is very narrow

Overall really really great It has good comfort too

Most comfortable thing ever Love this shoe My previous shoes always made my heel hurt when I wear these I feel no pain at all Would buy again Looks great performs well love this shoe

The shoe is very bright and profound When wearing the shoe the fit is perfect and snug but also lets your foot breath with comfort and delight I am very happy with my purchase The gum sole is not as white as the shoe and is very easy to clean and does not dirty easy I really reccomend this shoe and please for the love of god add this to your collection

I have lots of NMDs but these are my go to They match with everything and go with just about anything Love these shoes

I liked the shoes when I seen them online so I had to order them and when I received them I fell more in love with them The color is so bright and perfect

I like the product because they are very comfortable and I am style They look good with all outfits and you can wear them anywhere

It is comfortable and matches any clothing He uses it everyday

They run a tiny bit big If you want a tight fit then go half a size down but if you do not want them snug just go with your normal size Other than that they are great

I love this shoe Very comfortable and provides great support The only issue I had was that my foot does slide down to the front a little when I walk because the platform is so thick But I do wear a smaller size so maybe it is surface area I have a size 5 in men and in women I am usually a size 7 but would size down to 6 5 Also the width of the shoe is a bit greater but not to an uncomfortable point

I got these shoes today and there amazing I definetly recommend these to everyone Super fashionable

It is great it has it allstyle comfort good price and quality

The color combo of the shoes are awesome The fit is very comfortable and also looks good with jeans

I like the product because they look really nice and the little details are everything on these shoes

I like it because its comfy and it has a clean look

They do run a bit too large so I would recommend trying them on or just going a half size down from your norm

Very comfortable and lightweight shoes I recommend it

I love the shoes they are comfortable and they are very easy to clean They are really light and feel as if you are wearing a second pair of socks

This product is a shoe that seems to be able to hold up and last for quite a while

Very comfortable and stylish Go well with everything I wear Glad I bought these Highly recommend

These shoes extremely comfortable and amazing thank you

great comfort fits perfectly I love this shoe and i get tons of complements

These r2are truly the best for the price The quality is perfect the size comfort etc 10 10 would recommend

This shoe is GREAT all around The look is nice and matches with anything I totally recommend these shoes to anyone

I like it because it feels right for my feet it is also have a good Quality to it

I like these shoes because they are cushioned and are more comfortable than most others but I still would like more options in sizing I have wide feet and these feel smallish and the configuration on the sole is full of round holes that I could feel thru the shoe until I put in an insole from other shoe That said they are now supportive and cushioned and I love them

These are my go to kicking around sneaker I get lots of compliments on the look and the color goes with tons of stuff The EVA plug feels a little odd at first but breaks in nicely All day comfort

it was great wish yall had more sizes But overall super comfy

Would buy again Only better if toe box was padded more

Great shoe I love it and would recommend to friends

These shoes are SUPER comfy and I get tons of compliments on them I honestly might buy another pair just to have once my current ones give out on me bc I really love this shoe

I love it very good shoe Good price Good shoe Heck yea

Very comfy I can walk with then for a very long time

They fit perfectly and look great they are the perfect casual shoe to wear everyday

Very comfortable shoe good simple styling that looks forward and back I am not a huge fan of the additional wedge at the back of the sole but it does not affect my overall opinion of the shoe

Great quality great durability great fitting and the comfortably is on point

I have Plantar Fasciitis so boost and ultraboost was the best materials for me I can walk all day and not feel the pain except for 1 thing The piece of plastic on the side of the arch is hurting me Now my pair of NMD R2 is collecting dust in the closet I have transitioned to Ultraboost Uncaged and I am happy now So if you are a runner with foot injuries go try it in store first

Adidas is the most comfortable sneaker I have ever purchased

They fit great look great and are super comfortable Love these shoes

Stylish and comfortable shoes Light and a great deal

I love the quality of the shoe Perfect material I have never worn any of these shoes before and they are super comfortable and for the price I totally recommend them

These shoes are very comfortable and came in a true to size fit At first the EVA plug did bug my foot but after wearing them longer it eventually broke in

Pretty comfortable fit Exactly what I was expecting Slightly narrow but it may just be me

They are very comfortable and light but the best part is they look awesome

My first NMD purchase I bought a half size down from my normal 13 and love the fit These are not made with PK but they are still a very well made shoe and look very good on feet The gum bottom soles are on point I highly recommend

the shoes are very beautifully designed while providing high comfort they are perfect for those who are into the beige look that has been hitting the runway for months now think kim kardashian and kanye west I highly recommend these shoes as I am satisfied with my purchase and believe you will be too

Soft cushion all around Could use more in the fore foot Not sure how long the foam will hold up

Bought these for my daughter who picked them out and she is very happy with them

Great shoe NMD patch digs in to arch slightly Other than that it look and fits great with great initial quality

it is more comfortable than you would expect Looks nice

They are so comfortable and look great on my feet Wish I could buy more of them in different colors

I like the grey orange color combo and the texture of this fabric These shoes are pretty flexible much like the Nike Frees I do not use them for running just for fashion so I can not speak to how they work in any kind of sporting activity it is just fabric on the top so not a lot of protection if something falls on your foot

I really wanted to like this shoes I kept it with me for over 2 3 weeks before i decided to return The molded midsole plug on the left leg became very uncomfortable it kept pressing against the foot arch on the inside and would not make it comfortable to even to walk No issues with the right leg though I expected the shoes to be really comfortable as everyone says but unfortunately it did work out for me

These are the best pair of shoes that I have purchased It truly feels like i am walking on clouds I would definitely purchase another pair and I also recommend these shoes to a friend

it is very comfortable during the cooler days of winter and fall During summer I could see it being too cozy to wear regularly If you are looking for a cozy comfortable shoe this is it

I thought the shoe was going to be something different but it still looks good

The shipping was fast and secure i got what i expected and i really love this great shoe

These NMDare the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I usually wear flat bottom skate shoes and I bought these for work and they are amazing

As we all know the NMD shoe is great looking so no doubt about that there I think the comfort is a firmer type of boost also I do not know if it is because I have not broke in the shoe yet but I have pain when walking in the shoe near the forefoot pinky area

I def love these sneaks The quality is dope def a good sneaker

The shoes are Super comfortable and the perfect fit

Son states he can feel seam on inside left shoe Overall happy with shoes

very simple stylish and really comfy looking forward to more colorways

I love these shoes because they are beautiful comfortable and quality

A pair of shoes I bought for my adult sonbirthday

Because is very nice are softy and I like it so much

Comfy and perfect The shoe is light and soft on feet

It is extremely comfturble and lightweight for a shoe

very nice made shoe a must have for your stock thanks addias

These were for my son who is a big fan of NMDHe loves the comfort and the feel Better than any shoes he has worn so far The special pricing was the icing on the cake Glad we bought these

This product is very comfortable and they look nice with almost anything

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Style is fantastic Only con is that one of the stripes has started to peel off after 2 weeks of wearing the occasionally

I bought these shoes for my boyfriendbirthday and he absolutely loves them He refuses to wear them in public because he does not want to ruin them

This is a great shoe I wore them everyday for almost a year I used them for running although this is not recommended if you want your shoes to last longer and just for everyday use I bought them in my size in NMDs

I like the shoe because the comfort the style and design I have many Adidas these days and the colors match certain fits

One of the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Great arch support and sole It feels like walking on a cloud and the stride is very quiet Only wish there were more options with darker soles and a layer of waterproofing

I was a little worried that the shoe would be narrow and uncomfortable I was relieved once I received the shows They are comfortable and gives support They are also not tight narrow on my feet which is always a plus So far I would say I am pretty happy with them The design of the heel is a little awkward and I occasionally step on it or scape against it but other than that it is all pretty good

Its very nice and comfy I will recommend it to my friends

Gift for my cousin Comfort fit and size is perfect He loved it so much

length is fine but is too narrow shoes got squeeze to sides and bulge out

Very good price and very good quality And they way that the shoes fits is good feels almost as good as NMD r1

love them comfortable work with everything did I say comfortable

I love the product because it a well designed shoe that has comfort inside

Good fit Dry comfortably Not sure about durability since I have only had the shoe for a week So far I am pleased with my purchase

Good looking and comfortable Like this sneaker Wear to school and gym

The blocking element on the inside of the shoe was very uncomfortable for me If I could have tolerated this it would have been a great shoe

The orange color rubber on the insole outside of the shoe messes up the beauty of the shoe It was hard to find a pair of the NMD shoes without that rubber orange piece

shoe seems to be pretty fragile i was hoping for more

Bought it for my son he loves it mas gift he like the way it feels when he walks or runs on it

This was an excellent purchase I got a boost shoe at a wonderful price Great color that was identical to online photo

I am obsessed I have always had knee problems and I work on feet all day sometimes up to 15 16 hours and I would not be able to do it without my Adidas The comfort and support is amazing

Not really crazy about the two toned stripes but it is ok I needed a dark grey colorway and found one with a gum bottom at a great price The NMDin general are great pickups

they are contable and love the looks of the color wish they will have something better to clean it do to product material been really soft But Love the product

comfortable beautiful design fits my feet very well I have used them for several days and I have loved

love these shoes they look even better in person

I would buy this shoe again and again Super comfortable and very stylish can not go wrong with that

Super comfortable and very active and fun to wear

They are very comfortable and are a good looking shoe

Loving them Love the way that they look and feel great shoe for the price

The plastic bit on the side dug into the arch of the foot and made them unwearable

Look normal it is not comfortable like nmd r1 before

Been wearing nikes forever did not like adidas because of the comfort and style Tried a pair of boosts in store and I am now converted The styles are now even better than nikes comfort level much better as well I suffer from plantar fasciitis I am on my feet 10 hours a day and when I started wearing these for work I feel more energy and no pain at the end of the day while looking fressshhhh Give the boost technology a try I assure you you will be converted

Great pair of shoes and very comfortable Would highly recommend

Love the comfort and look but fabric edgeswhere it conects to rubber sole is already starting to fray 1st week of wearing them

The shoes fit perfect Even with a thin insole it makes it even more comfortable

They feel like slippers and fit perfectly I will definitely purchase more Adidas shoes in the future

I pirchased This shoe as a start to my sneaker head collection and it turned out to be a good purchase besides availability being an issue I got A half size lower than my shoes size but this shoe is a little tight so if you want room I would Go a half size up if not true to size fits well and comfortable

I own multiple shoes and these are my first NMDs These are currently the most comfortable shoes that I own My only gripe is that they run a little long I usually wear a size 9 but I went down to a 8 5

The person I got them for says he likes the look of them the color khaki tan and they are super comfortable I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is overly high for what they are

They are awesome some of my favorite shoes ever Very stylish and comfortable boost sole gets dirty easily and not super durable but I do not see anything else that is not almost perfect

Great product and great service especially this close to Christmas

I liked the style of this shoe but it was far too narrow for my foot Beautiful build quality and design

Thought they would be more comfortable Ball of foot I feel every rock or bump

My son has a wider foot so Adidas are usually a good fit for him He says these are the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned and is just thrilled with them

New design is great Love the color scheme Really nice look

I got this for my boyfriend He loved the color and model

Nice style Good fit So far the quality of the shoe is pretty good

They are very light weight feels like you do not even have shoes on The comfortableness is off the charts

Looks good and very comfortable A good unisex style

Great product Extremely comfortable and lightweight

I love the feel and look of comfort st an affordable price

Nice looking shoe have received a lot of compliments

Next to the Ultra Boost there are no shoes on the market that is better in terms of comfort Going a size and a half up would be ideal but going true to size is the nice snug fit

They look good on him and fit him comfortably He was really excited to see them come out of the box The style of the shoe is different but i like them a lot

They look great and are really comfortable to wear

I need to exchange it Please advise me on steps needed for exchange

Very happy 12 year old after finding a box of NMDunder the Christmas tree

comfortable and stylish They Run large tho reordered half size smaller which fit perfectly

I bought the shoes for myself and it has met my satisfaction

I bought not expecting a lot but it exceeded my expectations It was a little hard to get used to because Boost is a totally different feeling but the thing is amazingly comfortable

May need 1 2 size bigger but my son likes them very well

I got the shoes for my boyfriend for Christmas He loved it The style and design was even beautiful than it looks online I got the tan ones for him He loves the style and the shoes fits him with comfort

It was my daughters best gift and a nice surprise

Great shoes amazing price All day I dream about shoes

I orderd this for myself female and ordered half a size smaller because NMDusually run big but these run true to size Love the style of this shoe but the rubber on the side of the shoe is very oncomfterbe If diggs in to the side of your foot Idk if ordering a bigger size will fix that problem or wearing thick socks Other than that it is a stylish shoe

Cool unique colorway and very comfortable fit Would definitely buy again

Comfortable Stylish Great purchase i really recommend it

it is like warlike in air with these kicks Adidas always comes through

This is an excellent she I am 63 and 210I CrossFit 3 times per week and will not use them for that as there is not enough cushion in the fore foot I use the Beast from Brooks for that but as an everyday shoe this is great Lightweight and great cushioning for everyday walking Will buy it again

The color strip that was moved to the inside rubs on my foot arch making for an extremely uncomfortable shoe to wear

Great design and the color is perfect if you are looking for something bold

Really comfortable feels like walking on nothing 

NMD is one of the most amazing shoes crafted by Adidas Original R2 is extremely comfortable and it looks more wonderful when you receive it than what you see from the picture

Very stylish and perfect color for the fall The fit is true to size no need to guess

These shoes are great They are both comfortable and stylish I am a women that is a size 8 and ordered a size 7 in men for this shoe They are true to size

GIVES ME CLOUT EVERYONE SEE ME HEATING UP THE STU IN THESE AND THEY WANT MY SOUNDCLOUD NOW

I am a girl but I love those so much comfy style got tons of compliments

I have collected a few NMD over the last year and these get the most feedback from people around me I went half a size up on this and the fit went from good to perfect I highly recommend you do the same These are not as red as I thought I get a close to burnt orange look from them

Great shoe one of the best color ways in terms of style and it looks good with most outfits

Amazing product for my boyfriend He said they were dope

Way better than my other shoes that were more expensive totallly worth every single dime

Very lightweight shoes that go everything Super comfortable and they feel great everyday

I have low arching feet so these shoes were uncomfortable and hurting If I had a normal arch then these shoes would be perfect Everything from design material and comfort in the heels

Make me feel like I am walking on a cloud of cotton candy and showcasing Adidas latest style on a fashion walkway

Simple It is perfect size very Comfortable Like the shoes

Awesome color and loved NMDs will always buy addidas products

Needed A pair black boost but could not find a style I liked This ended my search

They look and feel amazing I recommend this shoes 100

I loved these shoes because they are comfortable and stylish

I love the shoes as they are both fashionable and comfortable and can go with either a very sporty look or more business casual approach to your weekly wardrobe

I purchased these as a gift for my fianc xc3 xa9 and he loved them He has received so many compliments from his family and friends He felt a bit weird in them since they were so softThe color is great because it combines well with any outfit and it is perfect for everyday casual or semi casual looks

over priced LITTLE LOOSE MY FEET GET WET FROM RAIN

they are probably the fastest go to shoes you can think They look good with any outfit i love them

Both my sons love these shoes They have a black pair each

I was excited to order them and when they finnaly came in I was ecstatic and now I am thinking of buying another pair to give for Christmas

FIT IS COMING TOGETHER

I purchased these for my husband for Christmasbut I love Adidas and I know he will love them as well They came in a timely mannervery pleased

the shoe looks good seems well made However if you have a wide foot look elsewhere The plastic piece on the medial part of the shoe I can feel when im walking around Its pretty uncomfortable as the corner digs into my foot

I love these shoes mostly on how they feel and also on how they look The thing that really sucks is when the boost gets dirty and it looks ugly but you can just clean it with some shoe cleaner products

I am usually a size nine but I feel a lot more comfortable with a half size smaller Great shoes though

I love the boost option the upper material is great in the summer but not so good in wet conditions

Great shoes overall Only complaint is just below the bottom lace eyelets near the toe of the shoes there is stitching that does not stretch which is only slightly uncomfortable but not enough to not wear them

My son liked the shoes and he feels really comfortable in them

Awesome shoes really comfortable and stylish I had to order a half size up after getting the first pair on the small side

Much better than any other pair of shoes I have owned so far extremely comfortable and stylish Would buy another pair

Other than that I loved the shoe

Stylish and Comfortable Great quality materials

Good with everything worth the monetary value

Great fit and boost is great as always Love it so much hope you make more let me know

Very comfortable slighly narrow size is perfect overall i love them

Those plugs on the sides are making this shoe uncomfortable for me Returned it

Good quality and it is very comfortable when your wearing it

They are really comfortable and fit perfectly The only downside is they are hard to clean so take extra good care of them

Perfect fit really comfy and soft Seem sturdy and long lasting

Amazing shoes Gift from my girlfriend Love them

Looks good but could be better in all black Very comfortable

The R2are more comfy than the R1to me plus the boost feels more supportive on these compare to the R1The R1are still beyond comfy but these take it to the next level

It good they are very nice I am going on the way home now I am leaving my moms car and I do not want you guys going on

I had my eyes on these shoes for months and finally decided to buy them they are absolutely beautiful everything from the color to the material I am more than happy with them and have gotten so many compliments My only con if you can call it that is that there is not enough support inside but buying Dr Scholls fixed that Still beat shoes ever

I have not found a nmd I did not like and I own 6 pair

The boost feels more comfortable and supportive than the R1The EVA plugs are noticable on feet but it took a short amount of walking to get my feet used to them to create an overall shoe

It looks great and it feels great and I would purchase this over most shoes on the website

The show is great but not comfortable at all Used them one whole dayand from start to finish my feet were tired and sore The size was good fit so that was not the problem

Hurts my feet by sticking my foot with plastic on the side

great color and comfort Also great for its price

Awesome Bought for my son not easy to find shoes in his size and are acceptable

I bought them for my son and I think they are over priced due to the material and quality they appear to be made

I really liked the shoe it is durable and very comfortable probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

These shoes are one of the best shoes I have ever bought They are also so aesthetically pleasing and look amazing

Love the R2 just need more color options in the original R2 like there are in the Primeknits

Wow this has been a shoe I have been trying to get ahold of for a while now and I can say it lived up to my expectations it is super comfortable shoe while also being stylish A combination I believe adidas a gotten right in every way

You can send that for Thai people who like adidas

My 15 son loves them

Bought the NMD R2in anticipation of doing a lot of walking for an upcoming vacation did not want to but a true walking or light hiking shoe solely for this purpose trip The NMDproved to be a good choice It even rained on us but due to the material and lack of insole they were able to dry out by the next day

I love these shoes but i would love if at checkout you could buy some cleaning kit I know they are white shoes and they will get dirty but id like to keep them clean

Awesome Got Many compliments in school perfect in every way

I have a problem with the arch support in the right foot

Very comfortable shoe fits perfectly The bar on the outside of the shoe rises up a little bit into the shoe making it slightly less comfortable than it could be Amazing shoe quality good looking shoe

Causes my right foot to get a blister on the inner middle portion

I absolutely love the adidas nmd line They are hands down the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Look great and feel great on feet Reasonably price compared to other NMDs

They were a perfect fit Need to buy myself another pair

There is some kind of dull point in the arch of the shoe it feels like its where a few different parts of the shoe are adhered together Anyways this point really bothers me when I wear them Overall I LOVE boost and I am a huge fan of NMDs so I was pretty disappointed to have this issue with my first pair Is it possible they are a lemon or has anyone else noticed thisMy girlfriend said she does not have that issue with her NMD XR1s

what is not to loveIncredibly comfortable super stylish will not be my last pair

was not quite ready to get ultraboosts so tried these out first They exceeded my expectations

they are comfortable to walk in and they feel noice

Very comfortable and good price Would recommend to all my friends and family

They look great Fit great Bought for my husband he is very picky Shoes have to be comfortable and stylish not an easy task You usually get one or the other Both accomplished

It looks great it feels great Def an eye catcher Love them

I love the shoe but got it a half size too small Other than that they are awesome

The size I had ordered is too small When will 9 or 9 5 become availableThanks

It is difficult to clean the white part on the sole of the shoe

Because it is comfortable and flexible and the color and way it looks is great

I bought these for my son and he loves them He has already gotten compliments

Pretty but overpriced Please make them more affordable

been dreaming of getting one absolutely happy with the quality

A bit small my japan nmd Pk are a 10 but these R2 feel a half size smaller

They fit nice they look amazing and are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

I have had these shoes for 7 days and the boost is already starting to fall appart There is also a very small hole But they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

My grandson like the style and fit Will order again

I got them for my fianc xc3 xa9birthday and he loves them Says they are very comfortable and go with everything The only thing I did not like was shipping I wish you had other options for shipping and hope it happens soon

Best adidas shoe super comfortable and good looking

thought the shoe would be all black and have the same material as the triple black japan but overall great shoe when it comes with comfort

I like the shoes fit style color But when I opened them they came dirty Hopefully can be resolved asap

Love how comfortable they are and the overall look Got a lot of compliments on them

they are great looking shoes and very comfortable I think these shoes are great however a little wide but perfect size length wise

light and comfy

It is really comfortable and stylish I would highly recommend it to everyone definitely buying more pairs in different colors

These shoes are probably the comfiest shoes I have gotten If it was not then I would not have bought three nmd shoes Great comfort and great looks Would recommend to anyone

I like it cause it is great and it looks amazing and is comfortable

These shoes are super comfortable and they fit really well

I love the look and how comfortable they feel also they are very light

Comfortable and sizing was spot on Would recommend these shoes to everyone

Would not change a thing Just keep offers no new styles and colors please My 12 and 15 year old sons are all about the new selections for regular everyday shoes

Shoe fits perfect Very comfortable shoe that you can wear with many styles

My feet are very flat as well as wide which makes these hurt when I walk because of the rubber peice at the arch of the shoe but if you have average feet this would be a great buy

Love my shoes I love the look and comfort

it is tight was expecting mesh but felt like primeknit If I knew I would have gone half a size up

Stylish as well as comfortable Exceptional support from Adidas boost soles

Awesome shoes that fit well are extremely comfy and are the single best shoes I have ever owned

The shoes are slightly too narrow for me personally the square bit on the side of the shoes can dig in to the side of my foot of I step incorrectly Otherwise they are very comfortable

They look great feel great and everyone compliments you

I absolutely love these shoes They are amazingly comfortable and I wear them everywhere

Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice

these were my first boost experience and I am without and doubt satisfied with how comfortable it is Would definitely recommend to my friends

Super comfortable and light I love them very much

Nmds are all the rage lately and these were the perfect addition I bought them as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved them They were a little snug but not enough to send them back Great shoe

My son says these shoes are super comfortable They look durable We will see

The shoes are very comfortable and good looking it has a great modern look

Boost is life boost boost boost boost boost boost

My son loves this sneakers It fits nice He likes the quality

This is my second major adidas shoe my first being EQT but these are on another level They are beautiful and comfortable I will definitely be buying more boost shoes in the future

I liked it because it is what I expected and I loved how fast it came in the mail

Let me start off by saying that I love these shoes they look great but there were a few flaws I feel like the soles of the shoes could use a bit more cushioning to support your foot more Then my second issue was that the outspent on the inner side of the shoe creases very easily on the corner which I did not like at all 

product is great but shipping took 6 buisness days not 2 to 4 like promised Other than that I love the product With most shoes right when I put them on I think oh no I need to wear these all the time to break them in However with these the first time I put my feet in them and started walking they felt like a shoe I have worn for a whole month The adidas boost Is what helps with that

The comfort is definitely worth the price 2nd pair of R2s that I own and you cannot go wrong with these shoes

I like it because it is good quality and fits perfectly for my feet

The shoes are better than i expected Very comfy

I have never had a shoe with boost in it and to me this is a game changer

Comfy and great for street wear Really good for school but I recommend getting a second pair of different shoes for 

These shoes are very beautiful very soft I love it

The r2 is very comfortable and very stylish jaw dropper

Love these kicks bought a second pair Def buy a half size smaller Love nmd I find the r2 to be more comfortable than the r1

Very stylish get many compliments on them in public comfortable

The insole was not giving much cushion barely comfy

The shoes are very light weight and comfortable They are also very stylish I would recommend this product for a friend I already have 2 pairs of NMDs and I definitely would like to expand my collection

Shoe is really comfortable Satisfying purchase Glad I made it

like it very much will buy another style love it

The shoes are great and look very very good I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of NMDs

I bought these shoes for my teen son He loves them He says they are very comfortable and he likes the fact that go with everything no matter if he is sporty or dressed up

Purchased for my son who just started high school and suddenly cares about his appearance They look great and they are so comfortable I can tell he feels confident wearing his NMDDefinitely a great purchase

best shoes I have bought in a long time I might buy some additional pairs just to have as backup

this is cool nice to go with any ootdand any on the go clothesxe2 x9d xa4 xef xb8 x8f

The shoes are nice but they are not as comfortable

Bought these for my son he loves the way they fit and how comfortable and stylish they are This was the first of two pair I purchased last week from ypur web site and will not be the last Thanks for always putting out great quality products

Love the shoe extremely comfortable Only complaint is the foam block on the inner side I can feel it slighky poking into my arch As I break in the shoe though it has gotten better

Almost no insoles but feel okay with very thin socks

At first the shoes feel narrow around the bridge of your foot but this gets better over time The style is cool and worth it

Shoes are ugly The mesh looks cheap Too many different types of matieral

My son really enjoyed them and he said they are nice

I have bought nothing but ultraboost every since they came out way before they were cool I only bought these shoes because there is not an all white ultraboost I must say that I am very pleased with these shoes The upper is not primeknit but it is comfortable and stretches to a degree The cushioning is not as responsive as ultraboost but it is very comfortable I

I did end up returning the shoes as we need all white for school

These shoes are so nice to wear and look really cool

Love my purchase but it sucks that it gets dirty so easily

bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them he says they are very very comfortable

The style and design was very unic and they are very confortable

Product seems to be good quality Maybe a little over priced

Very comfortable and unique color Great to walk in and use for leg days

I love it It feels really soft due to the boost and aesthetically it is pleasing

This pair of NMD are not just good looking but they are also super comfortable

The shoe is very light and comfortable the only complaint I have is that it is slightly narrow but I have wide feet so that could be it otherwise amazing shoes

I am usually a size 10 but I had to get size 10 5 in these I fell in love with them at first sight

I like the product beacuse it is BeastMode they are so comfortable and fashionable

Its nice looking znd good quality I want to buy more

Very comfortable and easy to wear shoe as an everyday shoe Not sure yet on working out in it as that has not happened yet

they are nice They have a lot of cushioning not as much as ultra boost but a lot

easy to match with outfits get dirty kinda easily but not too hard to clean it feels like you are walking on clouds

Most comfortable sneakers I have owned to date highly recommended Especially for Big Boys

This shoe is so comfortable I just wish that I could explain it to you It feels like walking on a cloud whilst having all the support that one needs depending on their foot shape I have a high arch and this shoe perfectly forms to my foot Thank you adidas

I got the all white ones and do not be worried of how the all white looks It can be a little much for some but overall it is a very good looking and extremely comfortable shoe Very versatile can be work to work out or as a shoe to look good Great purchase

They are extremely comfortable and are good enough enough quality that I can wear everyday

Stylish Most comfortable shoes I have purchased I do not buy shoes that often but I got these before a trip and i wore them on my vacation when we did tons of walking and running they feel amazing Fan Fo Life

This white color is clean and looking good Soft and casual I prefer them than primeknit ones

Bought these for my boyfriend and we both love them Very comfortable and stylish

I like this product a lot because it is very comfortable and very stylish This shoe is one of the best shoes I have ever worn

Looks great on anyone really stylish liking shoe

I love this shoes but I would like to see this style all black with white boost and strap on back

Love the boost line of shoes They all have the bounce and support you have come to expect from this line

can not go wrong with NDMs Super comfortable and made really well

It was good but the first time I wore them the mesh was already starting to pull up

Great shoes for standing all day For my next NMDs I am thinking a different color at the bottom than white

Like the shoe it is comfy and gives support light weight

son said side kinda hurts but after putting a comfert sole in the bottom said its much better

Anything With Boost foam I get a half size larger

I like this shoe but it is a bit tight I had previously purchased the AlphaBounce Adidas in size 11 5 and they fit perfectly the same size in these is a little tight and almost do not fit Get a half size up

These shoes look really good but unfortunately they really hurt the insides of my soles

Super comfortable and good looking tennis shoe Soul feels like walking on a cloud

Great quality product laces are a bit too long for me though

Very comfortable fit true to size and overall dope kiccs

I liked that the sneaker was tts I was able to feel the blocks on the them which became uncomfortable throughout the day The quality was poor because the sole started to come off after 1 wear I do not expect nmds to be hard wear kicks but after 1 casual wear I can not recommend these

First time buying NMD shoes and I already love it

New design is modern with throwback elements love it Bounce material is extremely comfortable Materials appear high quality and look like they will last Very happy with purchase

Have been looking for a white casual sneaker that adds style and comfort This fits both Will be buying more

The shoes are very comfortable and very lightweigt

These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn great look and just a really nice shoe

one of the best shoes that i have very comportable

Loved the fit color and style Will definitely buy more

because it was a very easy process and it was a very great purchase

The way the shoe really adapted to the size of your foot so the shoe has no creases is really cool

The nmd r2 is a really good looking pair with great build quality The only downside is the fact that the plugs on the sole on the rubs against the inside of my feet slightly which is kind of annoying

Love it I personally get a half size bigger and insert a Dr Scholl insole for added internal comfort Overall great show Maybe Adidas should consider adding insoles with their Pure boost XR1 R1 and R2 lines

All white can not go wrong The larger boost sole in the r2 is really comfortable I have slim feet so the main body has a little room left over The length size was perfectly true to size Great looking shoe with pants and or jeans Well done

Love the fit and the looks only thing that I can say bad about them is the arch does not line up with the arch of my foot I can not go on long walks with them Without my feet getting sore

Extremely comfortable and light Perfect for long days

They are one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a while

Not the best shoes I have boughten Wish they were a little larger and more comfortable

So comfy nice detail perfect fit Will buy more in a different color

Flexing is funespecially when it is comfy The style is pleasing to look at and the price is so appealing especially for the quality and the short shipping time

Great shoes I recommend you to buy them

it is comportable for walking and the quality is perfect

Very nice buy would buy again and again and again and again

Not quite as comfortable as the ultraboosts but a major improvement over the original nmdI would definitely buy more of these

True to size as well as exactly what is promised on the website 10 10

Great shoes They fit nicely and are very comfortable

So comfy Great for running and just about everything else

look and feel great really like white shoes and these are really nice

Approaching UB comfort Mid sole sorta hits my arch but it widens over after a couple wears

Yes I like quickly delicery nice style comfortable shoes I like NMD series

My son loved them they were a good fit a bit narrow but overall very nice and comfortable

i like it a lot because the show fits perfect I never have any feet problems when i wear these shoes

it is comfortable for everyday activities and fits like a glove

Nice A Little big but very comfortable and light

Great quality shoe Boost gets dirty easy but is easy to clean up Other than that would recommend this shoe to every person looking to buy a pair of nods

Cool comfy and stylish to wear Order came quickly

The shoes are extremely comfortable The grey and black accents compliment the all white base well The style of the shoes match almost any outfit Walking is actually enjoyable in these shoes

Liked the product Always been a fan of addidas shoes Good quality comfort and support

This is the first shoe in a couple years I have been extremely excited about Love them

Just what I was hopping for when I tried them on After a while I forgot I was even wearing them My Favorite pair so far

These shoes are super comfy and the are made out of premium materials can not go wrong with them

Comfort and technology are spot on Well done on design Adidas

Cause there cool and they look really nice there comtable

very comfortable looks and feels good love the color

Without loud design queues these shoes show off a clean and original style while remaining very light and comfortable for quick sprints or long walks These shoes look so good I even got the pair in white

I have the all white as well as the grey R2These not only look amazing but are super comfortable I have done workouts in these as well as used these for casual wear Easily the most comfortable shoe I have purchased Now let us see how long I can keep them white

Shoes are very light smooth on the inside Like the additional sock as gives more comfort and stability

this is shoe is so comfortable and has an amazing design

I highly recommend it good for long walks

I am an NMD lover and one of my favorites are the red ones Not solar although I have always wanted them I was excited for these The color is not pinkish orange than red They need to be crimson or darker at the least From Pictures they look great but that is it Would really have liked a darker shade of red

Not super comfortable at first but improve over time

Adidas always impresses Great fit and feels good on your foot

Great product and great price so comfortable and they fit perfect

it is is comfortable and the design will match almost any outfit good quality and very happy with this purchase

Great comfort and quality Boost is now something I do not want to live without

Comfortable Stylish Love the heel band Ordering was easy I could wear these all day every day Very breathable

Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought The boost bottoms are slightly wider than what I expected This caused me to accidentally step and scrape the sides of the bottoms Although after I have gotten used to the shoes I have had no issues since

Very Good I like that and i love adidasxc2 xa1 xc2 xa1 xc2 xa1 xc2 xa1 xc2 xa1 xc2 xa1 xc2 xa1 xc2 xa1

I love the shoes as they fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable I also have a pair of he NMD R1 which are great shoes but the R2 in my opinion has them beat I am considering buying a second pair if my wife lets me

The product is super comfy as to be expected for boost I typically teeter between a mensize 7 5 and an 8 mostly due to width so if you have a wider size foot I would suggest going up a half size If I had opted for my normal 7 5 it would have been way to small otherwise awesome fit

The NMD R2 are one of the most incredibly light shoes that also top my expectations for comfort and sizing

The placement of the plastic block on the sole is poorly placed and actually digs into the arch of your foot which equates to a very uncomfortable experience Other NMDI tried did not have that block

Nice pricing

I first saw them on the website and fell in love with them The rear detail heel loop adds alot to the overall design The shoe does not come with an insert Instead you walk on top of the boost material That does make the getting in and out a little tricky because the material can grab your sock and make it hard to slip in and out Also I noticed that the shoe makes me pronate a bit as I walk I will have to see if I can find a way to correct that but otherwise the fit is great and the knit is really comfortable on my feet

Great product My son likes the flexibility of these shoes

I spent a lot of money and I felt it was worth it

My first time trying NMDand am 100 satisfied about all the things about them You will not regret going for these shoes

I have several NMDand these are just as great I love the color style and comfort The comfort of the NMDis unmatched by any other shoes that I own

Wore this on my Marathon for the very first time and this shoe did not disappoint me

Great looking pair of sneakers that goes with anything

Amazing these will be great for college next year

r2 way different than r1 original nmd would not suggest buying shoes

I do not like it I love it I will not recommend this shoes because I want to be the only one to have them hahaha

True to size and very comfortable Looks good with any casual sporty style

The shoes are really fly and they are not too expensive The knit feels great it is snug and light The boost xe2 x84 xa2 also is extremely comfortable Would recommend to anybody

I love my NMD R2 shoes They are so comfortable and fashionable

Also the shoe is clean

I just love the adidas style the nmd are one of the most comfortable shoes on the market

Love how they fit my feet I feel like I am just wearing socks

This product is a very comfortable shoe and a very good looking shoe I could wear the shoe with almost anything But the foam thing on the inside of the shoe can cause some discomfort at times

Stick with the UB3 Great shoe other than the side rubber digs into your foot

Nice design and very comfortable Would highly recommend to friends

Great shoes for work nnn

Unbelievably comfortable eye catching and a perfect example of why Adidas is Alpha

They need more of a disign on the outside of the shoe

The shoes look nice and feel really great They fit TTS I got the white and they pair nicely with most clothes Just get some water stain shield for shoes and spray them

Already becoming my favorite sneaker to wear straight fire

I bought this pair of NMDs and my husband LOVES them He says they are super comfortable and can not wait to get another pair

This should have been a more comfortable feeling on the feet

Shoe looks great I wear a size 9 but could have went with a 9 5 because it is a little narrow other than that awesome shoe and quality is great

like walking on air and great for your feet body and mind when you stand all day and are comfortable

This is my first adidas purchase A friend recommended these to me and so I bought them I am definitely glad that I did

Comfortable great design easy on the eye Perfect

Nice Got two pairs One for me and the daughter

Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Like the shoe details and materials used Great fit

Very comfortable the best shoes I use ever in my life

I have been an Adidas fan since I was 10 And am 58 corporate is great I love Adidas keep it coming

The NMD R2 is a awesome shoe The quality is top notch and the hint of red in the heel tab is just the right amount of color to stand out

The black strip really show with the all white

I usually wear a 12 5 or 13 I got these in 12 5 and they are still too big Also the strap in back looks 100 red on your site but it is actually orange when it got here

Great shoes In case you have bought previous versions of the nmdwhich run a size big they got the sizing right on these They run true to size so order your regular size

Comfortable and stylish looks great on the feet Just like walking barefoot

I bought a men6 because I wanted the white and they did not have all white in womenI normally wear an 8 men 7 and I heard they run large so I went for the size down and it fits perfect feels like I am walking on pillows

Block hits side of foot and does not feel good at all

Great style and fit Probably buy 2 more pairs Best sneakers ever

Comfortable and light on your feet Great for running as well as an everyday fitness training shoe It does fit a about a half size bigger But once you get the right fit it is nice and snug on your feet

adidas finally came out with a lot of great style comfort and colors I should have start buying adidas when they first started making the those NMD

These shoes are surprisingly comfy and good looking

Unfortunately this is one of the worst shoes comfort wise I have ever gotten It is a good style shoe but the second I put it on my feet I was immediately disappointed by how uncomfortable the shoe was I was really looking forward to getting it

does not look as good in reality once received as online

This is a great shoe from Adidas Great build quality and style the length fit was also perfect Unfortunately the NMD R2 and some other NMDs too are just unusable if you have wide feet The flexible knit like upper material does not do a good job of keeping your foot in As a result signature NMD foam block digs into your foot with every step you take Due to this I unfortunately had to return the shoe and buy some Ultra Boosts instead So overall it would be a perfect shoe if Adidas lowered the foam block or found a way to make it less intrusive for people with wide feet but if you have wide feet like me I can not recommend these shoes

Great quality and look very clean Highly recommend these shoes to everyone Very comfortable and not too narrow or wide They are perfect all around

Just got these shoes today on 07 17 17 and I ordered them on 07 14 17 They came fast within 4 days so I am happy about that I am usually a size 12 in shoes but the nmd fit me a bit big so I go with a size 11 5 and the fit perfect I would recommend going a half size down in these nmdOverall these shoes are nice and they are super comfortable

fits like a sock feel like walking on clouds loving it

Great colors and has all sizes and not too wide or too thin

I have recently purchased these Nmd sneakers and they are very comfortable they feel very simuliar to the primeknit version

Yes cuz its comfortable its great for everyone to wear

Is a really good product with the perfect selection of materials

These shoes are good although they are a little bit long

They are comfortable the color way is incredibly creative and perfect look Great support

I like the look of these shoes I bought them because I thought I might use them as a basketball shoe Probably will not because I do not want to mess up the white

Everything is great about the shoe except the traction

I have been nothing but loyal to Adidas but if i spend my money on another basketball shoe with the same outcome i may have to find another brand whoproduct is more consistent

Forefoot kinda wide and the heel is slipping

Very comfortable for basketball did not even need to get broken in Good amount of cushion Fit me true to size

Purchased my fourth pair of Damewith the Dame 5These are the best yet I can not wait for the Dame 6

MY NORMAL SHOES SIZE IS 11 BUT I ORDERED 10 1 2 THIS SIZE 10 1 2 LENGTH IS GOOD WIDTH IS EXACTLY WIDE FOOTER WILL FEEL IT TIGHT I WANNA RECOMMEND NORMAL SIZE FOR WIDE FOOTER SHOES ARE COMFORTABLE BOUNCE CUSHION IS ALWAYS AWESOME NEVER DISSAPOINTED THANK ADIDAS

Wish they were wider Very disappointed they do not fit They look awesome and they feel like they would be very comfy But if you have wide feet I would not recommend them

The best new colorway of Dame collection The minty green looks great on the court or the arena Everyone will stare even if you have no other game The shoes perform well on the court Great tread for cuts Goid support for ankles There is a little more room in the toebox than usual But this is not a big deal It is better than all these new iterations of bball shoes trying to squeeze your feet like they are soccer shoeslooking at you KD and LBJ

IDK why but been shooting better lately tooMaybe it is the new found confidence

The shoe looks great and is very comfortable I own all the Dame shoes and these are the best so far

Very comfortable and a must have I have the Dame 4 and I had to try these I love the colorway

Very very comfortable You can get away with wearing no show socks which is a huge bonus Never understood wearing socks half way up my leg

Logo Lillard La Heem Lillard Dame Big Game Dame Dame Dolla Dame Time Lillard Time Regardless of what you prefer to call the man his shoes are the Pinnacle of basketball performance perfection a lot like his game is Highly recommend Give this man some recognition nationally for real

these shoes were a bit tight at first but they really fit good once you break them in I have only worn them a week or so now but they are my favorite pair out of the 7 or 8 I have

I slid all over the court when using the Dame 5s The grip is not good and I was concerned about injuring myself while using them I noticed that the soles easily collected dust which I believe led to this issue although the courts I play on are typically well cleaned

This shoe is so comfortable and lightweight also it has pretty good traction This she I definitely worth the money

For being a cheap shoe at 115 the materials design and comfort are the best out there The felt does seem to catch hair but other wise perfect shoe Nice colorways and nice how Dame cares for the people

I am a huge Lillard fan and I always rocked the Dame 4in the gym and I thought he could not make them any better Well he did Dame 5are even better in every way

I have owned every version of Dameshoes and have liked each evolution better than the last These it great are much easier to get on and adjust than the 4and have better feel performance and looks than the first three generations

So after playing with these for a few games I have to say I am really impressed Overall these hug my feet so well and the traction is out of this world I only wish that Adidas would have a hybrid basketball shoe with boost on the heal and bounce on the midsole Get some cushion when you land and bounce when you take off IDK maybe in the future but for now these are the best there is

I bought this shoe and they run very long and very narrow Beware They are very sharp

Dame 5 is the upgrade of Dame 4 which means that has all the good features of 4 slightly better like grip controll comfort support Almost the perfect shoe for me In my opinion the only drawback is the new design which is not so good compared to 4 But the overall quality is more premium than before

Perfect shoes on the court that give good support but are super comfy and durable

LOVE the new Dame 5s Really comfortable and look awesome on foot can not wait for the Suga Gee

This shoe runs large but it is an amazing shoe I am having to go a half size down I have spent a lot of time looking for the perfect shoe and I think I found it in the new Dame 5

If you have wide feet like I do Get These Shoes

They are very fresh shoe and fit perfect Mays well get them

These are super fresh Love the new design and I can not wait for the other colorways I am to design some customs Dame Dolla just put out what I think might be his best shoe yet

Overall FitTrue to size

These have a nice casual style and are really comfortable The variety of colors makes it easy to buy a pair for every outfit and look great

You cannot get any lower price than Finishline do not play yourself

I bought these for my son who has wide feet He loves them the red is bright and stylish He likes the comfort and look

I love the 574from New Balance They are my favorite sneaker These grays are no different I love the style and the color It matches so much in my closet They are so comfortable I bought a half size up just to make sure The price was below right plus my membership reward coupon how could I resist Buy them

Well made and good looking shoes The fit was just a bit too narrow fitting and no wide width was available bummer

Love the classic look of these shoes and have gotten several compliments They look great with jeans

get compliments when I wear them

Sweet shoe can not go wrong Have received many compliments from old heads and young folks

4th pair of 574but first leather pair The material fits a bit different than the usual suede After the break in period usually the suede almost starts to wrap around the shape of your foot however the leathers stay a bit more rigid Not bad at all just different from what I am used to for 574s Great look The black upper and gum sole is a great style combo Will consider getting more leather pairs in the future along with the usual suede

Sexy shoes I have received so many compliments I really enjoy how they look with shorts I enjoy wearing them without socks and they look good with my shorts and legs

Like the shoes can not wear Very narrow Going to return

Bought these for my husband he absolutely loves them

Very clean classic shoe Seems to run a bit small but over all a good shoe

The shoes are really comfortable and very stylish I will buy more of these shoes

Very comfortable nice clean style reasonably priced whats left to sayVery pleased you will not be disappointed

like the style and the colors the shoe is very comfortable i used it to go out and not for running Ybecause it looks good with what I wear have others shoe for running I am getting 4 other pairs for shore I am a ADIDAS fan and that is all i wear but saw these shoes and the colors and I said let me tried them and see was up and man it was a good buy BUT i will never replace my ADIDAS

Overall great pair of shoes I wear them for exercise and casual wear Both very comfortable in either area of activities

I usually wear shoes of size 10 5 Nevertheless these are much smaller and bring a lot of discomfort to me I can not find check and box to make a return I think this was a throwaway purchase

My husband bought these blue white after he saw the same ones I bought for our 3 year old son He fell for the look before he bought them and fell for the comfort after he received his own pair He LOVES these shoes

Size runs small and very narrow Poor fitting Would not recommend

Very nice looking shoe I have this pair and a red pair Both are amazing but are not really comfortable after walking for a while in one day

I love them lightweight and great arc support will definitely recommend

The color options the fit and the brand is American i believe I took a chance with these red and black ones because the online pic looked ok But I am glad i did because the color red on this shoe is bright red just like i hoped Jesus answers prayers lol These are my 5th pair Currently browsing for my 6th

This shoe is extremely comfortable and looks cool I like the Retro look of this New Balance shoe

Most comfortable shoes ever Currently Own 13 pairs

The New Balance 574 has never let me down I own multiple pairs and each time I wear them they just seem to keep getting better I have a flat narrow foot and it gives me the support I need especially in the arch area Overall you can not beat the quality of this shoe

Great looking color and feels good makes me taller too

Wore this at the new balance store It felt great and was kinda big at first I have super wide feet and I wore a 10 5 and it was pretty loose i wear a 10 5 normally I went down to a 10 fits great feels great and really comfortable and looks casual but also has a bit of prep in it so it looks good on dates and parties

THE FEEL LOOK AND QUALITY OF THE SHOE ONCE I GOT IT IMPRESSIVE THEY ACTUALY LOOKED AND FELT BETTER IN THE STORE do not KNOW WHY I will not COMPLAIN THAT IS THE CHANCE YOU TAKE WHEN YOU ORDER OFF LINE BUT SINCE I WAS ASKED TOO DO A REVIEW I DID OTHER THAN THAT I MIGHT WOULD BUY ON LINE AGAIN THIS IS MY FIRST PAIR OF NEW BALANCES AND THEY ARE COMFORTABLE JUST HAVE TO SEE HOW THEY HOLD UP AS FAR AS RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND NOT SURE UNTIL THAN BUT do not WANT TOO GIVE A SAD FACE SO TOTALLY

Comfortable and I get lots of compliments They are excellent for walking and light exercise And cool enough to wear for an outing

always been a fan of New Balances and these do not disappoint

I always like the shoes which looks short from front side This pair is exactly what I always wanted to wear I love it is style and pair is comfortable for whole day walking or driving Great grip on slippery floors too Always love to keep at least one pair of NB

I had been looking for a pair of athletic shoes with these colors for awhile and was greatly pleased when I found these They fit well and are very comfortable and stylish

This is the first pair of New Balance shoes I have ever purchased and I am very happy with them They are comfortable and seem like they will hold up well

Great shoe so comfortable great price great quality unique light and goes great with jeans

finally finally found this shoes at last nice summer shoes and the colorway is off the hook gets a lot of compliments with the color brown will soon get another pair

Great quality It is comfortable but runs a lil tight I would stay true your size or go up half a size do not go down

this style fit tighter and a lot less comfort

I really love the style of these and so happy they are also so comfortable as well I am very happy with my purchase

Although these are listed under Dad Shoes my teenage son loved them They look like something we wore in the 80s He says that they are very comfortable and he loves the color We bought the blue ones

the shoe is so soft and is a great fit i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good shoe to use on the go

Great design the right shoe is a bit uncomfortable though

i bought this shoe 2 weeks ago and i just never really fell in love with the shoe It was a good price so i thought i would give it a try but do not waste your time money on this shoe You will be let down just like i was

I would and will be buying another pair when the time comes to replace them

do not think about it just purchase these shoes The react cushion is soft as heck And the carbon fiber plate springs you forward while running to make you feel like going even faster Just a fantastic shoe to run in

I have had good luck with other neutral Nikes pegasus odyssey but these do not provide any support I have run in them for about two months to make sure I was not just having a hard time getting used to them but the combo of the completely flyknit upper and pretty flat insole has put lots of strain on me

I wanted to like it at this price point it is just not worth it

This is a great shoe as its very cushiony and feels good on the feet The Flyknit forms to your feet and I prefer it over traditional uppers on shoes The only problem is its hard to lock your foot down with the laces since they are not designed in a traditional way I ended up purchasing a 1 2 size smaller and the shoe fits perfect The Flyknit expands so I did not need my true size and now I am able to lock my foot into the shoe better

After 100 miles the bottom outsole on the outside of the shoe started to wear after 140 miles the carbon fibre plate was exposed seems like maybe there is an maybe an 1 8 inch of outsole that covers the plate These were strictly flat street miles

I do not usually right reviews on shoes but I had to write about these shoes First of all let me say I am not a runner I only run about 4 miles per week I am not training for a marathon and I am just a guy that is getting more into running slowly I am writing this review based on the durability of this shoe My right foot is half a size smaller than my left so the carbon fiber plate in this shoe makes the right shoe slip off my heel The lockdown in the shoe is great but I was not anticipating that little snag I really put some strength into those shoestrings and that shoe really locked down They are fantastic shoes and are still doing great I was worried the shoe would fray or just flat out snap but it just locks me down and I am off Great job great shoe

I thought these would be bouncy comfortable and breathable That was true but I you are not traveling in a straight line they are not good because of the narrow heel

I can not wait to put them on for each run they make running so much more enjoyable and fun riding through the miles Bravo Nike Designers Now I just need to set up Go Fund Me to try the Nike Vapor Fly 

These are my current race day shoes Very comfy and they have a good spring to them thanks to the full length carbon fiber plate The shoes are a little heavier than I prefer so I will probably throw them into my training shoe rotation and get the vaporfly for race day I wish they would come out of more colorways for the vaporfly though

Just put 3 miles on these Feel about like the other ones I got a year ago

I absolutely LOVED the first generation zoomfly it improved my speed and reduced my injuries because it worked for me and the way I run

I was not a big fan of the first generation of the zoom fly This generation is definitely an improvementhowever I still have issues with it On the positive side the fit with the upper has definitely been improved with the addition of Flyknit and it no longer fits a half size small And the removal of Flywire is a plus in my book The shoe is also more comfortable and lively than the first generation which was a shoe that just felt dead right out of the box However although it is an improvement I still think the shoe is lacking in this respect And oh boy is it heavy for a shoe that is pegged as a race day option In fact that is probably the biggest problem with the shoe Because Flyknit is so light and the stack height is so massive the shoe is very bottom heavy The stack height is not a problem on the Vaporfly 4 because zoom is super lighthowever the zoom fly is full length react which is not nearly as lightweight The end result for me anyways is that the shoe just does not feel fast even if you are running a quick pace And it feels somewhat awkward having such a high percentage of a shoeweight underneath your foot I know some peg this shoe as being both a racing and training shoe but I believe there are better options from Nike for both categories

If you need race shoes and cant find the 4 go with the Turbos instead of these

I have put 10 miles so far I enjoy the flyknit the react soles and carbon plate Those ingredients make for a great shoe but the fit is all off for me It runs a tad narrow but the biggest issue is the heel slippage I can not get it locked down If they could mold it like the Epic React Flyknit than I would keep these shoes

Admittedly I was not a fan of the original ZoomFly but wanted to give this pair a try I put 400 miles in the OG ZoomFly but felt that they were lacking something that I was hoping to get in the update Sure enough it feels like I got it The ride is very responsive with the new plate and react foam which allows for comfort on long miles or faster miles I have used them for 100 miles so far mainly long 15 20 miles and harder workouts ranging from 10k Marathon paces I followed a recommendation from Nike and went a half size up from my Pegasus 35 size and was happy I did no rubbing or anything at all I am sure I could go down to true to size but I wanted a more traditional fit versus a tighter one which seems to work better for longer runs

This pair does not punish heel strikers to some extent we all are after mile 20 like the original zoomfly does Comfortable and feels effortless in all paces my 5k pace is about 7 10 10k pace is 7 30 Marathon pace is 8 16

I had the Zoom Fly SP and unfortunately they only lasted me a month before one of the rubber pods came off the bottom but other than that and them running a whole size small I loved them I upgraded to the flyknit expecting to love these more than the SP But after about 5 runs my biggest complaint is a total lack of lock down Unfortunately with the flyknit and the absence of flyWIRE getting a good lock down especially in the heel is almost impossible Secondly wearing higher cut socks is a must due to rubbing of the ankle area I had the same problem with the epic react although not as bad Other than that even though the plate is an actual carbon fiber and it has react instead of lunarlon I felt the ride really felt the same Which is not bad considering the SP improved my running times by over a minute So if lockdown is important to you I would say stick with the original or SP versions

I have been a big Zoom Fly fan for the past 9 months and this update makes me love them even more They have got the cushion for a slower run and the speed for intervals and tempoI love this shoe and use in on long runs track days and tempo runs exclusively

Nike Zoom Fly Flyknit in action The most comfortable yet functional marathon shoeI test it in action to see if performance matches expectations

First I want to point out that I owned Zoom Fly Zoom Fly SP ViporFly 4 and Pegasus 35 Turbo They are all my favor shoes So I thought Zoom Fly Flyknit with carbon fiber will be another great shoes for me Almost except one serious flaw The side of the shoes sticking too high and cutting the skin of the ankle joint All other shoes have a curve around that area but not this shoes I could not use it to walk for a short distance without hurting Now I am wonder if I am the only one having this trouble with this shoes since there are no review I read talk about this

i consider both fashion and the function and this shoe suits me better than the React

just did my second run and I am loving these shoes At first i was not sure if the size was right and I had to check the shoe and box to see if they were really a size 10 my nike size for run and tennis they felt small and tight but after walking around for 2 hours before my first run they settled in nice and I love these shoes

Great update from Nike already loved the original Zoom Fly This is a lighter and more responsive version it is my first Flyknit shoe and it fits like a glove The 4 is probably the best long distance road racing shoe out there and this is close behind and can still be used as an everyday trainer Incredible to have so much cushioning and still be able to click off fast miles can not wait to try the upcoming 4 Flyknit

I love Nike shoes they are comfortable and very nice

They run about a half size big and a bit narrow but still comfortable Good shoes

These sneakers were perfect for me the fit was awesome and the color was great walking in the sneakers felt like you had nothing on and You will not regret purchasing them

This shoe really looks awesome and it feels great on foot it is much lighter than I thought it would be too Wish there were half sizes past 13 The 13 was too tight narrow so I went with a 14 which is a little big Overall very happy with my new kicks

I highly recommend very comfortable and light on feet amazing color and true to size

Once I wore these shoes I knew I made the right purchase I have been eyeing these for awhile and once the Aluminum and black color released I had to get them Besides the comfort they just look good So If your thinking about purchasing these then think no further

I do not really wear other brands besides retro jordans and shell toed addidas but these these right here I had to The design is so dope with the vapormax bottom they were calling me I love the feel the bounce the look Its a lil tight but after breaking them in i love them

Loved the style and color combination But the arch is high could definitely hurt someonefeet Nike failed with this one Happy returned it No problem with finishline

Love the shoes and the style Have wore air max for years These are by far the best feeling and light weight shoe I have worn

In my opinion these shoes are outstanding The quality and comfort is amazing No pressure points at all on my feet Conforms to my feet perfectly Wow can not wait to purchase another pair but in a different color

just got these shoes today and i love them probably the most comfortable shoe i have ever walked in i tried the flyknit ones first and i did not like the way the looked and they seemed to be to tight but i ordered the same size in these ones and they are perfect

Nike has done it again this is one comfortable shoe They just came in the other day and I love them

Great comfortable shoe Colorway is great The material of the shoe is smooth amd super soft I will definitely purchase more

Let me first say I love this shoe I get compliments on them all the time and I love wearing them However I would recommend going a full size up The upper is flexible but the shoe itself is pretty narrow Walking in these shoes have a small learning curve because the midsole is pretty thick it is pretty easy to roll your ankle

just wanted to know if the color scheme for the wolf grey dark grey black is the same as the still photos or the one that the model is wearingit is 2 different photos I ordered the still photo and waiting to see which ones will arrive

I am very skeptical about ordering shoe wear online because of my weird and narrow feet LOL also because photos seem to look better than the actual product however I decided to take a chance on the Air VaporMax Plus in Black White I am glad I did Simply put AWESOME shoes They fit perfect and look GREAT Lightweight very comfortable and stable at the same time They are indeed true to size and feel like they was made specifically for my feet

The shoes are very appealing look great and firm grip however they seem to run narrow and the arch can create some discomfort after wearing for several hours Also they tend to squeak on waxed floors

I have 2 pairs of Vapormax Plus The first in Orange Sunset and the 2nd Black White sole The 2nd is a size smaller I wish they had wider or half sizes so that I can give 5 stars These shoes are very soft comfortable and they stand out A little pricey but worth it

Absolutely lovely shoes bit pricey but quality is best

Great shoe overall but not true to size this is my second pair of vapormax and I have come to the conclusion that they just run small

I bought these for my 16 year old son to wear to school in our Minnesota winter He loves them

can not go wrong with a classic style Good quality and feel My only complaint is that I only received one of my second set of laces

First time to purchase in Finish Line Shoes were delivered on time but the other pair was missing an extra lace The color was already faded and it is like it is been already worn Returned the shoes to a local Finish Line and ordered the same model Delivery was fast and finally the shoes are in great condition but the box was fully torn from the side This is not an issue with Timberland but with Finish Line on how they prepare the shoes for shipping

I would return the pair and get another one but I might just get the same thing again and I have to wait another week to get them

Very satisfied with purchase price delivery customer service And ease of returns when needed I think the shoes could have a more comfortable padding in shoe for price But I bought as a Christmas gift for 18 YO Grandson

Great shoe for the price can not believe the deal I always gets outstanding deals at finish line

The left one keeps rubbing my ankle They are made of genuine leather and it seems the leather on left boot is a little thicker which caused the pain

This is review is not an issue with Timberland but an issue with FinishLine The boots I received looked to be worn The already had a crease at the toe they scuffed and even had a scratch on them So to say the least I returned the boots back to my local FinishLine How do you sell a product in that shape to your customersDo you not inspect first before selling themWith that said I am official Finished with FinishLine

I wear Timall year round since sixteen best boot that was ever made would not wear nothing else

I have these and other tims to match every outfit their awesome comfortable too

I could wear these all day I love Tims Love the look and feel

Arrived earlier than expected like the look true to suze

great shoe just by it a 1 2 to small very comfortable

Boots were nice got them on sale for 100 got them for my boyfriend He loved them also they are more of a light grey color not the dark grey color they look like on the screen Overall great buy and true to size

bought the brown and green pair with the black sole came super quickly and exactly as described i normally wear an 11 5 12 in nikes and an 11 11 5 in vans and the size 11 i purchased fit me great i have wider feet also

I was happy with the my purchase and the way i went about purchasing the product I had a bad experience with footaction but finishline made up for it The boots are comfortable and well worth it

Very nice and A different look my friends love it too

I been wanting to get these for tha longest time I have already owned tha wheat but this color looks soo good You can def wear them with any outfit not too sure bout shorts and serve as a casual look and can also be considered formal in my opinion Of course go with one compete size lower do not make that mistake Other than that of you have had your eyes on these there should not be any questions why not to buy them Yea they are kind of pricy but you def get what you pay for

They fit whole a sz too big I wear a 11 in everything had to get a sz10

The color and style is great just what i was looking for Goes with all my casual clothes

I purchased the all grey ones and they fit perfect very comfortable too As always I would recommend them to a friend The sale price and the rewards coupon I earned was the bonus shipping was fast and the Boots were in a new unopened box

Size is to small for him and tge colors are hard for him to maintain He wants to come and do a refund or exchange overall I love them personally

He has plenty other footwear but wears these as often as he can So happy he loves this gift Fits true to size and clearly comfortable My only issue is I paid for rush shipping and it did not get there until 2days after mas Foot action did reimburse me though

Nothing better then a fresh pair of Wheat Butters

When I received the shoes the shoe box was inside another box and the outside box was fine but original shoe box was ripped on both sides when they were delivered to my house The boot itself was already separating from the sole Such poor quality

Looking forward to continuing business with you we need more deals

I thought the sneakers were very nice until I put them on but as I wore them I noticed they were uncomfortable

Bought these shoes in January I do not use them everyday and the fabric is falling apart and squeaking as I walk after 2 months The leather on the toe is peeling off of the shoe and the stitches are shredding do not waste your money

Very comfortable true to size easy to shine Only wore few times now but shoe feels to be one that can be worn all day without aching of feet or legs

all black very comfortable using them for work as a waiter

The air are very comfortable I wear them for work because I stand alot

it is comfortable and fits like a glove

These shoes are awesome Bought them for xmas and they never dissapointed me

I have these and got them for my boyfriend to match

My husband loved them Fit was great quality is superb

I bought all white ones Easy to get dirty but the look is classic and awesome

Love style Love fight Only after 3 times of wearing they began to squeeky which really sucks Kind of disappointing

The sneaker was cut very tight and firs too tight on my foot and it was my actual foot size

I debated for a while on whether to get Air Maxes or not because I was too busy buying other sneakers geared more for my work outs But I eventually wanted a sneaker that was comfortable and I could wear more casually as opposed to working out or dressing up I like the design of the menblack as opposed to the womenblack less flashy I love these They are comfortable classic looking and everything I needed They do run slightly small narrow so I would try them on first or possibly order them half a size up Overall great product

The sneakers is very comfortable and stylish I will most likely purchase them again

Nice shoes but they hurt my feet from the start I have a normal width foot These shoes run narrow I returned them immediately Nike customer service was excellent Return was simple The return label was already in the box All I had to do was slap on the label and drop them off at the UPS store

Awesome running shoe comfortable true to size I recommend this shoe

Custommer service was great thay sent me a pre paid return label ThankBill am

When I got these shoes at first they seemed too tight All I needed was to break them in Wearing the shoes for about 7 to 10 days did the job Ever since life is good They are very comfortable really protects my calcaneous bone heel bone and the color is super white Really recommend them to anybody looking for style comfort and protection to their feet

Very comfortable Came fast My favorite pair of sneakers I currently own If i am gonna do some walking I choose these to wear

These shoes are very uncomfortable and not worth the price I was very dissatisfied with this shoe especially being a product of NIKE

not only are these shoes comfortable they look great with cargo shorts

I have an original Air Max 90 from back in the day and this one has less padding and is less cushy than the original but I guess that is the they do not make them like they used to thing applicable to just about everything in the world

Nice design Simple but eye catching and the all black look just screams fresh 2 def And on top of all that they are probably the most confortable sneakers i have ever put my feet into if you wear them right if you know how 2 rock them people will stare at these like if they were new jordans ESPECIALLY IF you GOT SHORTS ON all 4 a real decent price too

These Shoes are amazingly comfortably and beautiful You can wear them just about anywhere or keep them as a collectible item

this is one of the best pairs of shoes i own great price too reduced im guessing because of the color but im diggin it

I love these shoes because they are very comfortable They are a little heavier than my other shoes but it are still great shoes I use them for walking not for running however they might be useful at running I own the 241

Fit well comfortable and have an awsome look for the price

Adidas is always my go to shoes for workout comfort

Love these sneakers very comfortable can wear all day

I have had my eyes on the adidas swift run for awhile now but they usually never have my size When i found them on sale my size i had to buy them They are holding up well and i love the materials knit on my particular pair I work 8 hours a day and it is mostly walking so i could not be happier for the bargain that i got

Nice looking show but shoe lace loop broke after wearing for only 6 weeks

Wore these to a theme park for a day and by the end of the day my knees ankles and feet were in so much pain The insole is too soft and provides no comfort or support The worst part is they are glued in the shoe and cannot be replace Adding an insole will make the shoe too tightnikeforlife

I purchased these for casual use and I only got to wear them twice before the loops for the laces busted

Stitching on the front tore after couple of wears Poor quality material Would not buy this again Son was disappointed

This shoes are great Very nice looking Wear them to gym or school Would definitely recommend

Love these it is like walking on pillows all day Would recommend to others

Shoe does not have a regular tongue It is all one piece which made it impossible for me to actually get into the shoe which was the same size as all my other Adidas sneakers I could only get the foot in by bending the heel tab completely down which I then was not able to get up Impossible to get in that is sad since the shoe looked really great and felt top quality

Silhouette of an NMD yet no boost but that makes it so cheap If you are looking for an NMD Ultraboost alternative this is the perfect shoe for you

that is is comfortable soft and have a good look

I sized a half size down and they are still a size too large They built the toe box of this shoe so large my feet literally swim with way too much lateral movement On a positive note their appearance is dang adorable and I am so bummed that they built this shoe for Shrek

Love the color style and fit Solid base and cushioning for my feet

My husband loves it It fits perfectly and so comfy

they are comfortable and they look wsy better in person

Because of the style and quality of the shoe Also the price was perfect for me

I like this shoes because they are very comfortable

I originally purchased mine through the mi tool all black with gum sole I found the mi design order system to be what I would hoped The shoes were perfect no visible glue anywhere These were to be for casual wear use but I read a review that recommended them for running on pavement I tried them once and put them on permanent run duty Fit = TTS The toe box is fine and they are snug with good support in all the right places while remaining comfy not spongy on the step I highly recommend these for running on pavement as good as they look for casual wear The wider sole can be tricky on a treadmill but it is a minimal annoyance These still feel good for at least one more 8 9 month season of running so I am getting great ROI

Very good looking comfortable and lightweight shoes

The shoes were easy to break in The shape of the shoe is perfect for myself in my opinion Even when tied I could slip them on with just little effort which I find to be ideal Not to be mistaken for being too large but just a perfect fit shoe

The shoes are good but the sole is a little bit hard and not very bouncy

The shoe is definitely made for people with very thin feet

Very comfortable shoes Love the style color My favorite now

They are stylish and they are adidas so of course I love them

Fits great love this shoe Love the fit and the way the shoe feels on my feet

I have bad plantar facialitis and the heel of the shoe is not best to be on for hours on end but overall a good shoe

My boyfriend loved them the size was spot on and the color is amazing He thinks they are so comfortable and stylish

Going into the store they looked at me and i tried them an would fell in love with them fells like walking on them clouds and their style is just giving me chills sighs

This shoe blends in with the summer vibes so well

I love the style comfort but also the wider toe box

This shoes are vary conformable and I recommend them very much They get really conformable after breaking them in which happens after a week or so I do recommend to get 1 2 size bigger though

its got nice color and comfort and the way it fits is wonderful and I would really recommend this product

The shoes seemed nice but did not fit I purchased my normal size and the opening was too small to even try on without potentially damaging the shoe

Very good in terms of shape detail geometry and everything but unfortunately I did not get the right size So I was forced to take a smaller size because I liked a lot

Coming off an Achilles tendon surgery and they are very comfortable

the most confortable shoes that i buy in my live

Great awesome feel and look to the shoes Would recommend these shoes for the people to buy

Not flashy gets job done Wont steal the show

My son loves the style and very comfortable and looks great on

Love them they are my favorite running around shoe

Comfy

Love this shoe it is more on the inexpensive side and matches with everything in the wardrobe I honestly see the Swift Run becoming the new essential Adidas shoes it is a great first shoe for anybody who wants to test out Adidas shoes

Nice kicks look great and feel great i would recomend to get a half size bigger from you actuall size

These shoes are so comfortable and great for walks

They are a little tight at first but after that they feel very comfortable

Love the color and simplicity of the design Great fit and feel

Shoes are great fit perfect Slightly more narrow than I anticipated Otherwise super comfortable

I finally found a tennis shoe that supports my arch

Nice shoe but too small for me so I gave them to my daughter

Nice model and pretty comfortable They should make it little wider

I do NOT like the product due to the shoe being extremely narrow and tight fitting

Nice shoe A little hard to put on but very comfortable

I love the all black shoe It is also comfortable

Although comfortable these shoes are not as pictured

I like it comfortably and beautiful a my husband loves that shoes

The padding that your foot rest on cuts up under one my foots they are pretty comfortable but comparing them to my nmd they are no comparison Overall good looking shoe The width is a little tight

true to size breathable very good cushion when running

its comfy lil expensive i guess but worth it the color white make them look prettier but the qet dirty

Love these shoes perfect color They are super comfy and can do burpees without the fear of them coming off like other shoes

A little hard to put on since the tongue is sticked to the sides but overall a good purchase

Look and feel great I walk all the time and they give great comfort

I am a huge fan of the Swift Run style by Adidas They are comfortable affordable and fits my feet great I normally wear a 8 5 9 in women and I snagged these in a 8 men The best asset to my gym collection

I like this product it is comfortable and light highly recommended

Good fit super comfy they look great with everything

I purchased these shoes with the intent of only wearing them daily I did not plan on working out in them or running in them I was just looking for a cool pair of shoes to get around campus and these did their job maginificently I planned on getting 11 5s but I chose the 11s and it was a good choice They fit snug for me and stretched properly broke in over a week or so They do not give the greatest support for activities such as working out in my opinion as compared to other shoes I have worn but they definitely look awesome to just wear around The black shoes do have an odd purple hue in the direct sunlight but it is not that bad I wear them inside most of the time anyways All in all I would definitely buy another pair

Really like them They fit like my other Adidas and are very comfortable I wear them as casual shoes not for workouts

Basically this show is an outdoor slipper But nice

This is an interesting pair of shoes The tongue does not move sewn in placed so it fits like a glove around your foot The only downside to this is that it takes a bit more work to put the shoes on They are pretty comfortable and I love wearing them

Great product He absolutely loved it It was just too small so we had to return it And then they ran out of stock But i would definitely get these shoes

This is Excelent shoes it is soo comfortable and Good product from the best company

Bought this shoe and it is pretty comfortable At first to get the shoe on is hard it gets easier I would suggest getting a size up if you are looking to slip them on and off easy Great quality and nice design

It is sleek looking and it fits very well just wish the price stayed the same for every color

Very comfortable and stylish shoes bought the black and white and love both

This pair of running shoes was ordered online I took a shot at the sizes and did okay there but it is a weird fit I received a good price so meh

The shoes were amazing I will definitely purchase another pair soon

Shoe Fits too small must go a size up have not been able to wear them

They are fresh and stand out Many compliments received

These shoes were not comfortable at all they hurt

Color is awesome fits perfect Price was amazing thanks

Although I am partial to the NMD line of Adidas then are very close to the comfort feel

I only buy all black shoes for work and I am so in Love with these Very comfortable to stand and walk in for 12 hours Only complaint I have is the entry for my foot it is narrow and only has a slight stretch so getting your foot in can be sort of a struggle But once they are on you will love them Definitely recommend for running and or if you stand for long periods of time

Good shoe comfy and looks good I would recommend as a decent everyday shoe

not comfortable and no support Disappointed in this purchase

Great looking shoes very comfortable one of the best shoes I have bought in a while

Goot a GREAT PRICE SHIPPING Was Smooth On Time GREAT Shoes

When I received them they look a little burgundy color but still a great product

These shoes are extremely comfortable and stylish I love them

I have been eyeing the Core Black Swift shoes for months even trying them on in the local stores When i finally pulled the trigger and received the shoes i was elated Problem was though they looked great indoors as soon as you walk into the sun the knitted body of the shoe goes from jet black to a dark purple reddish brown hue in the picture you can tell an instant difference between the 3 stripes and the body Also the tongue of the shoe has the same knit but is jet black I really wanted to to like the shoes but i just can not get used to the color Have to return them unfortunately

Nice fit good look poor quality lace seams would not recommend be due to the fact that I can not tie my one shoe

Need to narrow I am thinking a return and if I can get comfortable in them they hurt my arch

Comfortable and classy They were a surprise gift for my husband He loves them and wears them all the time

These are the Most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever worn

it is very comfortable i went ahead and brought the black one

Good shoe good price also

Nice running shoes a little bit to narrow When the sun hit the shoes instead of looking black they look a little purple

Was looking for a comfortable and stylish shoe for everyday wear This pair fits the bill perfectly

This shoe rocks and looks better on It is comfortable while still being sleek and sporty I recommend A

This shoes are super comfortable it is my second pair and i love them

Nice looking shoe Very comfortable I chose the triple black shoe but the color is the show is slightly purplish Not true black but still a good looking shoe

Good product Black on black color somewhat dull Have to get used to the sock feel

This shoes tend to run a little wider than normal

I absolutely love these shoes This is my 4th pair I have 2 primeknit and 2 regular and they all fit perfect true to size and look great I highly recommend these shoes for everyday ware or gym use as well Very comfortable this pair fits a bit snug compared to the others but still feels great on your foot

My brother loved it and it is so nice to wear Perfect to almost all kinds of outfit The all black color adds a beauty on the shoes

Great everyday shoe Helps me give my nmd a rest

Looks sleek and is comfortable I can wear it to work where I am on my feet walking for 8 hours and I can also where it to boot c and where I am hit the floor hard or running I can also wear it casually with jeans and still look fly

Awesome shoes great fit Very comfortable shoe wore it all day long

They are superconfy and the look of black is beautiful so perfect love them

I love the style of the product just amazing Love the shoe

This shoe is reliable it is a great fit and can last a long time Very comfortable shoe as well

First time trying Adidas I love them I surely will buy more I am one happy customer

I think the design for this product is uncomfortable for the foot

I did not like the color but they did not have the other colors available in my size

Love the style and look Great shoe for the price

Love the shoes Very stylish and comfortable Great price to Perfect for the gym or just everyday

I wore these shoes for a week when one of the topmost shoelace loops came detached from the shoe the shoe would no longer stay on even to walk Otherwise fit and comfort were good at least for the week they lasted

it is a perfect fit Can wear it anywhere Super comfortable and looks good

I love these sneakers perfect for the gym and to go out super recommend

Great comfort amd goodlooking Wear it for working out and casual social events

I love them for running they are lightweight they are pretty good but for me it is kinda hard to get them in since of the narrow design 4 5

Great quick cheap purchase Nice look and comfortable too

I love that they fit snugly like a sock I dislike that they are not supportive enough to be my running shoes

Great shoes I am usually a women 9 in tennis shoes but I could not find the colors I wanted in women so I got a men I have purchased men tennis before and usually get a 7 5 but I read that adidas run a little big so I got a men 7 this time They fit great and are comfy And they are super cute

Very comfortable shoe and I have plantar fasciitis

I like my tennis but it would be perfect if they have the foam cloud sole or ultra boost soul

Comfortable shoe love it for lounging around Not great for ankle support though cutting changing direction or running Might roll an ankle Good looking and comfortable fit though

I got these to wear for daily errands outings nothing out of the ordinary They are lightweight comfortable and have held up well in terms of wear and tear Though they do not have Boost the sole provides enough cushioning for getting around Even better I can get these on without undoing the laces and they still stay in places while walking

i use this running shoes everyday for work very light and comfortable last me more than i expected

For the price I got it for was ok I needed black sneakers for work Not very comfort looks good

This shoe is poorly made they are hard to get on to my feet

These sneakers are very comfortable and stylish I bought them for myself female size down I love them

Comfortable good design and low price and it is good for running

The quality of the product is great but after a while you start getting wrinkles on the sole which does not look great

Great iI mean really great guys but I am too lazy to say more I like to cut it short thanks adidas

I sized down a half a size and it was fine at first Now it has stretched out way too much and it wont stay on well now after only 2 weeks

Very comfortable shoes and they look good for both the gym and casual wear

The all black is slick The sole is comfortable And these work for running gym training and even just stylin out on the streets

It feels great when running and is super light as well

They are good quality and fit well They are very similar to another brand but adidas always has great discounts

I want to start off by saying that I am really impressed by a few aspects of these shoesThe whole shoe is light feels durable and is a lovely uniform color I bought white on white which can be hit or miss with some shoes it is a brilliant design with only one problemit is unbelievably uncomfortable Around the whole mouth of the shoe there is a very thick seam that is pretty stiff it squeezes around the ankle and made my left foot even fall asleep I see most reviews list these as very comfortable so perhaps it was just a flaw in the pair I received

I love the way they look just wish they had a little more room

I work as a supervisor and constantly walk Good quality sneaker

I absolutely ADORE my swift run shoes i own two pair and they are my absolute favorite True comfort

Awesomeness Feels like air saw them in grey and green might have to get those as well

No insoles needed I normally buy insoles but these do not need them Found a 1 2 size smaller than my normal size worked perfectly Nice casual shoe that goes with everything

Hard to get on uncomfortable Feels like there is no padding inside

Stylish comfortable and affordable shoes Can wear them in almost any setting

Comfortable and it feels like they are not even on your feet that is how good for running they are

Would definitely recommend this purchase

Very good looking and comfortable but a bit hard to put on One loop on the back would fix that

I bought these for myself because I loved the style and wanted a navy shoe but did not find any in womenI liked So I sized down and prayed for the best They arrived pretty quick and the quality and comfort and fit and style is awesome I got a lot of compliments from women and men The latest Addidas styles have not failed me yet they are really comfortable whether I am working out or sporting them casually

The shoes are a great casual option for my wardrobe

Love these shoes I have about 4 different colors now and plan to get a couple more at least

The shoes look great as expected but my son did not like the fit for his particular feet However the return process was SO simple and free that I will definitely be buying from Adidas online for my next pair of Adidas

Comfortable easy to wear perfect sizing even though I got a 9 in menbecause the womendid not have all black

These are really comfy like really comfy I got these to workout in mainly and they are quality I would not use them for super long distance running but for everything else they are great Like a foot hug all day The soles could be more soft but that is always a hard combo with soft and firm Trying to give the most honest opinion I love the black with white soles The color is rad

Got this for her because she did not like the womencolors so she fitted a mensize 6 Perfect size and fit She loves the comfort and style and the navy color is amazing One of the best purchases

Fits well feels nice looks awesome No sizing problems

I love this product it is really comfort and seems real durable

Perfect comfort while running does not hurt my feet at all like other shoes

I am a nurse and on my feet 12 16 hours a day These shoes are heaven on my feet

Really affordable nice design look a lot of foot comfort

Good shoes for running after breaking them in with a few 1 mile runs they were ready to go Also much more comfortable than my Jordan retro 1s and they became my work shoes too

This could be my most favorite adidas shoe I have purchased simply because the fit and comfort was great from the very get go Actually I did not even need to adjust the laces they are still just like they came from the box So far so good thought great pair

They are really comfortable and I like the way they look I love them

I love the deep blue color and the comfort of this Swiss Run shoe Plus the price was very affordable

I love the fit and they are great for walking standing They look simple classic but great Also in sunlight my pair has an deep indigo hue which I think is cool

I got theses shoes because I love adidas I like the look of theses shoes but it is not for walking a lot in I walk a lot a lot 20 000 steps per day and I needed new work shoes However i do maintenance work so my shoes get dirt quick I thought these shoes would be comfy and good looking for work and Disney But they are not cool look but the bottom of the shoe is very thin and no comfort

It was not a good shoei felt this shoe is poorly made

These shoes are definitely the best I have ever owned Very comfortable easy to keep clean laces stay tied all day Amazing shoes

The sneaker is not comfortable it was not expected from Addidas

This product is especially great to those who want comfortable shoes

I really like this product because it is cheap and has good quality

I liked these because they really could go with anything

Stylish comfortable and not too expensive I am really enjoying wearing them

I liked this product because its very comfy Looks good with low socks Just have to keep them clean cuz they are white

The shoe looks good until you look at the back of it

Being a huge Adidas fan my wife bought me a pair After about a month of use and very rarely since I own about 8 or so other pairs of Adidas the lace loop broke It ripped out of the fabric so to speak I considered glueing it back but who am I fooling it wont be the same At the end great looking shoe but the material lace loop is bad idea I will stick to NMD or ZX Flux in the future

Yes I liked No so comfortable no enough support at the front foot long walking produce some discomfort at metatarsum

They fit comfortable I like the way they look but I wish I would not have got them in white

Took awhile to break in Good look and light shoe

These shoes are comfortable sleek and easy to keep clean which is a huge plus

I loved how the shoe looked and felt and I recommend everyone to buy this shoes

The shoes are amazing but they look a little red when I thought I ordered them to be all black

i am not sneaker head but the price for the quality and comfort worth every penny literally gonna buy another pair when my paycheck comes in

Good product no discoloration a little wide near the toe overall good shoes

All of my adidas i have purchased recently are so comfortable and perfect

My 2nd pair And that is a good thing Gonna get the blue pair next

Great shoe It molds to your feet White swift runs are stylish and you all never go wrong

My wife got these for me I wore them to work day 1 got them dirty I had to get another pair These shoes are supportive comfortable and lightweight Didnt even really need a break in period

I try it the first time and I love it I recommended

I am a female however I still got these mens shoes for myself They are super cute They run a little big but I still would have gotten the same size because I like a little room for my toes I unfortunately had to return them because the sole felt weird for the shape of my foot

I love them thinking about buying another pair

Love it for casual around town I would not run or work out in them Very comfortable and cool Got a bunch of compliments

Looks and feel great Love them Highly recommend them

My 3 pair from adidas website and haven had an issue Top notch quality highly recommend

Comfort and durable will not ware any other brand of shoes

run like the wind Fly like the sky Care what others think and you will be their prisoner

A great looking shoe and very comfortable As soon as I put them on it was clear I found my new every day running shoe

size different no good to clenched before was perfect same model

i thought my ultra boosts were the best thing ever but i love the feeling of these even more the fit around the ankle and the general foot comfort makes these shoes my everyday go tos also the color is killer and they go with a bunch of outfits doesnt have to be sporty i get comments how cool my shoes look all the time

Fuxking cool that is all I gotta say bout his shoes

super comfy pair and affordable pricing wish they had more colo selections

I came across these shoes on a ad and decided to buy them for my boyfriend since his birthday was going to be the following week He loves them and already asked me to buy him a second pair He loves white shoes and they look great on him

Felt the comfort as soon as I put them on and stood up Definitely recommend

Felt very tight at first so it took a day to get them broken in Almost returned them but glad I did not because they are super comfortable

Good walking around shoes have not tried running in them yet

This is my first ever pair of Adidas The right shoe feels more narrow for some reason The arch hits my foot weird and gives me a sharp pain I was thinking it is my feet but I have never had this problem with similar shoe styles in other brands

I have a thing for triple whites right now and these are perfect Comfortable and easy to slip on off Flexes with my feet as a walk as with the collar As with other all white sneakers you just have to be more mindful of where you step

I bought these because I liked the colors of the men sneaker better I am a size 9 in women and ordered a 7 in men I LOVE THEM Not even sure what the difference is between the men and women version is but these fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable I get a lot of compliments on them I got them in white I might buy another pair

Loved the swift runs Exactly what I wanted to get out of them and more

Had them for three months and I wear to the gym most times I go and the material where the toes are at is ripping have not really did anything to crazy but run in them as they are made for and it is already ripping

These shoes are comfortable and look fresh with jeans

Ordered it last week just came in today Literally took it out of the box just to find glue stains everywhere and some parts were not even glued completely you can literally see it falling apart a little How can a company as big and respected like adidas provide such horrible quality like thisSo disappointed Returned it did not even get a chance to put it on

I like the color black the style is unique and comfortable shoes

I wear a 8 in women swift run and 7 in men I lwas be the shoes for work since I work retail

Great feel fit and form Love the way I look as sport my Swift Runner Summer kicks

True to size and very comfortable I am 11 wide and 11 fit perfectly I usually go half size up swift run there is no need

Bought this shoe for general wear and working out purposescomfortable fit but shoe is already wearing at the seams

Very comfortable get compliments from female and all day to all night wear

looked great at first felt super comfortable and durable yet the stitching for the grey design is coming apart and the glue is coming off Kinda disappointed Only had them about a month

I love these new Swift Summer shoes so much so that I just ordered the white pair They are comfortable and fit perfectly I have a couple pairs of NMD that I really like but these are even more comfortable I love that you guys keep dishing up great shoes keep them coming

Awesome Quick delivery great shoes The overall experience was great

Great purchase and shoes are extremely comfortable Will need another pair



So light and comfortable One of the best pairs i bought in a while Can walk all day with these without worrying about hurting from foot pain

The color was too pink but perfect qulity and feel

Very comfortable and fit was just right I love the mesh it makes the shoe very light

I kept seeing reviews that told me to order one size up however if you have wide feet I would order your regular size Since the front part is very roomy if you have wide feet this shoe fits perfectly If you have regular or thin feet I would size down

Great shoes for both a sporty and casual look Win

The shoes are comfortable for walking as well as running

The swift run summer shoe is exceptionally breathable and comfortable

They are ok for the money Great fir the summer I will wear them

Amazingly comfortable shoes that look and feel great

This is a excellent item it is comfortable this arrived on time

Very comfortable shoe I bought two pairs Will buy more

It looks so good with jean so comfy for both walking or using at gym

I am usually a boost guy but I thought I would give these a try as they seem a bit more robust So comfortable especially for my very wide foot They fit true to size and the upper is flexible whilst being pretty tough The only downfall of the shoe is the laces they feel cheap and lack the quality of usual adidas laces however it is not difficult to buy decent laces and put them on

I was in need of an all white Adidas shoe I bought this shoe in redand fell in love with the comfort It was a win to buy them in white

Great shoeseemed to fit my boyfriend a little big but he loved them so much that he kept them Really happy with the purchase

I wanted a pair of adidas running shoes for a long time and finally decide to buy these when I saw they were on sale I usually hate all white shoes because I always manage to get them dirty but these looked too good not to buy They are extremely comfortable and lightweight and a great looking shoe to bring out during nicer weather

Overall it is a good shoe I would order half size smaller

These shoes are light and comfortable I love them

These are my new fave shoes They are comfortable They are not tight at all or too narrow but they fit perfectly Not too snug Just perfect I love the color all white it is a simple style that looks expensive but does not break the bank It also feels like you are walking on clouds I first used them to go running I bought them to wear at the gym but now I am using them for work

The shoes came on time and it what I expected I will recommend it to anyone

I bought these for my son after getting a pair for myself He saw mine and wanted a pair He loves them Says they are the most comfortable shoes

The feel upon sliding it on my foot the first time was really snug but comfortable and there was not any wear in time Much more sturdy than it first appeared and at the price during the sale it can not be beat

Been proudly wearing Adidas since 89 They have not fail me once

Son is absolutely satisfied with the purchase Thanks

Fits great Great style and has a good foot support

Awesome shoe for the price quality is pretty good also very comfortable

I am going to buy a second pair that is how much I love these shoes

I love the style the light weight the feel of the cushion against my heel and how well it holds my foot during workouts

They look great and I love them I know I look clean with my white sneakers

I do not think you can find a better shoe for the price Cannot recommend them enough More variety of color would be nice

Love the shoes Deff comfortable highly recommended

Sharp looking comfy shoes Would buy again Have received compliments the style

i loved this shoes is the better of the world my family and I liked

They are very comfortable They do not hurt my feet

I like them because of the comfort and look of the shoe

it is comfortable and makes my clothes Plus i have been looking for white shoes

Your foot slides right into the glove perfcet for me when im on my feet all day

Comfortable balanced make way for a great shoe woooooooooo

Feel good on the feet and easy on the back when running

Got them for the boyfriend for a gift and he loves them Bought myself a pair as well and they are the only things I want to wear

These shoes are essentially slip ons and are difficult to put on without a shoe hornthe laces seem to be for looks only However once the shoes are on they are comfortable and nice looking The only complaint I have is the texture of the insole plan on wearing cushioned socks

Looks great with workout or casual clothes Would definitely purchase again

I like this shoe so much that I wear it for everything casual running agility day and much more this shoe makes me wonder how about a BOOST pair it for me thinking if they ever sell a pair soon sign me up cause they be my favorite shoe to add into the BOOST idea one of my friends saidit is basically an NMD at that pointno NMD is not for running this is and BOOST would make this shoe even more Swift

I did not like the shoe because it was not blackit was more of a dark purple

This shoe is comfortable stylish and the width is fabulous I purchased this shoe in white and took too long to buy a pair in black Now the shoe is no longer available I have been everywhere no luck I hope it comes back really soon Great shoe Love it

These shoes are super comfortable and have a distinct look far apart from everyone choice now adays the ultraBOOSTs They look amazing and I can wear them all day they are also very durable nothing flimsy or cheap about them

I love the this shoe I will be buying the all black version

They are comfortable but the lining comes out quickly

Very comfortable and great fit for wide feet and good for everyday use

Nice shoe looks good and feels good Worked out in them and wore them to school Had a lot of compliments

These shoes are most comfortable than any bedroom shoe or flip flops it is like you are gliding instead of walking

The stitching on the back tore after one wear do not know if my shoe was faulty but it is a very comfortable shoe regardless

Has all the great qualities of the NMD All Black Japan Edition with the comfort of the Tubular Shadows As a person with a wide foot the breathable fresh knit uppers accommodate your foot while feeling sturdy enough to run with

Looks SO good on and the style is incredible Would recommend to a guy or girl

Adidas has really stepped its game up within the last few years as I have found myself staying away from buying other brands and purchasing more and more adidas products As a shoe collector I can easily say my new swift runs are one of my favorites and by far one of the comfiest pairs of shoes I own

I was browsing the Adidas store at one of the many malls present in my area and this particular new style caught my eye The design on the front is enticing as well as the rest of the shoe Something about this says future cool without breaking the bank The main highlight is its comfort level of course This is second to none the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I was originally going for the White version because of summer looks but I went for the Black version for my lack of enthusiasm to keep my shoes clean lol Customized versions available which is also a plus for those that want more spunk OverallFashionable affordable comfortable All that

Who does not like black on blackPlease see the picture below to see the newest member of the family

I have loved this shoe since the first time I saw it Beautiful design and extremely comfortable

Ranks number 1 in my collection Great look Great style Love these

This shoe is great to wear at the gym or just casually I have received alot of compliments while wearing this shoe The price is amazing as well I would not recommend for running as there are better options

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

It is very comfortable and good for all kinds of sports

The stretchy upper material is really nice because it gives a secure and comfortable fit I wish NMDfit like these

The color is not even black it is purple makes no senses

The shoes preformed extremely well and I loved playing in them but I have only had them for a week and the sole started to come off and the tab at the top of the tongue ripped off

One of the best shoes I have owned in a long time Great traction on the court and comfort The cushion is low and responsive I love the design and overall look of the shoe

Amazing comfort grip and mobility The best shoes I have owned in a while

I`have always wanted these shoes when i was younger I love the shoes Fits comfortable

I love these shoes I highly recommend these they fit perfect on my feet good for the price to very stylish

Ive always like the throw back shoes These Airmaxare classics However one their I can never get over is the inability for Nike to manufacture a comfortable throw back shoe Espcially for 150 for a pair of shoes Why can not they get their act together for the consumer and implement a running shoe comfort in these over priced throwbacks

Feels light on feet snug fit very soft Pliable too you can lift your toes and shoes bend with them I had Nike AIR running shoes and those were good but the air eventually leaked and shoes became unbalanced Tried Ultraboost and wow Very soft stable and could wear all day Looks GREAT too I run 3 5 miles daily and these feels great

Originally bought these shoes because I am a GOT fan The sneakers ended up being very comfortable and supportive

A great pair of sneakers They are very comfortable and offer good support I am on my feet all day and these are perfect for me The mesh allows my foot to breathe so I can virtually wear them all day I highly recommend them

I have never purchased Adidas shoes but I know what I was missing These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought and also they are very comfortable when exercising

These are extraordinary shoes I do not use them for running but easily my favorite show to wear around

it is ultra boost you can wear them all day and your feet will not be all tired and sore it is a great looking shoe as well You can not go wrong with it

Ultra boosts are soft and definitely give you a boost in each step If you have never worn them goto the store and try on a pair They are worth the price Out of the NMD Ultra Boost and Yeezys I can say that the Ultra boost is the most comfortable of the 3 Great all year round shoe too

These are very comfortable The only complaint is that they run slightly big to me at least But still a very good feel nonetheless All the detailing on it is really nice Especially the leather cages

Good fit and good materials Can be worn all day I like the black boost will not turn yellow over time

Recommend trying on a pair before purchasing to find your best fit

With the new season of GOT on its way and spring about to begin I had to snag a pair of these icy Ultra Boosts The ice white on top of the white is so fresh and so clean

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I would have given it a 5 stars if it is a little bit wider

I have been a checkmark sneakerhead for as long as I can remember The Adidas UB line is pretty much new to me and I have grown to love it I have got a collection of Flyknit Racerand these are probably just as comfortable if not more than the RacerI would suggest however to go up half a size They fit pretty narrow on my flat wide feet All in all I am very happy with my purchase

Need a pair of black and green for my workout gear and bought the ultraboosts They are so light and the cushion while working out is incredible Had a few people complement the kicks

Literally the most comfortable shoes out there Nothing else comes close Boost is life

Colorways A

First ultraboost sneaker and definitely not the last the price was holding me back but finally was able to get them on sale at a more reasonable price Boost comfort is amazing can walk in these all day Fit true to size Got the noble red and love the color Did want to mention they probably are not the best for standing long hours like I do at work since I get foot fatigue

i like this shoe a lot and I am happy to have them but they are so so expensive and i am not sure they will hold up that well

I have a few NMDand this was my first Ultraboost Compared to the NMDthe Ultraboost runs a little bigger About half size bigger and narrower than the NMDBut nonethrless still comfortable

Honestly ultra boost is such a distinct feeling that I highly recommend they are so comfortable and light

If you never tried on an Adidas boost shoe you are missing out They just feel so different than anything else Awesome cushion amazing grip and they are so light it almost feels like you are not even wearing shoes

My son loves these Unfortunately they did get dirty by the end of his first day wearing them and I had used spray protectant we bought at the sporting goods store I was not surprisedit is the risk you taking buying a teenager white athletic shoes

The Adidas Ultra Boost is hands down the best performance athletic stylish and comfortable shoe on the market Every time I am going somewhere I usually think about what shoes to wear it is not even a thought and I put these on Strongly recommend buying and join the Hypebeast community

Overall the shoe is great The Boost midsole and torsion plate is like walking on supportive memory foam The upper is super soft Softer than flyknit which I have 2 of Like neoprene on huarachesoft but cloth It hugs your feet but not too much where it is restrictive Which might be a bad thing if you run in them cause it does not have the lockdown on your forefoot like NikeFlywire tech Another con is how thin though grippy the outer sole is which can be a durability issue for runners

Bought these for my brother and he says they are the most comfortable shoes he is ever owned Admittedly even though they are too big for me I try them on all the time and I fully agree with him Nothing I have even comes close to them They are also really stylish According to him they stay comfortable all day and he does not experience any fatigue They are also pretty breathable thanks to the primeknit upper and it is small ventilation holes As far as fit he is a true size 11 but opted for an 11 5 and he says it is perfect He could have gone for his true size too but preferred having extra room True size for a snug fit half size up for more wiggle room at the toes He went with tripple white They get dirty pretty easily but they are not too hard to wash If you do it manually only use soft bristle brushes for the upper to avoid fraying Hard bristle for the boost If you want to do it through a washing machine stick them in a laundry shoe bag Highly recommend this shoe

Very comfortable They feel like your walking on clouds

The color of sneakers its great and its very comfortable fells great in foot hard not wear all days

Price was a little steep but the product was good

I have bad feet and with these shoes my feet do not hurt anymore

Love the shoes Use them for my gym workouts super comfy

I like the product because it is very comfortable and goes with a lot of clothing

Best shoes I have ever worn They are incredibly comfortable and I can not go without them I have tried other shoes but after a few weeks in they usually give me pains unless padded running shoes similar to ultra boosts Still even those shoes do not compare For a student athlete whose constantly moving from class to class with heavy books I can say this makes a difference in my life and takes away many foot pains I strongly recommend as running shoes or as lifestyle shoes for anyone who walks a lot They are expensive but 100 worth the purchase In terms of sizing I recommend going to the store to try on the size for you If they do not have them in stock or they do not have your specific color it is still good to know what your size is so you can order it online

AMAZING SHOE XTREMELY COMFORTABLE WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE

The shoe fits perfectly is extremely comfortable and the color wave is absolutely beautiful

I like it because it is comfortable go true to size but the boost and shoe are breaking apart and he boost is breaking that can be seen also it is breaking and very dirty easily that can be noticed

Great fit looks good with joggers and pants good cop

Very Comfortable and Great Looking Boosts Looks better then on picture

Look and conform unite as one and leave the others behind in the dust

I bought this for my boyfriend after his complaints of constant sole pain from other shoes A family recommended we buy this because of the comfort he experienced in wearing ultraboost We do not regret buying this He loves it

Order a half size up

Super bouncy Great look I order the mens 7 5 and am a woman9 Fit perfectly

Talk about comfort and feel This shoe has both Ultra boost rocks

This is my second pair of ultraboosts and it will not be my last As always these are very comfortable breathe well and the boost cushioning feels like walking on a cloud Cannot reccomend these shoes enough They are pricey but they are worth it

Not only have I fallen in love I have made family as well

comfort hits the spot quality leather cage materials

These shoes are very comfortable and fit me well love them

Unique cw better than previous Parley versions plus ultraboost bottom makes this sweet

Comfortable and great for running and other activities

Amazingly comfortable shoes and the black on black scheme works with most casual looks

Quality style and comfort 2ns time purchasing this same shoe

Very comfortable Flexible like the colors you can choose from

this is the second pair I have after I outgrew the previous ones very comfortable and can be worn all day

so comfy and they match certain outfits really well way to go

walking on the clouds

Own two pairs already Super comfortable sneakers great for gym Highly recommend

Ultra boost shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes i own I have these and the prime knits i think they are called and both are amazing I feel no difference with these being recycled plastics which only makes these shoes more appealing Overall great shoes will buy again

Went to pull laces tight to tie shoes and the laces broke the rubber holes Now only using the 6 holes to lace up so it is not as fitted at top of foot

I love the support I feel like I am walking on pillows

Mean look and comfort with these GOT Boost Really dig the leather cage

Love the shoe but it has glue all over the bottom

Great purchase Most comfortable shoes Great for going out and gym

This is my 2nd pair of Ultraboosts Extremely comfortable especially when standing for extended periods of time

Feels like I am on pillow very soft and great for running

One of the most comfortable running shoes I ever had

Without a doubt the comfiest pair of shoes I have ever owned Stylish and can walk on them for days without any discomfort Only thing I wish I could do is customize the colors 10 10

it is a cool shoe no doubt The attention to detail is great and the fire esque colorway will give you the pop you want in your wardrobe Premium materials Excellent comfort Perfect silhouette

The shoe overall is really comfortable and looks better compared to other running shoes if you plan on using them besides what they are meant for The quality is great and it has similar features from previous ultraboost versions which I like

The 3 0 UBwere the loosest of the primeknit and are supremely comfortable but going true to size may be too large I would recommend half size down if purchasing 3 0 TTS if 4 0

These are my favorite UBThe 2 0 UBto be specific because they are true to size and the primeknit is just rightnot as tight as 1 0 and 4 0 but not as loose as 3 0 Buy buy buy these

Very comfortable the size perfect I can wear this shoes all day without my feet hurting

The ultraboosts are a modern and sleek shoe for any occasion and well constructed The comfort lives up to the hype and I would recommend this item to anyone on the fence

ULTRA BOOST the only way to go So comfy and stylish

I do like the bottom Comfortable but I can not order width because not available even I order half size from what normally I do Still too tight after long day I wear it I feel To squeeze I hope they make them in width soon

Its looks nice and its comfortable the variety is really nice too

This is the 3rd pair but this pair is already wearing really bad on the tread The last 2 pair lasted about a year If this pair keeps wearing like this the will not last 6 monthThe price is high if they are not going to last

they are super comfy and the design looks really good

Super light and feels comfortable while running and for leisure

Lightweight comfortable and well made 1st adidas sneakers I have bought in over 10 years not gonna wait that long for my next pair

The boost technology is amazing for my morning runs

These are soooo nice I have never worn a more comfortable shoe in my life

Great shoes overall Looks great feel great Got a lot of compliments on them

Loved the material and wanted something comfortable Could easily walk miles all day and still be comfortable

Shoes are exactly as advertised Solid for walking

Amazing shoes I had been wanting them for awhile and finally bought them They are so comfy

Very comfortable beautiful colors glows in the dark

Getting an awesome shoe plus helping with the Ocean project at the same time cant go wrong with Parley

very comfortable shoes that can be worn all day Stylish and comfort cant be beat

Overpriced shoes that are comfortable and needs a wider toebox

I usually wear to gym Because of the light green color I should not use for jogging outside much but I do anyway WhyBecause I love the design Perfect for being lifestyle sneakers

The best purchase and most comfortable shoes I ever purchased

Most comfortable shoes to wear for someone who walks at least 4 hours in a fast paced environment

I like it but do not so much because of the amount of money

Love the fade from front to back The colors are really vibrant and perfectly match the black

The design is nice and simple A must buy for everyone

These shoes are extremely comfortable and look awesome

took the advice of many to go a half size down and they fit perfectly

Great for leisure wear and running Breathable shoes and colorway are cool

The shoes are very comfortable and quite stylish

Love it Shoe is the most comfortable adidas shoe I have worn

Just got the shoe and really love this Would love to see this color way on the regular low ultra boost

Best product from adidas line up Fits perfectly and comfortably

I always have difficulty finding a great reliable sneaker but I have found it in the Ultraboots These sneakers have changed the way I evaluate sneakers and I highly recommend getting a pair and feeling how great it is to walk run or exercise in them

i like it because the comfort and all white they look and feel great

Great sty easy to wear and look at would buy sgain

My 1st pair was my normal shoe size but since I have sort of wide feet and I wear thick socks they were just too narrow I returned them for a 1 2 size larger and NOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS ARE ALL ABOUT I never knew that running shoes could be this comfortable If you have wide feet then go up a 1 2 size the length is only a little longer for the good but the width is so much better Will be getting more ULTRABOOST shoes It will be hard to buy anything else

My feet really hard to buy a shoes cause I usally hurt my back feet and also some time my back get hurt cause I move to much for work After long years of many shoes then I tried with adidas I change my mind adidas help me no hurt my feet and my back anymore I really appreciated adidas

This is a great running shoe It is just as refined for running as any other UB It is very unique in design and the details are amazingany GoT fan will appreciate this The build quality is great and the attention to details is obvious These UBs are very comfortable and they are so unique I am a size 10 regular widthI usually wear size 10 5 for my running shoes I chose size 10 5 in this shoe and it fits fine for me I have worn them all day and I have run 5 miles in them with no issues The material may feel snug on your feet but it moves and flexes with your movement so your feet still breathe and there is zero discomfort This was a great purchase

I was going back and forth between sizes I am normally a 7 5 8 in womenand ordered a 7 and these were perfect The details are awesome and I believe this is a must have for GOT fans Combining both loves ultraboosts and GOT Really happy with my purchase

This UB in classic black goes with anything I like it very much it is size is just a little bit larger wider than normal but not sure you need to order 1 2 size smaller I wear size 11 5 and typically prefer loose fit

I bought a pair of Ultra boost shoes via the adidas website Ultra boosts typically are fairly expensive compared to other running shoes However IMHO are worth it They offer amazing comfort and bounce They give me an extra oomph on the treadmill and the gym Plus they look great just walking around town Love them

Amazing comfort size and width 10 10 would recommend

Bought this pair for my boyfriend not just because he is a GOT fan but because he is been experiencing foot muscle pains the past few weeks The boost technology helps alleviate a lot of that stress and pain in his foot allowing him to endure standing at work with a lot more ease than before He is especially into the GOT accents like the pull tab Overall Ultraboosts are always a win and the GOT collar is just a bonus

I recommend a 1 2 size bigger than what you wear Your feet breathe tremendously and the soles are very comfortable

Awesome shoe for run and style Possibly size down half size

I love this shoe so much it is super cool looking and really fresh I wear them with no show socks and the look is awesome Since buying my first pair of 3 0 two years ago I have purchased 7 other pairs and now have way too many to wear they are all so comfortable and super easy to be active in All the color options keep me coming back for another pair

Great shoe I get lots of compliments about the Game of Thrones

These shoes are high quality insanely comfortable and worth every penny you spend on them

Purchased this to help with my arthritic condition in my feet and ended up with 3 pair Raw Desert CORE BLACK CARBON ASH SILVER and Gray Three LOVE the sock like fit of this shoe

Really comfortable shoes that look really nice Definitely recommend

Very comfortable and lightweight Looks great and feels even better

Boost is Life I already have NMDs and some basketball shoes with boost and like them a lot After wearing the ultra boosts for a day the additional cushion is obvious it is like walking on clouds and I already thought the NMDs were good Ultra boosts take it up another level Toe box is a little tight and overall might be just a touch short Going to see how they break in Love them and need another colorway

Unbelievably comfortable grippy on wet surfaces and look fantastic

These are the greatest shoes i have ever had They are so comfortable and lightweight And they are a hypebeast Item so you know you be wearing the fresh kicks

needed new running shoes and got these They are perfect love the comfort and style

Nice color way perfect for the summer months The heel cup is different from most other Ultraboost shoes which is nice

My favorite running shoes Perfect fit So comfortable

Keep buying this shoes

The primeknit is so comfortable like it is in all ultra boost but the fleece lining on the inside makes it so much softer The leather and fleece make it look so much better and gives it a premium sort of look 10 10 Would Buy Again

This shoe is amazing I love game of thrones and had been thinking about getting a pair of ultra boost How fitting is it that my first pair would mean so much to me Love how comfortable the shoes are and love the GOT theme No detail missed

After reading numerous reviews about these shoes I would agree these are the most comfortable running shoes for every day wear They feel like I am wearing socks They provide excellent cushioning and the toe box area is wide enough to wiggle my toes while providing support

The Ultraboost is lightweight comfortable and breathes well

Great shoes and very comfortable Highly recommend

I am pleased that the white sidewall does not stain like the last few adidas shoes I have bought

The style fit and comfort bring me back every time

Can walk for days with this one and I hate walking lol

Comfortable shoe great for walking standing or running

I like this product because of the all white and it is super comfortable

This shoe is extremely comfortable I have tried several brands and styles and this shoe has done the job for both comfortability and appearance No barking dogs at the end of the day

The most comfortable casual shoe you can buy out there its okay for running and I mostly use for the office

Great shoes for daily use when you are on your feet a lot

I love the cushioning of the shoe but it definitely fits MUCH smaller than what I was lead to believe online Would recommend every guest buy 1 2 size larger than their normal size

I mean its GOT collection all the little details from the wolf to the fleece interior

Whats not to love about an ultraboostSpecially these parleys with everything its stand for Looks comfort and a great cause

Ultraboost are always great shoes These are the coolest ultraboosts so far I loved the alcantara trim

Love the combination of a leather cage ATR sole with a low top Ultraboost Purchased a pair for my girlfriend and I think it is her favorite Ultraboost now Definitely recommend

Very comfortable shoe overall though the fit is a little tight for my preference

I cannot say enough how much I love these sneakers I have the triple black 3 0and the blue 4 0 and they are constantly in my rotation along with my eqtAdidas keep making these dope colorways and I will be sure to buy more of these for sure

I dig how this shoe looks like it could be beat up worn hiking and still maintain great looks However since it has fleece lined uppers it is very warm and runs small I usually wear an 11 5 and a 12 fit perfectly

Its the best walking and running shoes ever best quality ideal for whole day wear

I just bought my last week the moment I tried it on was like I have been wearing it for a long time It is the only shoe that I try on without slipping at the back Buy them if you have not

The product is great but the box sent by Adidas clearly was a returned item and has been used Disappointed on not receiving an unopened box

It took me forever to decided for sure which pair I want I ordered the black and orange targaryens and the starks I received my starks today and can not stop looking at them I was nervous about the size I am normally a 9 in women ordered a size 8 and it is perfect Super comfortable also love the colors and the way they are put together Definitely worth it

They are a very comfortable pair of sneakers They are exactly as advertised

it is so comfortable to walk around with Literally bought 2 more pairs

I now own two pairs of these shoes Personally I have a wider foot so I went a half size up and they fit really well The only change I would make is adding more options as far as colors go The white part on the bottom gets dirty very easily and it is not the easiest to clean Overall this shoe is the very comfortable regardless if you are using them for running or just as a every day shoe

The shoe is comfortable convenient easy to use Love wearing these shoes

I absolutely love this shoe My back and legs do not hurt like they do with other shoes I want every pair

A really nice shoes but I just need change a size

Great shoe very comfortable After wearing I immediately went and bought another pair Also got this pair at a great price compared to full price

My children have big feet so the shoes fit them just fine

Great product for great price Will never buy any other shoe besides ultraboost

Fit perfectly Extremely comfy do not ware off fast Just a solid shoe

Good for everything Gym Comfort running love them

All i can say is that this collab with adidas and game of thrones is one of the best I love game of thrones and if you know already UB is a very good shoe Nothing much to say

Extremely comfortable and fashionable what is not to like

My shoe came with glue showing around plastic area It was disappointing i had to return it and it was a limited edition

it is not comfortable as i I would think It hurts and numb my foot after two hours of walking around in San Francisco I will not order again

These shoes are very comfortable for running Plenty of cushion for daily training

A company like Adidas doing what is right by the ocean today will be in business for a very long time My only wish is for an expanded product line using recycled plastics and a way to further the cycle by send products back when they are no longer usable

Great And super Comfortable Adidas is My New only shoes Ultra Boost

I love how comfortable it is Also they lood amazing on foot

Good shoes but little tight on the toes in the front

A must cop for all the GoT fans they look great

Very nice and comfortable and recommended this to everyone

Good quality materials and very confortable Best shoes i own

I really like the full primeknit upper and the boost is one of the best versions I have worn And I have tried Pureboost NMD EQT Yeezy 350 and others I prefer the feel of Ultraboost more than all of those Go true to size if you like a snug and secure fit They are about a half size small but the stretchy primeknit flexes as your foot does

Comfy great for dads not too flashy subtle wash friendly

Bold colors on this UBs would be nice if Adidas has more unique options

I love the way this shoe is built you feel the quality in the material and the fit Plus it is a very stylish shoe

Love the product I will recommend it to anyone that walks all day

The product is very handsome light responsive and very comfortable

Perfect fit and great color way Love this shoe very comfy

Coming as a new sneaker and a collection item you would think the box would come undamaged First thing I noticed was that one of the sides of the box was ripped and the nice Adidas GOT paper was ripped as well Instant negative vibes I do like the GOT touches they put into it Nights watch back tab tongue on the inside lace tips fleece inner lining and the GOT insole

this is one of the most comfty shoes i ever had Never regret buying this shoes

I have been looking at the Ultraboost for a while and glad I finally bought them They are definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I own which is important for my work where I stand 3 4 the day

I love the Ultraboost line for comfort and general simplicity of design So much sneaker athstetic is complex and unnecessary shapes colors and forms The Ultraboost 4 0 line is a simple modern design with unmatched comfort from any other brand that I have tried

really comfortable continental sole is much thicker on this than on regular boosts which is big

The size fits great and the comfort is next level

Great shoe style comfort performance Just love them

The sneakers look even better in person the quality is great and ultra boosts are always comfy

Everyone who loves game of thrones will love this shoe

The build quality and comfort on this thing is out of this world I would highly recommend to go up half a size as if I just bought my usual size it would have been waaaay to small

It looked even better than the picture nice balance in color too

It is very comfortable Definitely recommend Lives up to the ultraboost name

Got my third pair of Ultraboosts and I think they are some of the best shoes for casual wear They look sick and feel amazing Will be getting more

The color and its perfect to my feet and the style is so unique

This shoe is extremely comfortable and matches everything They are my go to

Wore it everyday to work No complains at all Especially if you are on the go these shoes will hold up

I wear these shoes every day standing at work and my feet never hurt

Very comfortable and provides energy back just waiting to see the durability

Shoes were a perfect fit and the comfort level exceeded my expectations

I think that this shoe is very comfortable but there isnt great airation within the shoe

This shoe is beautiful in appearance and performance Cannot say anything negative about Have already logged over 70 miles on this shoe and it is comfort perfection Plus all the questions I get about this shoe from friends because this shoe with the copper heal just truly stands out

everybody already knows the ultraboosts are one of if not the comfiest shoes on the market The GoT colorways are amazing and have very unique touches if you are up to date with the show Amazing

The materials an color on these shoes are great This collaboration with GOT was great

Shoes were dirty in some spots were not wrapped in tissue and tag was lying in the box not attached to the shoes

Style and design are second to none I love Parley

very comfortable nice color very good look they complete the look

 xc3 xbaper quality and extremely comfortable Perfect for work

Adidas ultra boost are super comfortable shoes They look great and can be work anywhere Wether it is to working outb or for casual wear I love it

Comfortable stays tied and looks better than any other shoe on the market

I have to say I really liked the Night Watch version of the GOT Ultraboost collab This version takes my two favorite shoes which are the Ultraboost and the Ultraboost ATE and combined them into one The material seems thicker on this shoes and the leather cage the fleece lining makes the shoes looks more premium The ATE out sole looks rugged and should provide good traction in wet weather while for sure will last longer than the regular version I also love the black white contrast of the shoe While the colorway definitely do not pop as the some of the other version this is definitely the easiest one to wear on the daily basis Highly Recommend it

Design is really nice with the dragon flame effect across the upper looks great Lots of nice touches from the House Targaryen logo at the back of the lip to the Fire and Blood tag in the back and the house name on the laces Really comfortable since it uses ultraboost tech

Honestly love Ultraboosts and these did not disappoint They are so comfortable to walk in and the design is even better in person than online

Navy Blue and the white contact really well as well as helping the environment makes it a great show On top of all that it is an ultraboost

This is for all the GOT fans Team Targaryen Great shoes fits and feels nice But could have made the packaging a little more nicer since this is a limited edition

I love the way these just mold into my feet Shoelaces really are not required I could go untied and never worry about them slipping off or even coming off my heel The black looks so sleek I love these shoes

Would buy it again for friendo i am a big fan of got

Already a fan of the Ultraboost The Game of Thrones limited edition is a big plus and it retails at the normal Ultraboost price

My first pair of Ultraboostand by far one of my favorite purchases of the year Being a big fan of Game of Thrones I get shouts when I am out wearing them are those the TargaryansGreat purchase recommend 100

Game Of Thrones fan and love the colors of the shoes

Never disappointed with Ultraboosts They are always so comfortable and the GOT addition makes it even better

this game of thrones color way is straight fire

These Game of Thrones House of Targaryen shoes are the essence of style Totally in love with the stylish red mesh upper with the black accents Would have given a perfect score but for the unisex sizing I find the arch support better in the Ultraboost Womenshoe and wish they had been offered in menand womensizing That being said I usually wear a 10 and 1 2 in womenand ordered this shoe in an 8 and 1 2 and found the fit to be perfect The size chart indicated that I should order 1 size down from my usual 10 1 2 womensize but 2 sizes down was right for me Great style and great shoe

The attention to detail on this colorway is without a doubt impeccable The mixture of red orange and yellow to give the fire breath look is stunning I love the little touches of orange to give off the impression of embers Adidas and GOT knocked it out of the part with this collab Keep this up Adidas and I will keep throwing money your way

Been wearing adidas size 10 for years This size 10 is really a size 8 Fitment is poor

Super comfy I love the style looks amazing I can wear these every day

Every shoe company should make a wide version shoe Maybe they could do it in the especially popular sizes 10 11 5That would be really cool Adidas I would buy a second pair if they did this

if you like game of thrones and want a sweet looking shoe

The torsion system kinda goes through the sole and makes a bump in the sole Otherwise great shoes

I love this brand And this shoes was very comfortable

The best running shoe there is They feel and look great by far my favs

It looks great and feels amazing on foot Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

I usually have to stand for a couple hours a day and these keep my feet nice and cushy

Great shoe and design Comfortable to say the least with boost sole

Best colorway You can not go wrong with triple white

These are the best Wish they had more options with all black soles but still love them

Very comfortable shoe I get compliments often on them often My extremely wide foot makes the inner cage support pieces stick out of the upper but it is not very noticeable and does not impact comfort

Quality materials on the Ultraboost gold medal edition They did not skimp on this one Great look and great comfort

This shoe is so comfortable and is the perfect combination of style and performance

very comfortable shoe I highly recommend if you have been contemplating on this purchase

Beautiful and comfortable best ever shoes thank you adidas

Needed a size up The shoes feel like the cloth is going to rip soon and I have only been wearing them for 2 weeks

This is the most comfortable shoe ever Love the color and it is well made Love Boost

Comfortabale on another level They look amazing they give the modern look However wearing it for long time might be a pain if their tighted up all the time that should make sense

Great shoe great quality true to size but a bit narrow go up half a size up and you will be good Will buy more colorways soon

I just love ultraboost it xc2 xb4s the best thing since Running Shoes

I absolutely love these shoes this is my third pair of ultraboosts I wear them out with jeans to the gym and during my 12 hour night shifts at the hospital I have never worn a more comfortable shoe

Shoe looked amazing and comfortable but it was too small I will try getting maybe half size or one size bigger when it is back to stock

After wearing these shoes when on my feet for 12 hours straight me feet have never felt so good

it is the perfect shoe because it fits every need The comfort is next level

comfortable with just enough support great everyday walking shoes definitely worth it

need to take care not to dirty very white but very comfortable and breathable

Very light perfect for running and classy look Must recommend if you do long run

This is my third pair of ultraboost and I love them But this pair felt a little too big

This UB 2 0 are very comfortable but unlike 1 0 they seem to run a little slim on the with department I have to go 1 2 size up to be able to fit comfortable

I liked the shoe because it brought a light vibe in my outfit

Like the style of Shoe Looks great on feet only con wish I had went a half size up There a little narrow in the toe box

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever wore

Ultraboost as usual are very comfortable The only minus is the cage is a little snug unless loosely laced

All the other reviews are correct Get a 1 2 size bigger and you will be good

Very comfortable great lifestyle sneaker looks nice and fits perfectlyboostforlife

Sizes and color were readily available and shipped within 2 days can not wait to buy a 2nd pair

Highly recommended this ultra boost shoes It is comfortable and can walk for a long distance without feet aching

looks suave fresh and confident my Superstar track suit Getting compliments the comfort is life changing we will see when Spring arrives how much better they perform when I run

Ultraboost remain the most comfortable shoe to me The white and all black go with everything

I heard a lot of good things about the Ultraboost I finally decided to get a pair and they are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes My feet are happy

Love the color and comfort Great details and concept

First pair I purchased Easy to get on and off Looks and feels great

I have been wearing these Ultraboost on a vacation trip in which a lot of walking was involved These shoes are stylish and yet extremely comfortable to walk in The trip convinced me to pick up a couple more pairs just because they work so extremely well

My so a favorite running shoes to date He is really hard on his shoes so really I should review in a few months

The comfort will blow you away

Fits and feel like a fine leather glove with a cloud like cushion Most comfortable shoes I have ever had My one complaint is the white soles They tend to absorb some types of soil especially clay It is impossible to get the sole back to its original white color It looks very dirty very quickly I have to spend extra time with these shoes trying to get the soles to look clean and they never look really sharp after a few wears

Great fit and looks great Only downside is how perforated they are

need more colors to select from in my size also woudllike ot see more 1 2 sizes at 12 5 and 13

Great colorway So comfy Hard to wear any other shoes after these

Great shoes that can be used for running and look good too

I LOVE these UltraBoost The colorway is amazing and as with all UltraBoost the comfort is like no other shoe on the market With these and all 1 0 and 2 0 models I recommend a half size larger than the 3 0 and 4 0 UBs YMMV

Boost is life for me I literally gave up all of my other shoes just to stocked up on 2 pairs of ultra Boost everything they say about them is true I Will say this if you have a job that requires you to stand for 8 hours or more I had little bit of discomfort other than that their amazingBoost Is Life

Great shoes I would recommend to anybody best shoes I have ever bought

These shoes are very comfortable I highly recommend these shoes

You know these shoes are awesome and so do I now Look awesome feel awesome

matches with anything and the colorway is nice

Great running gear This confirms my commitment to adidas

The fit was a bit small but the shoe itself is super clean and very comfortable

I just received these yesterday and I love them I ordered a half size up and I am glad I did They fit perfect and are so comfortable I wore these last night for cross training and they were perfect Definitely recommend

Shoes fits as I expected Super comfy can walk for hours in them without any discomfort Would highly recommend

it is a lightweight comfortable shoe I went half a size smaller and the fit is perfect

I am a big fan of the 4 0 ultraboost so when this color came out I knew I needed to add it to my collection Definitely need to go a half size up as they run short

First time owning a pair Adidas very comfortable and stylish I like them went to store to buy some pants and top to go with my Adidas

Would buy a different color the most comfortable shoes ive worn

I absolutely love the ultraboost Best shoe on the market

Really nice and very comfortable shoes I definitely recommend buying them

My son loves these shoes and said they have style and comfort

This is my first pair of caged Ultraboosts and they are phenomenal I have only had uncaged pairs before and while they both have the same ultra boost sole these caged models 1 up them on the convenience factor for putting them on I have always been a fan of the Parley collaboration with Adidas and was very pleased with how the color way on this model looks in person Definitely looking forward to when I can get another pair

Do not like the BOOST in sole coming out every time I take off my shoes Surely we can do better than this 

This shoe is super comfortable and the boost is the best part I would go a half size up for these

I like the design and the use of white with some pastel colors but the colors are not overbearingsimple and clean Appreciate you designed this so that the insole could be removed to allow for different insoles

comfortable toon my foot and the material use was excellent

it is very comfortable However I noticed a small defect

Ultraboost in general are really good shoes There so comfortable and the quality is amazing just order a half size bigger

I have found with UBI need to go up a half size usually but I love the color and wear them with black joggers all the time Would recommend just size up

This shoe is by far the best running shoe i have ever owned I am proud to run in this everyday Honestly the boost foam technology has improved my run time It made me faster and also got rid of my shin splints I will never use any other shoe ever again Boost for life The ultraboost runs half a size small though so might wanna up half a size But overall its perfect From the minimalist upper that provides maximum comfort its like hugging your feet to the ultra responsive boost sole that improves every strike this shoe is an 11 10

Support comfort style The available colors are top of the line

Perfect shoes Comfort stability stylish Thank you so much Adidas Will be ordering another pair in black

I have had these shoes for a little over 3 months and the boost on the bottom of the shoe is starting to split around the ball of my foot The interior lining on the back of the heel already has holes in it and I have about worn a hole in the green insole They are super comfortable as all ultraboosts are but the quality on the pair I got is absolute trash

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Definitely worth the purchase

I have worn energy boost shoes since2012 and I loved the tight narrow sock fit I wore them without socks and they fit will and didnt chafe at all

I wanted to get back into running but other shoes I tried did not reduce impact These however have a very comfortable land Downside the knit on top does get quite dirty even within the first few days of use and I am unsure of the efficiency of washing them

The shoe fits extremely well I think its a little wide but still fits evenly well I work out in mine Hoop in mine and have not had a single issue yet highly recommend these awesome shoes

Do not know why Ultra Boosts do not fit uniformly All black colorways seem to be more narrow Need to fit more consistently across all colorways so buyer can take the guesswork out of buying on line

Due to the material of these shoes cleaning is difficult as they cannot be put into the washing machine

No tongue and can just slip on and off to the gym

Very comfortable but need better color choices for future purchases

a perfect everyday shoe most comfortable shoe i have ever owned however it is better for lifestyle wear than running or working out because it is not the most supportive shoe

Supportive and looks good with anything I have a hard time running in shoes without my feet hurting and these truly feel like clouds on my feet

they are nice clean shoe Very comfortable 3rd pair all very good shoes

The quality of the Ultra Boost has deteriorated significantly over the years The stitching between the two shoes was off and the fit was very awkward and tight I have owned all four versions of this sneaker and the 4 0 fit very small and narrow compared to the others Go a half size up AT LEAST

They are extremely comfortable They can be used for many things like running or playing soccer and are overall a great shoe

I am on my feet for 8 hours a day and they provide great support

Very comfortable pair of athletic shoes they stay in place and support your feet

Incredibly comfortable I weigh between 220 and 250 depending on the year and can run for days in these I have purchased multiple pairs because they are so good They fit a little snug at first and the base can be a little narrow but for the most part fit true to size

I like the boost and the comfort that it provides the ultra boost Are a stem up in comfort from the nods giving a little more support and comfort over all they are both great shoes and I have 5 pairs of each she

Bought them as casual shoes turned into my go to workout running kicks They are unbelievably lightweight and the comfort is unmatched Now if I could find those nights watch black thangs you dropped we would be in business

The boost mid is incredibly comfortable and the prime knit upper is very breathable Seems to run small I had to go up a 1 2 size

The primeknit boost is so comfortable and the colorway is awesome

Great shoes Definitely reccomend Very soft cushion

Good overall shoes fit and quality Price is on the high side though

I like the product but needed to return it because it was too small

I love my pure boost Near perfect but I feel the lack of insole makes the shoe a little too firm The Ultraboost has great cushioning but is way way way too narrow I wear a 10 normally I have to get a 11 5 I do not have a wide foot but its so tight that the plastic sides start digging into my foot if I wear my normal size

this is another great comfortable shoe with boost and a soft upper material

Although these are pricy they are worth the money in my opinion I ordered these as a present for my fianc xc3 xa9 but I own a ladies pair and wear them everyday and LOVE them My fianc xc3 xa9 works on his feet all day and wears his at work too So comfortable They do break in a tiny bit so do not be worried if they feel a little snug at first

Most comfortable shoes Adidas makes I have multiple pair

it is a great product Very comfortable Looks good with shorts and pants

Worth the amount and worth the experience and suitable for running

The shoes did not seem as comfortable at first as I had high expectations for them but after a couple of uses they seemed to become more comfortable

I have over 4 pairs because it is the most comfortable ever

So far great for the gym

The shoes tend to be narrow a little hard to put in the feet although I alreay ordered 1 2 size larger Shoes are very comfortable and perfect for running or walking

These are so comfortable could be just a little cheaper

Prefer the comfort of the Parleys over the regular ultraboost I own ultraboosts and the parleys are my favorite They feel the most snug and I still went a 1 2 size up

I ordered a 10 they are too small for me A 10 5 would fit Ive never worn a 10 5 before Wish I kept the box to return for bigger size Its a lot of money for a shoe that is too small to be comfortable

Very durable and beautiful sneaker Color and style are perfect

I love these shoes They are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in my life

I own many pairs of Adidas shoes and this is the first pair of Ultraboost I have purchased They are without doubt the best Adidas shoes I have ever owned

So people ask about size but i say true to size i wear a size 9 5 in my circle knit nmd r2 normal nmd not the pk and i got a 9 5 in this i gotta say it fits good I like my shoes snug but with a little toe room and this really works If i had gone a half size down id be right at the tip and that plastic toe guard would be a little annoying very comfy midsole thi

I love the aesthetic feel of the shoes but they run a size to small I bought an 11 but their too tight on me and hurt my foot

Sizing is about a half size to a full size too small For that reason I bought a size up Otherwise perfect for the gym A lot more support than my NMDs which was needed NMDs are still the most all around most comfortable everyday shoe but needed more support for running at the gym Love this shoe

I definately recommend this product

I stand on a concrete floor for 10 hours a day at work I have tried dozens of different shoes for all day standing comfort and nothing else comes close If you stand all day and work in a relatively clean environment and you are looking for the most comfortable shoe you can get look no further This is definitely the one

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

I have been wearing them for a month on a daily basis I have only used them for casual walking no running but they are holding up excellent and are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

It is super comfortable and the quality on these shoes is amazing

Everythingfine but except for the sole had a little yellow color on it

I got my first pair of ultraboost in november 2018 since then I have got me 5 pairs I replaced pretty much all my shoes for ultraboost solarboost or nmd Boost is just out of the league

My son loves them it is 2nd pair of same shoes for him

It is comfortable Shoes runs little bit small so recommend to wear half size up

Great shoe very comfortable nice design highly recommended

Comfortable and looks great The shoes feel great and when in them all day

I liked the product Stylish and comfortable The material is thin so I would becareful because they could rip

Feels great and is very comfortable especially because I have flat feet

Comfortable and great look Love the design and quality

The ultra boost cushioning is easy to feel compared to other shoes

The shoes are very comfortable and quality is great

The Adidas UltraBOOSTs are the most comfortable shoes I have purchased The Boost technology provides the best cushioning in a running shoe today As for the sizing they are mostly true to size The color schemes that Adidas offers in the UltraBOOSTs are always on point

Shoes were super comfy and great overall loved them

One of the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

Shoes arrived and are very comfortable Probably most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I wish they came slightly wider as I have wide feet but nevertheless they are a great pair of shoes

I bought these shoes for my friend since she had worn out shoes so I bought her these and she does not want to go back to any other shoe

Going a half a size up is the way to go with these amazing show

The shoes I got not only look beautiful they also are so comfortable I can wear them and be on my feet all week

I love urltra boost they are the best shoe out there

I usually wear a 9 5 but got a 10 on this and it fits comfortably I have spent long hours running and standing on these and they are comfortable aired and overall a great shoe

Great shoes I own several pairs and will continue to purchase them

comfort and quality is amazing Perfect for running and working out

Very comfortable shoe that breathes quiet nicely Love the colors and that it is a shoe made out of recycled water bottle found in the beach Great running and lifestyle show

I am on my feet all day and my kids enjoyed the comfort of the Solar Boost I tried the shoes but they are way too narrow and run small

Like the looks and they are comfortable The run small so buy the next size up If you have narrow feet you will be fine but my feet are normal width so they feel snug but wearable

Very comfortable and stylish and looks great on True to your normal size

I usually wear an 11 5 but decided to go up 5 a size and get a 12 and even that is pretty close to tight I would say go for ONE size up from what you usually wear

Great quality shoe and very sleek looking Would definitely recommend

Simply awesome Quality comfort style It has it all

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Never had a blister

As everyone already knows the comfort is a 10 Style to match would highly recommend

Running long distance in these may not he very good on the joints as they lack some support But for track season im sure they are going to be perfect Style wise they look great and I can already tell they are extremely durable Im proud to wear and represent Adidas

I am a true 13 I should have bought a 14 they fit as long as I take the insoles out

This product is very comfortable but the size is running a bit small It would be perfect if the shoes are 1 2 size bigger

High quality and great fit Looks good with almost anything and can tell they are going to last a while

Love these shoes Super comfortable and great for the gym

The shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Very comfortable for ever day use running walking errands Worth the money

Missed out on the original release so I am glad they brought these back The best part of these shoes is the Multicolor knit Looking down at these shoes is really awesome just cause the colors on these really pop You might have to break these in first as my pair felt really tight However give it a few wears and it will fit much better Really wish these came with a red outsole to make this a perfect shoe

More structural support than my previous pair of ultra boost and even lighter

Heaven delivered these shoes down on us Boost is like walking on soft angelic clouds

Comfort is key You like walking on clouds then Adidas Ultra Boost is for you Feels like angels carrying you everywhere you go

I wear a size 9 5 in every other shoe brand This shoe feels like it is a full size too big The fabric also has started to come apart after 1 week

Comfortable as it gets stylish and long lasting can not get any better

A very good pair of ultraboosts Fits a little too small

Hope customer service can make this right I am a huge ultra boost advocate

The plastic things Adidas stripes make the sides of the shoes tight Otherwise no other complaints

Ultraboost are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever had For some reason this particular 4 0 in the core black white midsole does run a 1 2 size smaller compared to my other 4 0 Ultraboost in the turquoise black colorway I have wide feet and wear a EEE in dress shoes As soon as I removed the insole these black Ultraboost fit perfectly

Comfort style fit Can be worn either in the gym to run or casual shoe you all be in comfort no matter which you use for

Light and comfortable with excellent shock absorption

Super confortable Hard to keep them clean since they are white Would buy again

Yassss Queen Like OMG I can not even with this shoe it is just like walking on clouds then boom sike it is ultra boost

My favorite shoe

I bought these for my mom and she loved them She asked me to buy 2 more pairs

Feels like a sock and extremely comfortable The cushion on impact feels like a cloud These shoes makes running a joy

Awesome They look amazing and they are very comfortable

The product is really great Super comfortable and fits my foot nicely Definitely a must buy

I owned a pair previously and like it so much had to get another pair

Great shoe for walking or running around all day they are light and have good grip for most conditions

good shoesizing slightly off from Adidas typical

The adidas shoe is very comfortable and looks great on

Great quality and comfortable shoes would definitely recommend

Looks very nice but feels like cheaper shoes from other brands

Great shoe I would buy again Great color Very comfy

GOAT of shoes Ultraboost are the most comfortable shoes ever Have 10 pair

Nothing in my opinion beats the ultras They last 2 3x longer than most other running shoes I prefer these to the uncaged to have a little more mid foot support less sliding around

Very comfortable and extremely versatile do not wear in rain

Very nice and comfortable love the fit and the color Highly recommend

A little tight for the top of your foot kinda gives in a little more pressure due the the upper inner sponge jutting out but others still a really good shoe

I understand why this has become such a popular casual sneaker built for all day comfort and the knot is a great quality

Extremely comfortable for all day wear with cool factor

Very stylish and classic at the same time the comfort is defiantly there since being boost and matching it with your clothes is not a problem when its time to get ready for what every activity

Feels like walking on clouds and i wear them everyday

Super comfortable looks great seems to be very durable

One of the best shoes you can purchase look amazing with any combination of clothes 10 10 recommend

Excellent fit and very comfortable Great support

Super comfortable recommend go 1 2 size up delivery slow

The shoes are Very comfortable they fit great And they are very light and good with running

Comfortable sneakers Too narrow across the top Run a little small

This was a great birthday present that my boyfriend loved I wanted to get them in my size as well

The comfort of the shoes are great The price is high but you get a good shoe

Like walking on a cloud Super comfortable True to size

Very comfortable soft and lightweight You can pair it your jeans and casual attire

Really comfortable runs small if you normally use 11 like me buy 11 5 The side band on one of the shoes had some scratches by the first week of use which is a shame But overall great purchase

Great for those with lower back pain I wear these shoes everywhere and for everything

Can wear all day and stylish Glad I bought Thank you adidas

They fit really well and are super comfy it is cold where I am from and they also keep my feet warm

loved it very good shoe felt really great nice shoe

Totally worth it

I really like the soft knit material the shoe is made out of

Great look and comfort Highly recommend for working out or if you are on your feet a lot for work

These are the best shoes in the world You need to buy a pair

can not go wrong buying a white pair of Ultraboost should have sized up but I needed a pair for school These will do

the shoes cause heel pain in my foot that radiates up the leg

These are great shoe I brought them for my girlfriend who is a nurse so she is on her feet all night and she loves them the comfort is amazing for all nurses this is the shoe for you

These are incredibly comfortable shoes They do run about a half size too small but they feel great

I usually buy cheaper shoes but these are worth every penny

I love these light weight shoes and they are very stylish

I love the ultraboost great looking shoe very comfortable Service was great shipping was fast love adidas

it is a super comfortable shoe and I will definitely buy another pair could be a little wider of a shoe though

YOU CAN BUY THIS ULTRABOOST WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED ADIDAS PERFECTED THEIR BOOST OVER THE YEARS AND CAME UP WITH THIS PERFECT ULTRABOOST

I was astonished after lacing these bad boys up and walking around for several hours Your heel slips right into this cradled space that hugs your foot in an amazing way These shoes feel like they were made for my feet and my feet only The insane cushion they provide is something you will not understand until you put them on You will not want to take them off The fit is so forgiving as well Go with your gut on sizing and youu all be golden I wear a 10 10 1 2 and I went with a 10 1 2 no complaints whatsoever Even if I would have ordered a 10 they still would have fit perfectly The cage and lace system is genius and provides SO much stability with a knit shoe unlike the competitors I did not purchase these for work but I work for 12 13 hours a day walking and standing on nothing but concrete floors I started wearing them to work and I actually like my job more now that I have got these shoes because they take so much of the fatigue out of working I will be buying many more for different purposes I run in them as well and they still blow my mind In terms of the future of Ultra Boosts I hope to see endless color ways and a wide array of unique materials used just to maintain relevance in the style department Buy them now and youu all be thrilled you did

Best shoes ever very comfortable Web purchase was pretty simple to use

Vet comfortable and stylish It may be half a size too small for those with wider feet so keep this in mind during your purchase Other than that awesome shoe

I have never owned a pair of Ultra Boost before but when I purchased them I was so eager to receive them As soon as they came I unboxed them and tried them on No wonder everyone were calling them the next big thing and even if they are not as mainstream as they used to be I do not care because they are more than worth it I also recommend going true to size for the best fit unless you want something a bit loose at the toe front then you should go up half a size

The shoes are great I do not recommend for all day wear as the sole of your foot begins to hurt

The Adidas Boost are extremely comfortable and look great too

A great looking shoe and it is super comfy feels like walking on clouds

This shoe was perfect It was exactly what I expected and held up wonderfully

Comfy shoes for working on concrete 8 12 hours a day

I love these shoes Just be aware I found in the shoe the material holding the laces will break if you tie your shoe tight Not a big deal just need aware of it Honestly the best running shoes I have owned

I love how comfortable the shoe is you can not get better comfort for the price Not a paid reviewer

Sizing is off A little tight at toe Could be wider

its very comfortable and very breathable and its a great overall performance shoes

The iridescent heelcup with the Cotten candy laces make the shoe really stand out when you wear them

Love the shoe very comfortable I would recommend it to everyone

Environment friendly Stylish Comfortable ultrboost Feels a little uncomfortable in one foot Maybe it have to be broken into

The best performance shoe out there Worth the money

Its a very nice shoe I own 4 pairs of ultra boosts and they are all great

Very comfortable durable and well made The colors are awesome and they are super cool

Great shoes Have them for the entire family Highly recommend

This is my fourth pair of ultra boost Why do I comeback for another pairBecause they are awesome I use this pair strictly for running and they rock My retired pair had around 500 miles and it was time to say goodbye can not wait for cold weather to break so I put these through the ringer thank you Adidas

Comfortable fashionable and can not beat the price I bought them for

it is really comfortable I love it I wear them everywhere i go

The UltraBoost is true to fit and by far the most comfortable shoe

These are the most comfortable shoes I have wore but they have gotten dirty so I recommend Crep Protect

Great look unmatched fit and finish and the killer ultra boost feel love them

One of the best ultraboost to be made thus far

I liked this product because it fits exactly my size and provides very confortable walking and running sessions

The shoes are comfortable and they feel very durable My only issue with the shoe is that they do not have a tongue so it feels like my foot will come out of the shoe but it doesnt actually because the laces do secure my foot tightly enough weird feeling The shoes also have that adidas style that i enjoy ON A SIDE NOTE if you have a dog that sheds the soles are a magnet to the hair

Comfort The ultra boost is one of the best adidas shoes ever made

The shoes look very nicee but are probably the most uncomfortable I have ever had Way too narrow Ugh so disappointed since I had heard great things

The Adidas Ultra Boost has always been a popular choice for sneakerheads amateurs and runners This shoe continues to impress with its perfect materials and construction The primeknit is really comfortable and the boost provides exceptional cushioning The Continental rubber outsole is the finishing touch providing excellent traction on almost every type of surface except for basketball courts I would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone except people with wide feet It is totally worth that money

Running walking or sleeping Ultraboost are the way to go

Very comfortable shoe Just make sure to get half a size bigger than your usual size

Great shoe but wish I went a 1 2 size up They are definitely more comfortable than what is offered by their competition Highly recommend these shoes for running and casual use

The shoe is good quality and durable but definitely order one or even two sizes up it runs small

Very comfortable shoe i will buy another pair A must have shoe

They fit my foot well they feel secure they do not feel tight

The shoes are bought for my son He like it very much it is really comfortable

The quality seems to have gotten better This can be shown through the fact that the soles of the shoes do not come out when you take off your shoes

Bought these for my mom and she is obsessed with Ultra Boost now just like I am

To sum up this is in my opinion the most comfortable shoe ever made

I have always wanted a pair a ultraboosts and now that I have them I will def buy more pairs

Put plastic bags inside new Ultraboost to see if I can widen it a bit

I love the design how it is a white mesh on the outside with a baby blue undercover It has the comfort of ultra boost and feels like air walking Another quality buy

The shoes are really comfortable they look nice and fit nicely too

Quality weightless comfortable and good wear expensive

The shoe fits well and is very comfortable although I would recommend getting a half size up

They look cool fit great and are perfect for track

My son is ridiculously particular about shoes and it seems we are always buying a new pair so far he has been happiest with these so thank you And they were delivered soooo quickly

Great product fits firm to foot breathes well and lightweight

I love the product because of how comfy it is and at the same how good it looks with some of my outfits

These shoes are exactly what everyone else is saying very comfortable and very stylish They provide excellent support and cushion If you do not already own them you need a pair

Thanks Great Sneaker Second pair for college student

Best shoe I have ever purchased First time Ultraboost purchase and I will never go back Will get more color ways

Super comfortable great color and fit I have wide feet in womens 7 5 Best shoe i ever had Never going to wear any other shoes only ultraboost from now on

Very comfortable shoe that has great balance Works best for long walks and runs as the support is very good

They are good but run an half size too small They are really comfortable too

the shipment is really fast and the earlier comment is really helpful because this shoe is a little bit smaller so you would better buy a half size bigger one

Very comfortable Were delivered with a stain mark on the right foot upper I did not have the time to return them prior to needing to wear them Other than that they have been perfect

The ultraboost shoes are wonderful Can wear it all day The primeknit is being sturdy and love the style True to size Adidas shipping needs to be improved

just like the ultra boost shoe the look and fit be nice if price was a little better

They are very comfortable and you can walk with them for a long time Their quality is very good and they are very expensive bur worth it

So comfortable easy to run in order half size larger

Perfect for lounge wear active and everyday lifestyle

My first all white pair were a womens 8 and I typically where a 9 but they fit perfectly they had the clear 3 stripes and got super dirty tried to bleach them and they turned yellow Had them for well over a year

The sneakers are comfortable But the heel cup and adidas cage scratches easily

Would recommend for a person to buy because it is an amazing shoe that is comfortable and is worth to pay the price

Several reviewers voiced concern over Ultraboost shoes either being too small too narrow or both Many have suggested going up at least 1 2 size I disagree I have dozens of Adidas shoes in my collection and have been a long time customer of Adidas com I digested the chatter however and purchased both a size 12 5 my usual size and size 13 Going up 1 2 size was totally unnecessary for me as my usual size 12 5 fit perfectly No complaints Ultraboost are most comfortable athletic shoes I now own I would be curious as to whether or not those reviewers who voiced complaint on size or width are regular Adidas customers or new to the brand

This is a purchase well worth it Running shoe technology taken to another level

They look great and feel amazing i love these shoe Gunu buy a few more pairs

Style and fit was exactly what I was hoping for from adidas

I love these shoes and the color way I am considering getting a second pair

Very comfortable and it is a true fit I like the look and feel of the shoe

Had to order a whole size up for the shoe to fit But extremely comfortable

Most comfortable sneaker ever hands down plain and period

I disliked the style of the shoes at first but I saw some in real life and instantly was in aw I ordered them online and they fit true to size and I am not kidding when I say these are seriously one of the BEST pairs of shoes I have ever worn they are stylish durable and comfy for walking standing all day

they were a grand purchase the shoes are very comfortable

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I own Definitely will be getting some more

Love boost tech but the sock liner was not the best for my foot Recent nerve pain makes the ultra boost a little uncomfortable

I like the style and the comfort the shoe gives me

I bought these for my grandson and he thinks they are awesome

I do not run in them but they are are insanely comfortable throughout the day

Such good shoes that I would recommend to anyone looking for amazing comfort

Bought a pair for both of my sons ages 19 and 27 and they stated the shoes are very light and comfortable Good well made shoe and great for running

Great Quality and Stylish Boost family are the best

it is comfortable I like walking on clouds they look good

Ultraboosts are immediately comfortable and even better as you break them in My favorite shoe so far

As an avid shoe collector for the past 20 years you will not find a better quality shoes for comfort I find myself not gravitating towards anything adidas puts out compares to other brands Highly recommended

Entry point is too narrow can not get my foot in the sneaker

This shoe is very comfortable totally reccomend it

Hesitant to buy these at first but glad I did Really comfortable shoes

AAAAAA

Great for exercise I love these shoes for running

it is extremely comfortable and looks good on foot

Cool color super comfortable shoes that breathe very well

Quality is amazing Shoes are comfortable and offer great support

Very comfortable but they run a little small Would recommend get a half size larger than you normally would

Way too small Need to order one full size up Very disappointed that Adidas can be so misleading on the sizing

The white is so clean and the shoe is incredibly comfortable I want more

Very comfy that go great with everything Feels like your walking on clouds every step

These shoes are a perfect fit and are crazy comfortable Will definitely be buying other colors

Super comfy stylish and fits with a lot of outfits

I like them because they are quiet and they look cool

I could not be more pleased This is my third pair of boosts The only shoe that lasts for more than a year on hospital floors day in and day out

pretty comfortable shoes feels great once broken into for my running

Comfort and value

Probably the most comfortable shoes I have put on my feet in a long time and it looks cool

They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had

A gift for my sister Sick shoes The gray color looks clean it goes with everything

I purchased due to the unique color of the fabric Super comfortable

I love these super fresh all whites So comfortable I can not take them off

Not true to normal size Opening of shoe too small to easily put the shoe on

The shoe is highly comfterble and easy to slip on and really worth the price and I am definatly going to buy another pair in the future

Omg these shoes are the most comfortable pair of running shoes ever

The shoes seem run a half size smaller since it is a narrow shoe However extremely comfortable

Very comfortable and worth the money Would buy again

they are so comfortable Recommend to everyone

First of all I love the design it is very light weigh it goes well with pretty much every outfit I wear and my entire family owns a pair

I love the comfort on this shoe it is the best thing to ever touch my feet

The midsole is the best technology on the sneaker market right now and the upper is streatchy and very breathable The ankle padding is insanely soft improved from the previous ultra boost its a shoe that when you wear it you do not want to take it off that is how comfortable the Adidas Ultra Boost 4 0 actually is

My son loves these shoes and is happy with his purchase He says they are very comfortable and supportive They do run about a 1 2 size too small We will see if the toes wear out the tips over time

Footwear is light yet durable Best all around workout running shoe to date

Most comfortable shoe I have bought I wear them almost everyday cause they are stylish and feel really nice

Simple yet very pleasing to the eye but so comfortable and can wear with anything

I love it because the boost conforms to my feet when I walk but the boost gets very dirty

I love the way the shoes look fit and feel when wearing them

Wore them out significantly on first two runs unfortunately

These are really the best shoes ever so comfortable Bought them for my brother for Christmas and he loves them

It is a good good good shoe I would recommend to my buds

How comfortable it is and the Spring back it gives when running

Everything about it was just perfect I would recommend to all my friends

The boost midsole is incredible it is soft yet responsive as advertised No worry of popping the cushioning system like the other brand The PK is light and breathable so your feet do not get as soggy after a hard workout Only gripe is that you must immediately clean the outer midsole after use so that it does not stain from the dirt dust that your shoes pick up And the price is pretty steep

Very comfortable and well cushioned run My last pair was the Adidas Ultrabounce which was a nice shoe was well However the Ultraboost is more comfortable for longer run duration

These shoes are sooo comfortable more than any other shoe I have worn

My son really likes the minds this is his second pair The style was a little narrower on him but still really loves the sneakers

Just like all UBthese are super comfy and ultra stylish I do not like the white soles these were a gift however they are a good looking shoe nonetheless

I like it because they look great and are really comfortable

Most comfortable shoe for pregame and to wear casually I do not recommend running in it though

I am a huge boost fan and love the Clima Cool style and color combination of these

My running shoe of choice from here on

This is my favorite running shoe Highly Recommend

I got my dad the black pair as a birthday gift and for Christmas he asked for the grey pair He loves them and wears them all the time He says they are some of the most comfortable shoes he has owned

ultraboost is still the most comfortable shoe and it looks great

Feels like your walking on air but a little slim on width

Another great adidas product I will be back for more

I love these shoes I bought like ten pair I can not stop

After doing research on the Ultra Boost I decided to go true to size and I am glad I did Once I got it in the mail I just could not wait to try it on The style the way it looks the way it feels is just perfect Well made top quality and hands down the most comfortable pair of sneakers I own Thank you Adidas

Exactly what I wanted The shoes are very comfortable and look great

Probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned like walking on clouds

These shoes are ridiculously comfortable I work on my feet so I need comfortable shoes that are bouncy and provide that much needed rest for my feet Like walking on pillows Not to mention how stylish they are and how many compliments I get

Another great ultraboost Love the color subtle but not boring

Super comfortable and performance is top notch A must buy

Shoes are very comfortable and are very light Shoes are also a little narrow

have not run in these shoes yet but so far feel great for walking I was told to get a 1 2 size bigger and recommend that my toe is just about at the edge Overall great shoes I will most likely get another pair

ultra boost is great but to tight please send instructions to get larger size

I enjoyed them so much I went out and bought my wife a pair for Christmas

These are the most comfortable sneakers ever I would recommend them to anyone I have flat feet with pain and these help a lot

I had a small scuff on the back heel Took a cloth and water the scuff came off easy but so did the silver paint of the adidas boost logo Obviously discounted boosts are made poor quality do not buy

My first ultraboost and I really like it Very comfortable My feet does not hurt after hours of walking

I love this product and personally own 5 pairs throughout a span of 4 years As a running shoe i could not ask for anything more and they are stylish enough for everyday casual wear The only problem I have noticed is the boost material tends to wear easier than the rest of the shoe nothing too drastic but to be noted

as any Adidas Product it is good quality and comfortable

I like how they look and feel Very stylish but can be worn all the time I would recommend sizing up though

Superior comfort and stylish So glad that I bought these shoes

This is my 4th ultraboost and as expected I am very satisfied Comfort looks and performance The bests of all the running shoes I ever had

The first time I noticed really noticed that the ultra boost are amazing is when I took my first run in them can not even feel the ground hahahah

This was a Christmas gift for my older son he loved it shoes are very comfortable and also look great I will definitely buy another pair for my younger son I am more of a NMD type but I also liked this shoes

I love the subtle rainbow accents and the mint base color They are comfortable

the product so comfortable I like Adidas product

The new ultra boost runners are high quality The support provided seems improved over earlier editions Very comfortable on the street or in the gym Good looking shoes

I had to order a 1 2 size larger than normal 11 because my normal size was rubbing my small toe and was uncomfortable The shoes look great and there are no apparent manufacturing defects They feel super comfortable too

Very good fit and very comfortable when it comes to a good fitting sneaker

Love the sneaker May just be one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever purchased

Returned due to red showing through mesh near left shoe toe box and shoes were too small

Favorite shoes ever they are my first pair of adidas and i love them Only problem is the cages scratch easy

Ultraboosts are very stylish yet so comfortable breathable and light for your feet

Stylish made well good color selection fit good comfortable

Parleys have a different feel than regular boost regardless get 1 2 size up if you have wide feet Great color

the product is great and the comfort is on point as always adidas do great and brand is always doing good

The ultraboost has become my everyday shoe from the first time I have first put them on Nothing compares in terms of both comfort and looks

The best when I can get my size 12 5 Great style comfort and performance

If you purchase a size up because they fit too narrow the next size up will be too big

Softest most comfortable shoe ever made well next 2 the nmd

Excellent shoes Highly recommend I have a pair in black and in white

There are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn hands down Also great quality Worth the purchase

Get at the very least a half size up These shoes are extremely comfortable but they are also very snug Great pair of everyday shoes

Extremely comfortable shoe and fits to perfection

I have had these shoes stolen twice and keep coming back to buy them since they are so good

The sole and the boost is very comfortable Can be worn in many occasions

Got these as a Christmas gift from my brother and they are amazing They do feel noticeably different than the shoes that I usually wear but they are definitely comfortable and pair nicely with many of my outfits I am very happy to have received this as a gift

Comfortable durable and looks great 10 10 would buy again

Have had 4 of these shoes and all were different in regards to size I had to return 2 of the 4 because they were too tight Tried ordering my true size 9 5 and 5 up in a 10 Ended up keeping the 10s but definitely does not feel like a 10 size I expcected more on quality control given the price but was wrong

Got these for my son for Christmas he loves them I would definitely recommend

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I highly recommend this shoe

Great everyday shoes very comfortable to walk around in

This is my sonsecond pair of ultraboosts and he absolutely loves them Super comfortable great style Keep up the great work

Made super well and hold up The quality is there for the price you pay

Love the contrasting heel cup and cage and the Parley c and aign promises

The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I would definitely recommend them

Most comfy shoe ever hard to wear other shoes now that my feet are spoiled Not only are they comfortable but are stylish too A shoe you can wear for running or just lifestyle Recommend to go half size up as they run small

Feels like your walking on air Great comfort would reccomend

Feel great now and love the style would recommend to others

The prime knit and boost make this my favorite shoe

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn only bested by the Yeezy V2 Will feel a bit tight out of the box but primeknit loosens to fit your feet perfectly True to size

Comfortable sneakers which can be worn to the gym or paired with jeans khakis Fit true to size feet feel they are wrapped in pillows

super comfortable and looks amazing great shoe all around

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes ever made

A little snug but overall great shoe I recommend half size bigger

Ultraboost is if not one of the most comfortable sneakers I ever wore

The shoes offer a variety of great elements The back heel tab is an eye catcher and it does not fall short of turning heads in any room

Received thee sneakers as a gift They are very comfortable and lightweight Great for running

Hands down the most comfortable shoe I have worn to date They have that original pinholes knit pattern of the ultra boost 1s around the toe and better breathing holes knitted into the top Great shoe my first pair of many

Very good product well made would recommend purchase

I like boost cushioning Please make a more solid insole that does not fold and come out when taking the shoes off

I bought this shoes for a son He has not taken them off since he got them

Got these for my dad who is on his feet all day They are very comfortable and soft His only complaint was that they were a little narrow

It is insanely stylish and comfortable while also perfectly fitting your foot

I really love the look of the product but I put comfort before everything and I am not that appreciative of them for that

UBs are the most comfortable sneakers on the market and contrary to what you might think about the sock part of the sneaker the give you better support and keep your feet warm in cold weather

Very comfortable shoe to wear on as a daily Highly recommend any ultra boost

Please make these shoes in wide and extra wide sizes

Fit is perfect though with the ultra boost I have to go a half size bigger than in the nmd 

Adidas signature running shoe is certainly top of the line and absolutely worth it is value UltraBoost is maximum comfort and offers support and stability even for those who are not frequent runners Triple white easily makes it my favorite colorway

I bought these as a gift I am told they are super comfortable and fit perfect

These shoes are very comfortable and they fit perfect

These shoes are versatile and go with many things

You can not go wrong with the ultraboost I did find this type to be slightly tight around the ankle area It could be due to the finish on the upper But compared to the other ultraboost I have had sizing wise this was color way was different

My family and I are very environmental but i just didnt like the way it looked on me though but great shoe and i love Adidas

This is my fourth UltraBoost purchased and I have to say that it definitely the best so far The colors in this shoe are great and the shoe itself feels amazing

Most comfortable shoe ever I would definitely recommend I purchased them for Christmas and I have not stopped wearing them

Theses are the most comfortable shoes and the fit is perfect

Waited way to long to buy my first pair of Ultra Boost They have exceeeded my expectations No doubt it will become a favorite shoe in my rotation

The ultra boosts are simple and nice looking true to size and most importantly comfy

The comfort level of the shoe is off the charts The gold and black colorway works well with black tracksuit

Nice to be able to help reduce plastics in the ocean The shoe comes up a little tight so had to send it back and then my was sold out so missed out but in the time I had them the shoe was very comfortable

As long as you get a half size up you are gonna be the happiest person in the world

Sized up 1 2 from my normal size and they fit pretty well just slightly long in the toebox My normal size felt a little tight Overall a great shoe

Most comfortable shoe on the market Worth every penny

Good product for the price Great style very comfortable

For size they fit perfectly completely flexible for the foot Great material used for looks Came out better than I expected

Great shoes and you cannot go with the Adidas BoostVery comfortable and all around great quality

very comfortable stylish beautiful would wear this everyday

I like them because they are so comfortable and fit perfectly

I like the parley from trash to fad very comfortable

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned This is my 3rd pair of UB Will be getting another pair

Most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned I have since bought 10 more pair

Most comfortable running shoe on the market I have ever purchased in all my life Highly recommend to whoever have doubt in ordering Fits true to size

looks cool and comfortable definitely made waves in the game

They are really comfy and stylish I also loved the way they fit

These are great running and casual shoes could wear them all day

Comfortable shoes and look good in person as well

This shoe is extremely comfortable and lightweight The only downside is that even with scotchguarding and daily cleaning it is impossible to keep this shoe clean due to the fabric upper not being made stain or dirt resistant by the manufacturer

I found these granite ultra boost mids to be a great addition to my collection They fit true to size and have a great balance of white grey and blue to bring out a very wintery vibe What you can not tell from the pictures is how vibrant the heel cup is it is truly pearlescent Additionally the primeknit has some nice sparkles glitter throughout that really elevate the aesthetic of the upper and capture the sense you are looking at a piece of granite The rope laces add a very nice premium touch to these mids

Almost everything is perfect except size is a little large and because they are a good looking shoe and white I do not want to get them dirty White was only avilible

Very comfortable light weight and is causal enough to wear with anything

It was a good show highly recommend If bought they are are good for running and simple style

it was so clean looking but wearing it outdoor acrually make me forget about lool because i was enjoying walking on the cloud

This is my 2nd pair of UBs and these shoes will forever be my go to shoes for my active lifestyle and even fashion as well

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Comfortable durable and stylish

it is comfortable and easy to wear for everyday the quality is good and it fits well on my feet

Would recommend this shoe just off the comfort and the design is very nice

Very comfortable shoesHighly recommendedWill definitely get other colorway

my third purchase of an adidas UltrA bOOst super comfy and responsive highly recommended

The shoes are really great they are great for running as well as everyday wear

I love it very nice and comfortable looks great quality

these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Start to break in front after just having for a few weeks No sure if material had a defect

i love the product i wear them with jeans casual pants or to play golf they are comfortable and great looking and when i wear his pair out i am buying another pair

The fit was on point I also work in my boost

The Ultra Boot is worth the money expensive but so comfortable that I have not worn another shoe since I received them 2 weeks ago It is like walking on a cloud so soft

These shoes have changed the way I look at shoes before I purchase them

shoes do fit snug as other reviews say but it is a very comfortable snug Love the blue dye and love getting to talk about Adidas environmental efforts when I wear them

The Multicolor knit on the 2 0s is incredible One of the best Multicolor Ultra Boost you can find if not THE very best Let alone one of the best 2 0s that has ever released Ordered my true to size pair without thinking you might want to go half a size up It was a bit tight at first however after a few wears the knit loosened up I took out my insoles just for that reason Some 2 0s you can get away with while some you will not be able to

Its size is bigger than other but it is really comfortable

Quality even after several washes the treads are worn but the shoe is still in pretty good shape

I will buy this shoe until they stop making them They fit perfectly feel amazing for running and walking and are stylish enough to wear for many occasions

I like all boost shoes I also like this color way The boost shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I would highly recommend anybody to try on a pair of boost

I love this product because there are so many ways to wear it They also provide great comfort and support and they do not wear out quickly They sometimes hurt the arch of my foot but that may be due to me tying them too tightly Overall a great shoe

Great color way for this shoe Ultra Boost is the bear shoe ever made

It looks and feels so good I am thinking of getting another Ultraboost for training and not to ruin this one

I love the color and the shoes are very comfortable

Very comfortable especially for life style wear although lacks lateral support which is frustrating for working out

I love these Ultraboosts Extremely comfortable like walking on clouds even at the end of a long day Amazingly awesome detailed design

excellent are release most comfortable Adidas shoes ever with the best heel cup on a Ultra Boost

The Boost is great comfortable works well with low cut joggers

Fits just right boost is comfortable looks great with cuffed joggers

Nothing much to say but boost is life I have heard to go half size down but I went true to size and it fits like a glove

I give it a 4 out of 5

The look of these are nice without looking gaudy Ok

Very comfortable very breathable shoes fit great Work well in the gym

I have multiple pairs of ultra boost Will definitely buy more

I missed these silvermedal the first time around and truly love this shoe Ultimate comfort and style

The heal came apart the first time worn Terrible quality

what is better than an UltraboostOne with two major updatesthe use of Parley which is environmentally sustainable and the added breathable the ventilation holes in the knit provide Plus these look great Always get compliments wearing these beauties and getting to raise awareness about Parley and their collaboration with adidas is a major plus

Boost are simply the most comfortable shoe ou there

These Ultraboosts are the most comfortable shoes I own

I love the colors and the details on this shoe The chrome and gold ultraboost logo is a cool touch

great product looks great feels great online slight downside is it was a little less stable than I was expecting Great for me for walking around but would not be supportive enough for running

Very comfortable shoes that have a slightly tight fit at first but after a couple of wears the shoe should stretch out and fit snug like a sock

I have three pairs of ultraboosts and they never fail to impress me

Very comfortable and soft Excellent aesthetic and very mobile

These are my favorite shoes They are the sharpest fashion statement for sports shoes I get great compliments

They sent me used shoes with the tags ripped off stains on the shoes and no paper in the shoes the way brand new shoes usually come

I rarely buy shoes besides black or white but this one is exception

These are the best looking and best feeling shoes

The color but the sizeing runs small but overall the rest is all good

Of the medal pack this is the one that stands out the least it is a little understated making it great for casual wear

I think for comfort there is not another shoe that can compete with this one

I feel like I am walking on a cloud This is all I wear anymore I am wearing them with my tuxedo for New Years

I have been dealing with Planters Faciitis for over 10 years After switching to boost shoes I am healed

I have worn these almost every day since I got them because they are so comfortable they are slightly tight when you first get them but loosen up super quick Honestly could not ask for much more

5 star chick and my main squeeze now cant get enough of them

Really comfortable and great styling free runner no problem on dressing up or down with these shoes boost midsole is awesome by itself already but with the primeknit made these by far the best you can get with a boost model fitment is true to size and I have a wide feet Highly recommended

I like it but I wouldnt have bought it if it was not for the Black Friday deal

Good and comfy but too narrow Ordered a size up

They feel a little loose and I think that is because the width is a little wide

It creates so many new outfits and I needed white shoes

The sizing is smaller comparing to 3 0

Most comforotable shoe period This is my 10th pair

LOVE Adidas this shoe is a little snug but wearable but cool as can be

One most comfortable shoe for day to day an working out

It may look like your average Ultraboost but step into these colorways and you all soon realize what you have been missing out on The subtle bronze touch from the heelcup to the bronze tip Laces and logo provide this Ultraboost a unique colorway approach Since it is first release I actually had trouble finding this color as it was not available in my local adidas stores Thankfully I am happy to announce to have them and for a sweet deal too Thank you Adidas

Very comfortable but not as soft as the climas Do get 1 2 size up They run small

Best walking shoe for me hands down I love the material craftsmanship

Honestly the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I love the style and comfort you get out of this shoe took them to Disney land for a whole day of walking and at the end of the day my feet felt perfectly fine

For the longest while I have been waiting to get these shoes I expected them to be pretty comfortable but these are more than just pretty comfortable it is like walking on sponge like pillows in your socks I will say that when I am sitting around it can get a little toasty but besides that there is not much downside at all Definitely a casual shoe you are crazy if you are thinking about running in these

The color way is amazing and they are the most comfortable shoes ever

Ultraboost is my favorite shoes since adidas release this Its good for running and casual used All the best

This shoe provides comfort for me through the day

Good looking and comfortable Favorite shoe I have gotten in a while

These are really nice looking shoes that you can dress up or down They are also super comfortable to wear Not sure yet about how they are in long distance running but they are at least a good casual shoe

These are just as great as the regular ultraboost but with a special cause Fit and style is excellent

I like the design of the shoes as well as the comfortablility

do not fit right I would like to return them My right foot rubs against my left foot

I have been waiting for a pair of multi colored UltraBoost 4 0 all year and was very excited when I saw these pop up however I was very disappointed when I saw them in person because the colors are so dull that the shoes look black and white on feet I returned them and will continue to wait for a decent multi color 4 0

The pair I recieved the heel cup extended over the collar

I have been a fan of ultra boost This new black color way looks interesting and nice Good quality and very comfortable I would like to see more Parley version of ultra boost

Great colorway that stands out in a good way Really glad they released again

Honestly has great support so my feet are not sore while at work However even with slim feet like mine it is snug after a week of breaking them in it be way to slim for people with wider feet I normally wear 8 5 in other brands to give myself a little bit of toe room for comfortability but this one runs a little smaller and my toe reaches the very end Overall great comfort but a little fine tuning on the sizing should be considered

This is hands down the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn You will not regret your purchase

The shoes have the high level of comfort and quality

That shoes are great and all but just a little tight

Comfy and light have not worn any other shoe since

I bought these for my dad and they are now his daily beaters You can not go wrong with Boost

Perfect shoes for any type of activities traveling to PE

Comfortable and fire I got good deal on black Friday

These shoes really strike a balance between comfort and support The knit looks great and they are comfortable These are not a hardcore trail running shoes by any means but I use these for the gym and very short easy runs The only issue that may pop up for some is the placing of the rubberized parts on the arch side and up towards the ball of the foot This is always tricky with these types of shoes but these work for me

My grandson loves these shoesthese are his second pair

In 2016 when I was still new to Ultraboosts I saw the medal pack too late to get my hands on a pair I was very excited to see Adidas bring them back for the holidays and I was not disappointed when I received them in the mail The most notable thing of course is the glossy silver heel cap which looks even more amazing in person You can not really understand it until you do because it provides a reflective feel that hard to do justice in photos The other surprise is how good the silver thread looks Embedded in the upper it glints well in the light at unexpected angles Overall one of my favorite Boost purchases to date

I bought them yesterday and they are wonderful they are very comfortable light fresh recommended for all runners I am going to buy more styles

I normally would never pay this much for any other issue but I can admit these are worth the money Insanely comfortable

Shoes are very comfortable but remember to purchase one size larger than usual

comfortable and stylish very good for walking and running

They are extremely comfortable it is like walking on a cloud

Extremely comfortable shoes Appear to be quite durable I am 65 270 lbs and I love them

The Ultraboost is a comfortable shoe in general plus this specific shoe I really liked the color way

You really can not beat the Ultraboost for casual comfort and everyday wear Stylish and good looking shoe True to size for me

With the great comfort that you have come to expect from the Ultraboost midsole the eye catching colorway makes this one of my go to sneakers

Giving these as a gift so while I do not know what he will think of them I know that I am very jealous and want a pair for myself now

Overall these are my favourite shoes I wear them all the time They are super comfortable and they fit perfectly I will be getting another pair soon

okay it is a good shoe and it is comfortable

great style and comfort I get complements on my shoes from other people

very comfortable I like the look of the shoes

Love the color wave Size as expected one of my faves

Most comfortable shoes ever Feels like walking on clouds

First time buying an adidas shoe ever and I used the adidas fit guide Awesome awesome shoe and would buy another pair Recommend for an weekend getter all around comfort shoe

If you are looking to by this shoe I would get a half size up from normal Other than that this shoe is extremely comfortable

Its a great pair of shoes They are comfortable and light Feels like walking on clouds I like the look of them Wore them now for about two weeks and no sore feet or discomfort Im a size 9 and they recommend ordering a half size up which I did They fit great though I think you can be just as okay with a 9 Reason for 4 stars is that at times when take off shoes the pad inside shoes comes off easily which is inconvenient but nothing major Overall would buy again Great pair of workout shoes

Great shoe A little tight at first Great colorway

Anything to help the oceans Consider buying half a size up as they come in a little tight

The shoes look great and feel great its just annoying how everytime I take them off the insoles come out with my footon both pairs I own If the insoles were secured or at least designed to stay in theyd really be the perfect shoes

The ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe I have ever tryed on They are very breathable and have lots of grip and stability They are super easy to slip on and off ConsI take extsermely good care of my shoes I have noticed that the heel cups and cage could get scuffed or scratched very easily and same for the boost mid sole Not on my pair but others the contenential rubber on the outsole wears down and bottoms out but I pretucularly does not have this problem Another thing is that there is lots of glue marks and stains on the shoe All along the bottoms of the fly kit upper or where the top of the boost midsole meets the upper There are also glue marks on the connection of the plastic cage and the heel cup where the midsole connects On pair when I got them there was glue marks across the heel cup but I easily just scratched it off with my finger The boost midsole is really durable as for the same as the fly kit upper and overall the whole shoe Be carful when wearing with jeans and contact with water One of the colorways I purchased was the triple white and some of the dye from the jeans dripped onto the tounge with slite tint of blue but not notice able Over all great shoe and really recommend

Very comfortable and sleek shoes I have received severa compliments about the look of them already

The squishy soles are amazing fit is perfect Great shoe for working out or hanging out

The shoes are very comfortable and stylish They are excellent to run and workout in Only problem with them is the sides of the white soles stained green when I ran through grass I cannot get them clean

This shoes are amazingly comfortable I would totally recomend this shoes for people that suffer from knee pain This shoe is literally like walking on clouds

Very very comfortable shoe Very light and breathable

Comfortable Stylish etc

Nothing compares to the comfort these shoes provide

I LOVE my ultraboosts I have 2 pairs so far I have the core blacks and the tripple whites The tripple whites are more of my running shoes but I do wear them out and to school every once in a while But my core blacks are my every day shoes I have had my core blacks for about 4 5 months of almost every day usage and there is a little spot where the knit has pulled but I have learned to deal with it and am going to be getting a pair of either the red ones or the new tripple blacks that come out on December 3rd But even with the knit pull they are still my favorite pair of shoes I have ever worn And Adidas thanks for the great shoe and motivation to lose 60 pounds I was 180 at the age of 13 and now I am 120 at the age of 14 You guys motivated me Thank you adidas

The fit is smaller I had to size up from what I usually get I personally LOVED the 3 0 with continental rubber I just recently threw them out after having them for years and bought these for a replacement and I am disappointed Bring those back please

My friends Pam and Jeff extolled the comfort of these shoes and I just dismissed their recommendations as hype When another shoe company used a quarterback for one of their ads they lost my business I came to Adidas looking for a super comfortable shoe and that is what I got with the Ultraboost Truly a great shoe

I like this shoe mainly because of how extremely comfortable it is I work long days on my feet and at the end of them wearing these shoes I axperiance no foot pain It also is environmentally friendly with the collaboration with Parley

I love this model and ultraboost is the best The all black is dope

Purchased for a girl friend of mine and she is a size 8 and purchased size 9 am for her and it fits perfectly

I liked the color of this shoe but the way it fit on me felt weird It felt a tad small but also a tad unlike the other shoes when it comes to comfort

Love the comfort Nice colorway but do definitely get a half size up your current size because they run small

Way too comfortable I wear this literally everywhere

Extremely Comfortable and runs perfectly Matches every outfit

STYLE COMFORT LITTLE BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH IT WILL BUY AGAIN

it is literally the most comfortable pair of tennis shoes I own

Comfortable and stylish with a great colorway that really goes well together

The hype is real There is no shoe more comfortable than the Adidas ultraboost I was so impressed with how comfortable they were I had to go back and buy 3 other pairs to gift friends and family just so they could understand HOW GOOOD THEY ARE

After listening to friends talk about how good the ultraboost technology was I had to give it a try MIND BLOWING the primeknit is flexible and premium with just the right amount of breathability The ultraboost sole is just out of this world Every step you take is like walking into a cloud

Good shoe like them a lot thank you good bounce in the walking

Good quality shoe but want more cushion under the sole

Had to return got wrong color thought shoe was Collegiate blue

Comfort design and fit I will be back for another pair

I have been running for over 10 years and collecting sneakers for 2 years now and I can say with confidence these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever used I am fortunate to own 2 pairs of NMDs and some Yeezy 350s all of which use Boost technology and these are the best of the bunch Definitely planning on buying more in the future and have already converted most of my family to loving these shoes

I love the ultraboost because they are the most comfortable shoe ever

Very clean ultraboost Colorway goes with anything

One of the best color ways to date Perfect true to size fit

nice fit fits well great running shoe price ok 1

ultra boost are really the most comfortable shoe around

The shoes are sooo comfy and fit my feet nicely too

I usually wear a size 11 in most shoes but I had to size down to a 10 5 in these the comfort level is incredible and I wore this shoe all day everyday with no complaints

A very and highly recommended shoe for people looking for cushioned wth great price

I have been looking for the most comfortable shoes for so long and I have found it it is the ultra boost

Style and comfort Price could be cheaper on the other hand since they are for a growing boy who grows out of them fast

The shoes are extremely comfortable they fit great primeknit upper hugs your feet really well and keeps them in place

Quality materials Very comfortable Perfect sizing Very light Great for running Great energy rebound from heel to toe

I like the discount provided and the fast delivery I would highly recommend these shoes due to the comfort

Bought for my son The shoes fit well but are a little more narrow than other options My son says they are the most comfortable running shoe he has tried but the price is steep which is why I can only give these 4 stars instead of 5

One of the best shoes that adidas has released You can not go wrong with this shoe

Great fit and quality These shoes are the most comfortable I have owned

I have been wearing them for less than a month and they just suddenly started to squeak like a rusty door Unbelievable that I paid this much and I do not even want to wear them anymore

I already had the same product but in black You can not go wrong with the style or the fit

Super comfortable and fits perfectly Adidas did a great job designing them

Extreme comfort great look and phenomenal style This is a MUST COP for anyone who loves shoes

Very comfortable material and soles Very light and smooth to run in

it is good and it do not suck so buy it unless you a bum

I love the look and feel of these shoes on my feet they are very comfortably although I did have to go half a size up because I have wide feet Overall it is a really versatile shoe that you can wear with pretty much anything

My favorite shoes from adidas so far Very comfortable and goes with everything

These Ultraboost are very comfortable great for runners and walkers alike they are also great for those who are on their feet a lot and want their feet to be comfortable They look great with jeans or khakis I have recommended these to many who do not usually wear sneakers because they find sneakers uncomfortable but they have all purchased a pair of Ultraboost and love them I highly recommend these I wish that all Ultraboost came with reflective laces and reflective stripes It would help during early morning or late evening runs and or walks I have added my own flair and purchase reflective laces for all of my Ultraboost purchases

Fits my foot comfort and support plus great look

a litter tight but still very comfortable Color is also cool

It feels like you walking on clouds Because of my work that requires me to be on my feet most of the day the flexibility of the primknit and softness of the boost helps out

I wear these everyday They go with most everything and they look amazing These are easily the most well received non flashy shoes I own People of all ages comment about them and the UB 4 is so soft and comfy Get yourrself a pair before you can not anymore

They run a little tight so I can not wear thick socks but other than that I like them a lot just wish I would have gone up a half size

Nice looking and feels good I wish they were less expensive

Looks good and feels great Would be nice if they were less expensive

This is the most comfortable shoe I own I love it

These shoes are great for gym to out The color is neutral but different for someone who always wears black or grey Super comfortable but stable

I love the style and fit best runner ever with great cushion

I really liked the shoe Extremely comfortable However the caging sratches and leaves marks very easily That would be my only complaint Otherwise its an all around great shoe

Super comfortable and look great There is a small defect on one of the uppers that is barely noticed I am so happy with the shoes I already ordered a custom pair

The sole is good to carry your weight and then the sides are little bit narrower Please select a higher size if you want to buy this otherwise it can be narrow

Comfortable and fits precisely Great shoe overall

The most comfortable pair of shoes that I have ever owned

This shoe is amazing I got it at one of their stores and I never regretted the decision It fits so well around the ankle Definitely recommend it

did not like color but was comfortable but my other UB all terrain way better

It fits perfectly around my feet and is very comfortable plus it goes great with casual fits

Ultraboost is my favorite adidas I am a BIG fan of Parley and have bought almost all SKU of Parley Ultraboost This color combo is wonderful and very cool for the summer

Feels comfortable while walking running doing anything that requires your feet really

Awesome colab with Parley again Love the color way and breathable PK The perfect UB to wear when going to the beach

very good shoes it was a very good purchase and i would buy another pair

Bought this awhile back and just getting around to give my review Have a lot of boost pairs UB NMD R1 NMD R2 PUREBOOST 350 V2 NMD CS2 and not getting tired of getting more pairs What can I say BOOST is LIFE and it is very comfortable

ive had the navy colored supernovas and they were super comfortable over all I think ultraboosts are my favorite and the best running shoe on the market THANKS ADIDAS

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

These seem to be great for a lot of people I tried them on when they first arrived and found them tighter than I would expected Wore them out for the day By the time I got home I was experiencing a good amount of tension in my foot and ankle Some reviews say the shoe has a break in period but I think mine were just too small Returned

I like it not everything I expected but still ok I will where then

Because their Awesome Have 4 different pairs Softest shoes on your feet you can buy

I liked the product The first shoe I had to return because was defective This one seems good

These are amazing Comfortable and light Totally recommend it

Its is simply the best styled and most comfortable shoe ever

The boost aspect makes the wearer feel like your walking on clouds Better then any other shoe I have worn prior for long walks

A good pair of trainers A little tight but will just wear thin socks

I bought this shoe a little while ago and my pair is just perfect it fits perfectly and looks amazing I hope the cushion from the boost lasts as long as my last pair of NMDwhich I bought two years ago and still wear regularly

Its super comfortable and unique Also it matches my outfits

Super comfortable But the white soles get dirty Quickly and hard to clean

Ultraboost are always so comfy and light weight

The UltraBoost provide a comfort that can not be matched

These shoes are extremely comfortable I use them whenever I know I am going to be walking around a lot The neutral colors make it easy to match with a lot of clothes especially whites and darker colors Worth every penny

it is comfortable and only gets more comfortable with every step

The shoes has been a classic for the longest time and it is getting more innovative as time goes on

I bought these as my fourth pair of Ultraboosts The color was what sold me It does have a bit of maroon in the knit but they look really good with khakis

Just got these and they fit like a glove they are true to size and feel great I highly recommend the adidas ultra boost you will not be disappointed it is like walking on pillows

The shoe is so comfy and it has a awesome style

I am in love with my tennis been wearing them the whole week

A bit tight on the width but other than that it is a great shoe

Great shoe that fits true to size Not a narrow shoe aside from running its a great casual shoe

The boost technology makes ultra boosts one of the most comfortable shoes out there Definitely can be on your feet all day in them Had to buy a pair for everyone in my family

so comfortable and I was so happy when I finally got to show them off

These have great style look amazing and feel great on your foot

It has a snug fit that the Uncaged versions do not have Best pair of shoes I have ever owned

I bought this shoe for my freshman year of high school and now I am a junior and they still look like they are only a month old They are super comfortable and can slide on and still stay tight on you feet Best shoe you can get hands down

The Ultra Boost are literally the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They are also very durable fit perfectly and are easy to wear with pretty much any outfit Definitely recommend

Very good looking and comfortable shoes for everyday wearing and gym training

Super comfortable feels like I am walking on a cloud the quality construction does not exactly match up with the price point though

I am on my feet all day these shoes are very comfortable They also have lots of styles will definitely be purchasing more shoes

I always love to buy Parley shoes This ultraboost color looks great so I buy 2 pairs it is a ultraboost so everything else continues to be great

Love the ultraboost line and love their colors Overall a premium shoe for the price

I am honestly not sure these are better than my pureboosts I bought which were cheaper

Great shoes Little pricey but I am still happy with them

Ultraboost are the most comfortable shoe that I can dress up or go running in

Looks good feels good what else can I sayI want more

I went half a size up like recommended fit was fine a little narrow Was a little disappointed with the shoes out of the box though the cage came stained with some gold colored marks that reflected a obnoxious amount of light and the plastic heel counter looked poorly attached to the midsole The cushion was impressive as expected I would still recommend this product because of how comfy and stylish the sneakers are but it will not like blow your mind or anything

Stylein my opinion I love the parley versions of any adidas product I have been really trying to make an effort to buy and recycle products Next cop is the AM4LA just because it is a parley addition

This shoes fit very well and look great The midsole cushions wonderfully I will be buying more of these

Not only is it a great shoe to log quality miles in but it has amazing street style I have a couple colors of the Ultraboost to devote some to running and some for everyday wear

The most confortable shoe I have ever owned in my entire life

Easily the most comfortable shoe I have ever bought

I have bought a few different shoes walking in the city and walking at Disney World These are without a doubt the best option over both my nike my salomen hiking shoes and vans ultrarange You can feel the bounce in each step it almost feels like memory foam it is incredible

despite uncomfortable with insole these shoes are good quality and light weight

The Ultraboost is one of the shoes that got adidas huge I really love the color and comfort that it gives Great casual shoe and sport shoe

I like this product because of it is amazing comfort

Very comfortable and fits true to size would recommend

Great colors great feel and great support These have it all but they are really tight so be prepared

The 3M fabric is an awesome touch I would purchase again

This is the most comfortable running shoe You walk on air on these shoes

If exposed to water the shoes can possibly cause an allergic reaction to the gule used to make the shoe

Overall decent running shoe with decent overall quality

This shoe is extremely comfortable and fits great This shoe is great for both sport use and casual wear

For its price the quality and comfort is amazing Sizing and width fit perfectly for me The boost made my feet feel like they were in sort of a box filled with cotton balls

This is a great product I like the fit and colors the most

The problem is ankle too narrow when I take a sock that feeling so bad

Great quality and color is more appealing and neutral in person

They are a very comfortable shoe They fit well and the ultraboost is always great Not sure how they will hold up long term or when i go to clean them though

the cage gets scratched way to easy the crevises of the bost gets dirt in them and does not come out

fast shipping super comfy and over all great quality

This purchase was money well spent GO UP HALF A SIZE

The shoes are getting really comfortable and I just wanna wear it for a whole day it is a perfect purchase for walking or running I will probably purchase again By the way I really like it is color

These sneakers are stylish and the color is very nice

Very comfortable and I really enjoy the texture and feel of the shoe when running

very comfortable the price very good the pretty colors the fashionable style

I think I need another pair to give a better review

I love the shoes Super comfy and they look sweet as well The only problem I have is that the knit texture on the shoes seems pretty fragile Besides that they are great Would still totally recommend purchasing them Best pair of shoes I have ever owned

The shoes are really comfortable It looks great with joggers or jeans

This product is very comfortable and fits my day to day need

This is a good shoe However it is a pain to get my feet in there the attached tongue makes it incredibly hard to wear it Also due to the same reason the insole comes out everytime I take off the shoe The place is very thin and keeps getting untied so have to stop and tie it again Extremely comfortable but these points need to be addressed

One of my favorite pair they are so comfy can be standing up for hours and my feet will not hurt I just wish they can sell more smaller sizes like a 4 would be great

adidas has the best running shoes on the market today and this particular model is at the forefront of their product line Comfortable yet sleek and stylish Not much more you can ask for

I wanted to really really like these shoes but they are just a little tight I picked my usual size but they are juuuuust a little snug Size up and I would be swimming in them do not get me wrong I like them but I just do not love them like some of my other Adidas joints

BOOST is like walking on clouds Love that they have a breast cancer awareness edition

Really comfortable shoes I use them for work for the weekends and working out An all in one that you can not go wrong with

Although they get dirty very easily they look great The boost is nice and is great for running

A runner for years and a huge Ultraboost fan A clean and neutral colorway to add to my sneakers running and streetwear rotation Keep up the great work adidas

Everything about it the look and the feel are just outstanding

A very comfortable item with amazing quality It looks very nice aswell

Very comfortable very nice looking high quality and very light shoes

I like how they fit and its true to size and its a light shoes Perfect for walking or standing for a long period of time

Comfortable and made well This is my second pair

Although they ran smaller than expected they are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever tried

This is my second pair of Ultraboost and i am just happy with the quality of these shoes

they are like putting your foot in a large container of warm mashed potatoes

The most comfortable sneaker I have purchased and looks great on feet Love it

They are very comforatble and for to the foot very well

I like the product because of how comfortable the shoe is and how versatile ultra boosts are

Never bought Adidas prior was never really a fan but i finally tried on a pair of Ultra Boost and changed how I feel on your products the amount of comfort I felt was incredible

Got my buddy his first pair of ultra boost and he loves them Went with all white so it could go with everything Highly recommend to anyone looking for a durable and comfortable running shoe

These shoes are so comfortable and are a must buy

Love the comfort and fit of these Ultra Boost 4 0s

coming from the 2 0 this updated version has a tighter knitted upper and a cleaner colorway the ankle collar feels more padded which is always a plus

No matter how many reviews you read telling you they are true to size ignore that They are half a size too small The End You will thank me once you remove them off your feet and your feet are not burning from excruciating pain due to a super snug tight fit

I love it because of its meaning and the fact that it spreads awarness

Product arrived in perfect condition and looked amazing While standing in this shoe all day this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Comfortable and lite weight I have narrow feet so the fit was perfect for me

Mu son loved them They fit perfectly and are very comfortable

As comfortable as you would expect from an UltraBoost and a beautiful colorway

Ultraboosts are the best shoe for anything you could think of I just bought my third pair because of how comfortable they are They are great for walking around and great for running very comfortable

really nice shoe comfortable and worth the money i spent on them 8 5 10

Only problem it was not the right size for me other than that it was perfect

I currently wear this shoes and another NMD you can significantly feel the difference This one fit wonderfully like it is designed for my feet The one I purchased looks kinda greyish from far but the color is actually very vivid looking closely Overall I consider this to be the best sneaker I bought in the last few years

I own a few pairs of these and they are the most comfortable shoes out there so if your looking for a high quality shoe this is the one you want

These shoes are great to run long distances in They are very lightweight and are very comfortable My favorite running shoe to date

This shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes ever

Ultrboosts are my preferred running shoes for years and I buy many pairs a year They were always one size bigger than my number and I remember seeing reviews recommending to buy one size down for a good fit for running This time though they seem to be at size so my shoes are now feeling a little tighter than it used to be Other than that they are my perfect running shoes after running for 37 years

I needed some good shoes but also comfortable since I walk A LOT these shoes are amazing and worth the money Make sure you order the correct size because these are differently than other shoes I normally wear a 9 5 or 10 BUT in these I am an 11 Definitely will be sticking with Adidas

These new ultraboost are extremely comfortable and stylish I can wear them with almost everything

This is my 1st pair of ultraboosts and I will definitely be buying more pairs they are super comfortable and they are some of the best looking shoes you can buy and the parley colorways are also for a good cause

I have said it before and I will say it again The Ultraboosts are super comfortable And these Hi Res blue silhouettes are just so nice looking I am in the process of slowly but surely replacing all of my old shoes with Ultraboosts

Good style Superior comfort Looking forward to new colorways and shoe designs

Essentially ticks off all the boxesthe only complaint is how easy it stainsbut that is inherent in white shoes

The upgraded version from the previous one really love the sole

This shoe is amazing Super comfy your walking on clouds definitely recommend and will be buying again

Get these shoes because they are worth every penny

really nice fit if you have narrow feet recommend to everyone with narrow feet

A great shoe for running or just wearing while you are out and about it is very comfy and not too flashy it is a unique and functional shoe

This product is incredibly comfortable I have worn huaraches roshes and a few jumpman shoes for years but these shoes will be the only shoes I purchase from here on out The boost cushion support is the first noticeable feature the moment after putting the shoe on and taking your very first step Buy these shoes Worth the money

Very impressed with this shoe Extremely comfortable and a perfect fit

The sneakers are comfortable soft on the heel provide great stability for runners

Comfort and style all in one Best version of the Ultraboost Take the prime knit of a NMD and puts in on a Ultraboost that is what you have here

it is comfortable fits like a sock goes with about anything I wear and positive impact on environment too

Great shoe and very comfortable when I am on the go

Not near enough cushioning Lots of foot and leg pain after use Innersole was of no value So thin to be totally of no value Way overpriced did not sense any torsion in the Torsion System Heel sort of okay but sole not even close Very disappointing

By far the most comfortable sneaker I have ever worn Fits and looks fantastic Well worth the price if you are able to find the shoe in stock

It is a very comfortable shoe and the fit is perfect

I bought the shoes for my grandson he has 17 they only worn to school for a couple of weeks The sole of the shoe has separated We have used super glue to try to make them wearable 180 00 was a lot

super comfortable and nice color Got lots of compliment

BEST ULTRA BOOST COLORWAY TO DATE SO GLAD THEY BROUGHT IT BACK

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I HIGHLY recommend them

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and great style

This specific shoe model is one to live for literally I would recommend this shoe to every single person It is really comfortable the colors are really well mixed and also it can last a long time

I have worn these shoes for hundreds of miles on dirt rocks grass and they are still in great condition Very loose where they should be but not in a way that would allow them to slip off best running shoes I have owned

This is my first pair of Parleys and I could not be happier I have a few pairs of Ultraboosts that are size 12 and I got these in 11 5 and they fit perfect Love the color of the shoes

Great shoe comfy Past experience is they do stretch out loose some shape after awhile

I am a repeat customer for this light sturdy shoe Only slight criticism from previous pairs is that after some use insoles come loose when you remove foot from shoe Everything else holds up excellently in daily use

it is soft and cushiony sole leaves my feel sleep too well Shape and size is perfect

The shoe comfort is really off the charts the boost is incredibly cushioning and the knit feels like a sock but not loose Adidas really has perfected this shoe the looks are incredible but not extravagant and the comfort is incredible I have worn these almost every day since I got them and find any excuse I get to put them on They also make so many outfits perfect as they are such a great overall shoe I can not think of any shoe that can work with both a flannel and also as a running exercise shoe it is worth your money trust me

Absolutely love the fit I do not normally like to purchase online but the Adidas Ultra Boost are a great shoe Best fit and support that I have experianced

Great for running and everyday life they look and feel great

THE perfect summer shoe Comfortable airy and good looking Plus it is got an eco friendly vibe

These shoes are the most comfortable things that I have worn They are even more comfortable than adidas yeezy boost 350 v2 They do run a bit small so I would recommend ordering a half size larger than usual They are very easy to pair with clothes and do not stick out The sole is very comfortable and the support in the shoes is great Overall I would recommend this to anyone and you should not pass on this opportunity

The more you wear the more comfortable it will be

I typically wear 9 but for some reason ultraboosts I go half a size up I have narrow feet Shoes are lovely

I love the ultra boost they fit great and are comfortable Only complaint is a tiny defect in the heal area The outsole was cut a little short of the boost midsole

Fit is slightly small so I had to go half size up Overall comfort and quality is great Love that I can just throw them in the washing machine to clean

I like the product because it hugs the side of my feet tightly and holds my foot in place making the shoe very comfortable over all

I love that the shoes are made from recycled ocean plastic and feel like wearing a pair of socks rather than shoes Very comfortable

Perfect sneakers very comfortable The most comfortable sneakers ever had

I was advised to get 0 5 size up I am usually 8 5 so I got size 9 The ankle area seems too tight On day 2 3 I am starting to feel my right big toe with discomfort My toenails are not even long yet The length is longer than my feet so there should be enough allowance But it is not helping Grip is mostly there but I am surprised I lose at some as if someone put a powder on the floor

The urltraboost is an amazing shoe The boost is giant so feel all of it when walking Good for any sport or activity you do

Love the shoes Just wish there was an easy way to get a different size without paying more money

It looks good and comfort levels are off the chart

Great shoe for casual wear and even work in the gym The shoe is great for shorter runs but would recommend looking into more supportive shoes if you are planning longer runs

these shoes are so nice and comfy the only down side is when it gets colder your feet get cold because it lets so much air in but there are running shoes not winter shoes but best shoes ever bought

The Parley program is doing fantastic things for our oceans and the comfort of this shoe is phenomenal

Best parley ultra boost 35th pair of ultra boost so far

Better than vapormaxes definitely would recommend to people that run a lot and heels hurt afterwards

Has a perfect amount of support on all sides as well as for the bottom of the foot Enough breathability for the foot to stay cool and comfortable

Awesome for everyday wear order size up for complete comfort

I got my true size 11 and it seemed to be too tight Then i got a 11 1 2 which fit better I have herd the Parley tend to fit differently from any other boosts

The Boost foam is greatest thing ever created I love it

I bought these shoes and I love them I also have NMD and they are great too

I like this pair a lot its simple and the color is consistent and smooth across the shoe Underrated color way for sure since it isnt as flashy as a lot of shoes out there but it is still a great looking pair of boost

In Short Good cause lackluster design

These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes in the world Not only are they comfortable they are super stylish These are great for pulling off street wear pieces

I cannot say enough about these shoes They has the Boost soles so nothing can beat them just because of that They are really breathable and light They are all white besides the Parley stitching throughout which make these look awesome My favorite all white shoes I have ever had and I am not usually fond of white shoes My dad even liked them

My arches hurt constantly but not with these shoes I definitely recommend them

The most comfortable shoes I ever wore The price is steep but well worth it I am looking into buying more colors

Perfect fit comfortable and sporty Great product

Super comfortable would purchase again great quality

It fits perfectly and materials used do not feel cheap

I have had several parley ultra boosts these climacool are fantastic Same comfort more breath ability Ultra boost still rules the roost

QUALITY IS AMAZING BOOST FOR LIFE SOOOOOOO COMFY

very comfortable the whole shoe fits very nice but in my opinion the laces are just for style because they do not do much but they fit perfectly

Great shoes to workout in and also very awesome to just casual wearing

it is super comfortable and they have good airflow They seem very snug and are good for runs and the gym

Very nice and subtle integration of the parley accents

They are very comfortable The color match is very nice

Got these shoes after seeing my friends wear them but I am different colors Saw these online and no one really had he color so I got them and I have loved them ever since Most comfortable shoes I have ever had Only thing I have noticed is that after a few days of wearing them they begin to look better on your feet as if they mold to you Awesome

I felt very sharp and clean while wearing this shoe

I love the comfort style and fit of the shoes they are great for everyday use

Very comfortable to work out in Little worried about how they will hold up since they are mostly white

Very comfortable shoe very stylish i would strongly recommend a 1 2 size up

This shoe is a standout never had such a comfortable shoe so far The primeknit adapts to your feet so well it feels like more of a sock than a shoe Also it is a clima which means it has amazing breathability Boost midsole best in the world And the fact that it is partly made from recycled bottles its a shoe for a good cause people should definitely buy these One thing to note is that the pictures on the website do not do justice to the appearance of the shoe it looks 10x better in person The pictures miss some detail about the unique colors of the threading Other than that 101 buy this as your next shoe

Other than the tighter mouth of the shoe unlike normal ultraboodts it is perfect

My feet require extra cushion and extra support Ultraboost delivers every bit of what i need Do yourself a favor and get a pair Make sure to get a half size bigger They run a little small

i bought the pair for my husband he loves it so much im buying pair for me too

I bought this shoe for my husband and he loves them Super cool color and style can not wait for youth ultraboost to come out so I can get a pair for my 10yearl old

the color is good nothing wrong except a little bit thin

Material is different then normal ultra boost not as soft Shoes if still comfortable

I like the product because it helps the environment

By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I love the style Hoping to see a Navy Blue Yellow white option as those colors seem to be the style right now

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have been walking in these shoes for a year

the fit and comfort are unmatched the combination of boost and prime knit makes it feel like your feet are not constricted No blisters or having to break in like with many other shoes when brand new

I love the shoes for their comfort and feel it is like walking on clouds in slippers

These shoes look so good in person the fabric is very high quality and the shoes just have that look the cage is sort of blended into the shoe but the layers really make this shoe stand out

I love Ultra Boost and I love Parley so when I saw this colorway was coming out I knew I was copping instantly These feel just like any other Ultra Boost but I love that the cage is fabric For my foot that type of cage is my favorite The sprinkling of the color is perfect in my opinion and makes this a great looking shoe

These shoes are awesome Super comfortable and look great whether you are running or going out

I really enjoy the look and comfort of the Parley shoes They breathe well and they look sharp The downside for me was that they are not optimal for actual training They are a tad bigger than expected but even if I tighten them up the insoles slip around some when doing weighted sprints

This shoe is perfect use it for my workouts while I jog as well as casually

Ultra Boosts are at the penicle of style comfort and performance I highly recommend these shoes

Everyone knows UltraBOOST is the best shoe but when adidas offered a Breast Cancer collaboration I was all in I got mine for the Susan Komen Race for the Cure in Houston and I will wear them with pride

it is my go to sneaker and loving all the 4 0 colorways Only wish they would retro some of the 1 0 colors

Very comfortable as with every ultraboost I owned Been a fan of the parley collaboration

Comfortable nice colors and got it on sale which it was a great steal

Love the shoe but the knit is kind of thight on my feet but overall is a very comfortable shoe

Best ultra boost ever and th comfort level is on another level

The Ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe on the market There I said it My feet had no idea what actual comfort was until I tried Boost technology for the first time It actually feels like you are walking on flipping clouds Especially for those people who work in retail or have jobs that require them to stand for hours at a time this is the go to shoe Immense comfort and it does not seem to tire you out even though you have been standing for 3 hours straight For running these shoes are also solid Stability in the midfoot area from the plastic three stripes and a solid locked down sensation from the heelcuptopped with the Primeknit upper Boost midsole and Continental tire this shoe is perfect to take on those city runs Adidas has set a new standard for running shoes and the other brands have some catching up to do

I like the message behind Parley and the shoes are incredibly comfortable 11 10 would purchase another pair

The shoes fits perfect and It feels amazing Worth the buy

Fit like a glove super comfortable shock absorbent bottom sole awesome grip

True to size fit and unique color scheme I recommend this shoe to others

The boost gets dirty way too quick I recommend making some sort of cleaning solution

Unbelievable shoe that is great for comfort and even better with STYLE They look Perfect with the right pair of Joggers3STRIPELIFE

 Tip of AdviceGo 1 2 a size higher than your normal size

Worst shoe ever the eyeletes rip out and the shoe twists causing ankle twists

They run a bit smaller than the previous generations of ultraboost but still the best shoes ever

I wear the same size in every other brand and style of shoe These we are too small Bummer

Really comfortable Maybe the best shoes for walking that I have ever had

I love this shoes they are very comfortable and quality

I admittedly have more pairs than I should now as once I found Boost I could not stop These are the most comfortable shoes I own and I now own multiple colorways

Loved it The boost is amazingly comfortable and the shoes lasts a while

Comfortable cushions and great looking shoes Good materials

These shoes run one size small After having to send back two times we finally got the right size My son loves them

These shoes are my go to They fit very snugly and the shoe feels like I am stepping on clouds thanks to the thick boost sole Outsole wears out quickly however

Such a nice shoe The look The feel The quality You can wear it all day everyday and it will almost always match something and it will stay comfortable for a very very long time This is my second pair and my first pair is almost just as comfortable and has over a year of wear That says alot for the boost Love it

Shoes ended up being very tight and narrow Tried wearing them to work on an 8 hr shift and my feet were screaming what is the point of the laces if they are not actually tying anything

These held up walking but then I started running in them and they completely fell apart The inside piece that protects the toes is falling off The boost is all brown and the part underneath the sole is also coming off Previous ultra boosts have been fine but this one is not The quality is not good at all compared to previous ultra boosts so beware

It is so comfortable to my feet and I like the fit

Ultraboost will not disappoint best shoes out there The comfort level and the technology in the boost has yet to disappoint buying more

My 5th Ultraboost and love this colorway from the Parley collab You can never go wrong with the Ultraboosts

great comfort and fit Would recommend to anyone that wants a great wearing shoe

The only small complaint I would have about them is that they can be a tad uncomfortable to wear when sitting long periods especially driving in my opinion However you should not be sitting down when wearing these

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a pair of the ultra boost series shoes

The shoes are very comfortable and can be worn with any fit

The pictures do not do this colorway justice I lost count of how many Ultra Boost I have collected since 2015 The multicolor primeknit and statue of liberty colored heel and cage looks amazing in real life on feet a must for any collector To help people out with size info I am a 13 but have and wear sizes 12 to 13 in the Ultraboost for this 4 0 colorway I highly recommend going down half a size from your true size as I fit in a 12 5 with the insole in place not removed perfectly like a glove and have plenty of stretch to raise my big toes that is a must in any sneaker for me idk why lol Classic shoe buy a pair or a few you will love them

This is my first pair of Ultraboosts and I did not anticipate how comfortable they are I had a pair of pureboosts before and this is actually a lot better on my feet They look great and gave me no foot pain at all

First I had the pureboost which was not as comfy as this ultraboost but now this is the best thing I ever bought

The shoes are great They are super comfortable and the fit is perfect I would highly recommend a pair of ultra boost 4 0 to anyone looking for a nice comfortable pair of sneakers

Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Great shoes and helps out a great cause I just wish I was informed about a small size difference for this particular brand being ParleyXAdidas They do not match the standard Adidas sizing I would need I would normally get a 7 5 but in these I think I need an 8 because my big toe is at the very top of the shoe If I would have known this I would have ordered the 8 Other than that they are great quality shoes

Yes Boosts are costing more and more But they are still one of the best lineups out there Comfiest shoe you will find and unlike so many others this one BREATHS and your feet will not be sweating in 30 minutes

Extremely comfortable and stylish By far my favorite shoes I own I will probably be buying a second pair

I have many ultra boost and wanted this one for the collection Many of the 4 0 have really not stood out but this one did and man I am glad I got it The shoe looks great on foot and kind of reminds me of the reigning ch and 1 0s Best of all support the breast cancer cause

Love the color and the fit and feel of these shoes

No hyperbole Incredibly comfortable sole and shoe

For Parley UBs make sure to go half size up as these tend to be a little more snug than usual on regular UBs

Bc awareness and feels great I love adidas products

It took my son 2 years to find the exact sneaker that he wantedhe finally got these They are perfect for him

Very narrow and unlike the addidas I have had before

Extremely comfortable for an entire day no issues at all

it was a really nice fit and did not have much bad about it

2nd pair of Boost in 2 weeks I bought The Black NYC Bodega ones last week after doing the other big brand for decades These Boost have them beat for comfort hands down Anyhow the fit and finish are perfect to me I do not sweat tiny glue smears as i understand production and it just rolls off with finger easily enough The heel fits great and nice open toe box of this design makes them comfortable wether i wear cushioned no shows or slim running no shows No movement in foot at all Thanks Adidas I love both pairs but am partial to the all black

After 9 months I am going to throw away it because of the awful fabric that now has a lot of ties

The most comfortable sneakers ever These shoes are so light and comfy love them

Great shoes A little snug for wide feet you do not notice it at first may want to go half size up Overall very comfortable with the sock like upper

Came quickly fit perfectly well made and my son loves them

From the Prime Kit upper to the Boost midsole I have no complaints about the shoe Bought as my first pair of Ultraboost and will not be my last

For the price of this shoe the glue holding it together should not be smudged in different areas

Maximum comfort is what I needed and maximum comfort is what I got Adidas really knocked it out of the park with this one

The knit upper is a sturdy material that is soft and stretch The toebox is very roomy and they run true to size unlike others I have tried As for the mid shoe it is been a long time since I have felt secure and support at same time

Really love my Ultraboost I now understand the hype around the comfort these shoes bring I plan on buying more boost shoes soon

I own about 20 pairs of Ultraboost so I really like the shoes This colorway has hints of maroon and green sort of like Mardi Gras colors

Best fit and comfort designed for whole day walking and working

I was not too happy when I opened the box to see the shoe box was damaged

This is a great shoe Very comfortable and the 2 0 upper is hands down the best

I truly love these shoes Originally did not like some of the other ultraboost models but after I bought this pair it is hard to choose anything else

Soft nice design and very comfortable I like it so much

Most comfortable shoes I own I have worn them every day since I got them

Style and fit is amazing Want to buy another pair soon

Glad you guys restocked these Ended up giving away my pair to my cousin when they first came out and this restock was well needed Easily one of my favorite color ways

Ub is one of the greatest sneakers that Adidas had come up with and I really hope they come up with something greater but UB is just extraordinery and amazing

Super comfortable and they look fresh af go all white

Very comfortable and perfect fit I would definitely recommend these shoes

Feels like a cloud use these for going to the gym

These shoes are very comfortable and you can dirty them up as much as you want and they will stay awesome

I love the ultraboost because the mix of colors is lovely and the boost is simply amazing My only problem is that the tongue is a little short so there are marks on my feet after wearing for a long time Overall really excellent product i am satisfied greatly

I keept hearing great thing about ultra boost cushioning So is got myself a pair of ultra boost parley Super comfy really light but I feel a little too tight at the front tongue area after a while it feels like it is blocking my blood from flowing to my legs I was just wondering if anyone felt like that

Words cannot describe how comfortable this shoe is it is perfect one of the best shoes ever made

I love the look of this model but the fit around the ankle is a little less comfortable than 3 0s and 4 0s

One of the best colorways in Ultra Boost history It appears the multicolor is a little darker than the original but other than that it is perfect

Even though I do not like how Adidas is overdoing the ultraboost and undermining them BUT we are talking about this one Ultraboost have really changed the history of sneakersExtra comfortable and so stylish I just wish Adidas appreciate them more and focus more on keeping its value

i totaly love the design and style although the tripple white color way gets dirty easily though my core blacks are probably my favorite pairs of shoes ever

Best purchase Great shoes Very comfortable I would recommended to anyone who looking for light and comfortable running shoes

I love Ultraboost and when I saw that they were rereleasing these I had to jump on them I have found no other shoe that is this comfortable

Very comfortable pair of shoes I would recommend them

comfortable only problem is its hard to slip on esp with socks

Started buying Ultraboost 3 0 and was hooked Happy to see that Adidas is retroing the older models I do not even reallly care for air max anymore Collection of Ultraboost seems to keep growing Love the shoe and would recommend to anyone

Best shoe I have bought Super comfortable and a smooth ride Super clean as well

Nothing better than UltraBoosts can not wait for more of the OG colorways to drop

Great colorway that I could not get at release Kinda hard to keep the ankle collar section clean no matter how much I scrub my ankles but that goes for all white shoes Need more retros Please are release more especially the 2016 Summer Olympics pack Most of us would welcome it if 1 0 2 0 uppers came back and replaced the unsightly whale belly lookin 3 0 4 0 upper entirely

This is one of the best colorways ub 2 0 multi for this model of all time and the boosts comfort is still unmatched

Awesome show love the colors I just wish I would have ordered them a half size bigger

The multicolored pattern makes the show pop overall beautiful shoe

The fact that adidas is using recycled plastic as the shoe material is the main reason I chose this product My feet look good and are saving the world at the same time

The UB Parleys are very comfortable and well designedone thing I would point out though is that the shoe is a bit tight I definitely recommend going half size up but overall a great purchase

I will stay with the PureBoost for running shoes

The shoes look great let us just start with that When they are first put on foot they seem too snug but after wearing for a day the primeknit stretches to your foot perfectly it is not a loose fit so go 1 2 up if you prefer a loose fit but it wraps my foot in all the right ways

Unreal most comfortable shoes on market Will continue to be a customer

This is the best colorway of the Ultraboost and a must have for any sneakerhead as a part of their collection

Literally the most comfortable shoe ever Game changer for sure

Great idea to are release iconic UltraBOOST models

The ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on

because comfort is more important than looks sometimes

Honestly hands down the best ultra boost I have gotten The details and overall color scheme in the shoe is just amazing And comfort come on its boost of course it is the best A all the way

The only complaint I could have is the inside lining ending halfway down the laces ending abruptly when the laces are tied tighter it makes it very uncomfortable

The colorway is just beautiful Quality and comfort is amazing Love them

did not get them the last time they released so it was a must now

If you like walking on marshmallows get these you will be glad you did it

great shoe for everyday wear along with a simple and great look

Extremely comfortable and great everyday shoes for everything

I love the shoe Looks great and feels great The stripes on the side feel a little tight around my foot which is pretty wide but still very comfortable The price is somewhat hard to justify but easily one of the most attractive shoes on the market

You can never go wrong with UltraBoosts They are extremely comfortable and should be a staple for anyonesneaker rotation

I love ultra boost because I love the comfortability of the prime knit Continental soul and of course boost

These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have run in However after about 175 miles the soles are nearly worn through Other shoes I have run in last a lot longer than 5 weeksa dollar per mile is a bit too much

I liked everything and I love them and I love that and I love this and I love that

Great rerelease of a classic color way Color was more apparent in darker lighting as opposed to the flushed out images on the product page Shoe runs more narrow than later versions but was a perfect sock like fit I feel like they used the newer type of boost material too If you missed check your local stores for sitting pairs

Absolutely love this pair of shoes So glad Adidas is are releasing older models like this pair This is my first pair of 2 0 Ultraboost and they fit a little more snug than the 3 0 and 4 0 model but still true to size My new favorite pair of Adidas

the ultraboost is an extremely comfortable and stylish shoe

The fit is like no other shoe all i wear is ultra boost thanks Adidas

I am in love with these shoes Super comfy and fits just perfect

I recommend these as they are absolutely comfortable and look sick

Love the shoe When the 4 0first dropped I knew I had to get a pair I got mine in the gray colorway and fits perfect I have small wide and flat feet so glad that it fit me perfectly Perfect as a running shoe and a lifestyle shoe Great materials should last you awhile I have had mine for a year and it still looks brand new

I just bought these shoes and wore them for the first time today I love the fit of them and the go together with a lot of my outfits I am going to wear them everyday I can

Because this is very nice color I see it last year I wish one day I can cop it and now I have all ready thanks for restock it

Nice shoes I would buy them again

My son is an athlete and he says this shoes is one of the most comfortable shoes he has worn

Awesome silhouette Get the limited collaborations if you can The materials on the Consortium parcks are really good

Absolutely recommend this shoe Shoes are like wearing a sock Ultimate comfort and can wear with anything Good materials

Ever since my first pair of ultra Boost I can not get enough

The Adidas Ultraboost is one of the most comfortable shoes you will ever put on your feet there is no denying that boost put this shoe far above everything else on the market The knit is a fantastic blend that stretches with every step keeping your foot in a sock like grip I am so glad I was able to cop a pair of grails that I missed out on in 2016

This is my favorite UB colorway and the comfort is too good

Ultraboosts in general provide some of the most cushioning in a shoe I personally have encountered without the need to break in like some competing shoes These specific limited edition version come imbued with a reflective material in the mesh that also make for a great aesthetic

This product embodies every quality of a perfect running shoes while also feeling like a comfortable shoe for casual wear It has a sock like upper but still keeps hold of your foot well when running in terrain I can not take them off

Looks super good and is extremely comfortable I also like how it supports beast cancer awareness It is nice for a big company like Adidas to spread awareness for an ongoing disease affecting thousands 5 stars

Really comfortable i prefer if it would come in all black

What I like about these shoes are also that they look very nice for lifestyle

CONSNONE

great value on a great product in a great brand as always

This product has the best cushion of any shoes I own They are great for running and stylish enough to just wear around

Small and narrow cant say if they are comfortable or not was not able to wear them Cause they are small

These ultra boosts are the most comfortable sneakers that I have ever worn and everyone needs a pair

Boost is life it is pretty well known now but it is just as great as ever These Ultraboosts are the perfect blend of knit upper comfortable step in and walking comfort and style does not hurt that you might be saving a little sea turtle as well

they are a bit tight up near the ankle Hopefully they break in because these are head turners Such a great colorway

Have been a boost fan since 1 0 and still love what the model has to offer

it is pretty tight Length and width are fine but it is tight up near the ankle Hoping it breaks in nice because it is so good looking

The primeknit upper is super comfortable and lightweight the boost midsole is responsive and feels like walking on cloud and the rubber outsole is grippy and I never slipped while wearing them

I can not say whether I like them or not because I never even got to see them they were taken off my porch

Great fit Super comfortable Wear it with my scrubs in the clinic Perfect if you are standing for long periods of time

I have to say I was expecting more from the Ultraboost after all the hype The Boost in the sole is great but this can be had in several other shoes My main problem was fit there is a thick stitch running under the tongue of the shoe at the top of the laces and I found that this irritated the top of my foot to the point of cutting off my circulation in a true to size shoe I even tried going up half a size as well as a full size and while the issue was lessened it still remained I have average arch height so I suspect others also experience this issue to some degree I had to return these and I am sticking with the Ultraboost Uncaged for now which do not have any internal seams or stitches and work great for me

So glad Adidas are released these Colors pop and of course Boost sole is like walking on clouds

Perfectly comfortable and fitting for both narrow and wide feet I like the color combination It is comfortable for running and you will not get blisters

These shoes are extremely comfortable and stylish Never can go wrong with a pair of these

Makes me want to walk around all day Very happy

Amazing My only one shoes not only running but also for everyday work

First of all I can not get enough of the ultra boost series This shoe is AMAZING Love the stitching and how comfortable they are I feel like I am on a cloud when I wear them I would recommend the parley series to anyone such a classy comfortable look to make any outfit look good 10 10

The shoes look and feel great They look good with everything and it is a great buy

Always skeptical of buying expensive shoes not with ultra boost though Comfort and color ways are awesome Boost all day wear for sure

My grandson likes them so well that he now has 2 pair of the same shoe each in a different color

its so comfy and yet so fashionable there also great for working out in

I am a wide footer so I was worried that the Parleys would be too tight for me feet When I initially tried them on they were still a bit tight but I decided to try breaking them in for a week wore them around the house and now they are just as comfy as my other boosts

I bought a pair and the quality is so bad i can see the glue

Love these Ultraboosts Awesome that I was able to get them

Everyone else is Second

These sneakers are super cool Comfy super light great for distance runs Shipped quickly Totally worth the money

Extremely comfortable fit clean design primeknits are just too good to pass up on

The tan color on the heel and sole is more of a peach pink Looks feminine and unattractive Seriously disappointed after receiving this hyped order

Just wish it came with black soles otherwise an awesome shoe

The multicolor 2 0 ultraboosts are really sick in person now its time to add to my collection of boosts

These shoes are so comfy Love the soles it feels like you are walking on a cloud I would not recommend going up a half size like some have suggested I tried that and it felt like I was wearing a clown shoe I got another pair for my true size and they fit perfectly They are pretty snug though wear thin socks

are release of archival styles keeps the hype going Dived into UltraBoost legendary comfort recently More than a dozen pairs later I am a convert

These 4 0 Ultraboost feels great similar to the 1 0 pattern but slightly changed Overall an awesome shoe

Very comfortable and are quality shoes I Recommend

The Ultraboost 4 0s run kinda small but are super super comfortable They are my favorite running shoes

Was looking for a more casual pair of comfort shoes that also were stylish and good looking Had Ultraboost on my radar for the longest time and finally pulled the trigger and was not disappointed A great looking shoe very great comfort as well Also fit true to size

Most comfortable shoe I own Best everyday walkers

love the vibrant colors giving a good look on white knit

Super cool to see the 3M added to Ultraboosts in this way In the daylight it is sorta there then at night you shoes light up



I have never wear Ultra boost before after putting this on I love it

Really nice shoe that fits good It would be a better value if this shoe had a lower price

I use these as one of my everyday shoes They are awesome and comfortable

Ultraboost are crazy comfortable Highly recommend

Great shoes I like the boost technology The most comfy shoes in the market right now

Super fast shipping super awesome shoes great fit

Very comfortable and good looking but where the lace goes through broke after 2 months so I cant where them anymore

This shoe is comfortable as all other Ultra boosts are though they give you that extra feeling of comfort knowing that you helped contribute to saving the oceans

Another one to the ultraboost collection Love them

The shoes are very comfortable one of the best shoes that has boost if you can afford the price tag Must say the heel and get scratched easily if you wear them often

These fit great and are comfortable for my son with his Xcountry running My son is the one who is wearing these These are also great looking

Love it Best tennis shoe ever Love the color material and it is so comfortable

Bought these for my son he absolutely loves them Perfect fit

the shoes are very comfortable but after a long day at band c and they get a bit tough to stand still in but over all one of the best purchases i have made

This pair is awesome Super comfy and lightweight I love them

Product looks good and feels great I will continue to purchase Adidas products I really like adidas designs

These shoes do not hurt my feet one bit which makes them a pleasure to wear

I like it because they look very nice and slick and also are very comfortable Also easy to wash because white gets dirty so easy

I bought these for my son who really lives the style and the comfort of these shoes

This shoe is very narrow While it does expand a little it is nkt quite there for me But I get what I get

The material is not like primeknit it feels just like recycled material

I love the parleys because they are very comfortable and they are made from recycled materials to keep the world clean Adidas needs to make shoes in wide sizes and they need to step up there game in color ways that pop

They look great and feel great Stylish and comfortable

Lightweight Ultraboost that is comfortable and fits like a glove Great style and color combination

Great colors super comfortable great running walking shoe

i bought these for my boyfriend and he has obsessed with them and will not take them off wears them to workout and to dinner help

As Always Ultraboost is an extraordinary sneaker with no doubt but please guys you should state that this one runs 1 2 small I own 4 pair of UB 4 0 and I wear 7 and I bought this one in 7 and it is tight and small and I should have gone 1 2 a size up so be aware of that

Shoes are extremely comfortable and have a nice snug fit but they are very expensive

Best pair of Adidas I have own so far The partnership with parley which uses bottles collected from ocean to make these shoes makes it even better

 am grandson loves them and has gotten many compliments

hurt my feet balls of my feet to run in these

These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever bought They feel like I am walking or running on clouds They are very easy on the knees especially after an intense workout

Love this product every since i put it on foot i fell in love would recommend anyone who not only collect sneaker but who want very very comfortable and good looking shoes

Good but they are ripping apart from the sole within only 2 weeks also the cage is coming undone from the shoe not the quality I was expecting and I only wore them 2 to run in

The tongue of the shoe is sticking into the top of my foot and sort of hurts after a while

The shoe is extremely comfortable and can be used casually or for running Boost is by far the most comfortable cushioning system

The ultra boosts are great shoes but it upsets me that these have sold out so quickly Nothing like going to check out getting to the confirmation page and adidas saying sorry we actually took these from you and sold them to someone else Very disappointed in the quantity released

These shoes are amazing for wearing them regularly to school and work These might be one of the best shoes I have purchase

Love this shoes best cushioning well ventilated and look great Bought one pair for my girlfriend and she loves it too

One of the best shoes I have ever worn you should definitely buy these shoes

Very comfortable and stylish that I bought two pair

I would recommend ultra boost to any and everybody that I care about these are just amazing having looked back since 2016 gosh these are amazingly comfortable nothing makes my happier than a new ultra boost

Super comfortable and stylish i could wear these all day

Feels great on my feet Very comfortable Nice color

It is amazing because it not only looks nice but is so comfortable

Adidas is hiding something They are too comfortable

Love the look comfort slightly little tight small in size but no complaints

Great shoe I ordered a 1 2 size up and they fit perfect

I like the product because they shoes are very comfortable and since I use them for work my feet never hurt and I be looking good as well so thankyou for making an amazing product and keep doing you

There comfy and I love to wear them to school Wish I could get 1 million pairs beacasue I wear those everyday

I bought these for running on hard surfaces and I have been blown away by their comfort and responsiveness A little pricey but worth it to not have shin splints

Buy this shoe it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

They look pretty lit and are hellla comfortable too

Beautiful stylish shoe very well made super comfortable i suggest going 1 size bigger very snug shoe

I like the shoes very much it is high quality shoes Good for everyday use I like the quality of the materials it is very comfortable and stylish My job involves a lot of standing for a long period of time and this shoes help ease all the pressure Overall I am very satisfied with this shoes and the price I paid for I love Adidas and I would buy again in the near future

Low profile But a big enough sole for serious cushioning

Nice good looking shoes to add to your shoe collection

I love the ultra boost as a friend told me it was the most comfterble shoe and I agree recommend to anyone who likes light stylish soft shoes

This shoes is perfect comportable So I expect to release Ultraboost 1 0

I loved this shoe and very comfy would definitely buy again

My son absolutely loves these shoes Very comfortable

The purchase was a birthday gift for my grandchild He loved the shoes He said they fit perfect and were very comfortable I am concerned about him keeping them white and clean He was very impressed that I bought him those shoes

I love ultra boost I just do not like the feel of this shoe too hot for long runs

The Ultra Boost shoes are incredible I have a bad back and bad knees which cause my feet to hurt The technology in the Boost really works for me and I am able to wear the shoes all day at work and they really help my back knees and of course my feet from hurting so much I personally recommend these shoes to anyone I meet know This is all coming from a disabled military Veteran Thank you Adidas for making such a terrific shoe

Great look extremely comfortable Awesome color choices The parley collaborations are always on point and help a great cause Waiting for a white pair with green stripes

Extremely comfortable These are VERY snug out of the box but once they are broken in you will not want to take them off Put them through their paces on a recent transatlantic trip perfect for all day and in flight wear

Super Comfortable I work on my feet for long shifts and it is perfect

Great fit Comfortable Good price for the quality

Unique color scheme great fit looks even better in person

One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever had it is a must buy

Fits like a glove extremely comfortable and sweet design

Shoes are perfect I am a runner and they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever ran in

Use them as work shoes Most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Received a defective shoes The cut of the sole was not right Even though my feet is not wide the shoes width is narrow

Just like any other ultraboosts it is very comfortable Love the design and color of the shoes I am a female who wheres menultraboosts because it is much wider making it much more comfortable for my feet

insole came with non matching pair comfortable and fit well around ankle

I like this product because they are very comfortable and are a good running shoe

Best shoes I own they are super comfortable and stylish I would buy again

The shoes look great and are extremely comfortable

Adidas Continental and Parley Max comfort Great style Awesome support

I bought these for my son for his birthday He loves them Best money I have soent

Very comfortable and looks great Really appreciate the effort Adidas has made to use recycled material Quite warm so probably not the best summer shoe

Great comfort and quality Fits perfectly and looks stylish

If you have showings not on the inside making it very uncomfortable to where I am waiting on a return label so I can return the product

dry cushiony and love the continental rubber bottoms

Great product Perfect fit Wish they came in black

great shoe the nubs on the bottom wear down rather quickly white soles are only white for a day thoughthey turn dirty after wearing them

Most comfortable sneaker I ever owned and I have thousands

Very nice quality and supremely cloud like I would 10 10 recommend to anyone else

So much comfort Feel like I am walking on a cloud

Most comfortable shoe I have ever bought and definitely worth the money

After wearing them for a month I can say that these shoes are incredibly comfortable and look great I have the multicolor collegiate navy version which is now sold out online However I have had multiple issues One is the fit I ordered true to size and the length was perfect the width was a bit narrow but the primeknit was so tight that my big toe was sticking out or in this case up I read that the primeknit would stretch out a lot which is why I kept them unfortunately I did not realize that they were talking about the previous versions which were more stretchy I removed the very thick insoles so that the primeknit only pressed on my toes slightly I then stuffed the shoes with paper which made them looser and a bit wider Doing that solved all of my fit problems If you have wide feet I recommend sizing up 0 5 size Some other problems I hadthe heel cup where it says ultra boost got multiple scratches after just a few weeks of wear it is not really noticeable though unless you look closely The cage also got sort of scratched up or worn off I have included a picture I cleaned it but it is still a bit discolored once again it is not very noticeable The boost midsole can get pretty dirty so make sure to clean it regularly All of those problems aside the shoes are incredibly comfortable At first I thought they are comfortable but not THAT comfortable but after wearing them for a month and then putting on my other shoes I now know that Ultra Boosts are definitely the most comfortable shoes ever

Love the light weight and the knit top but the plastic used for the shoe lacing digs into my foot To be returned

They are comfortable and stylish I am a woman but wear the menstyles

I really like this colorway but I hope you produce this colorway with black midsole because it looks a lot better than white midsole overall

They feel comfortable and they look really nice 12

I was looking for the most comfy shoe in the world to walk around in on concrete specifically and just so happened to stumble upon these bad boyz Out of the box these things were good to go for a 12 hour shift moving around on concrete no break in needed The most breathable shoe ever which is always a good thing here in Houston Looks beautiful I do not know what else I could ask for in a shoe

Very comfy Love ultraboosts so much They form to your foot so well

I like the feel but still too tight for my liking I recommend buying a shoe that is a half size larger than your typical purchase

product was everything it was advertised as Fit perfectly and are super comfortable

Walked for miles and felt absolutely no discomfort

It is super comftorable and very light on the feet

If your gonna spend 160 or 140 on a pair of UltraI would buy the Parley editions just cause I know its for a good cause and the quality really shows

its best product adidas its parfect i also like it

boost midsole amazing primeknite amazing love the shoe boost is life

Still very comfortable and fits well enough Helping save the oceans too

First pair of Ultraboost shoes and I love them The color is cool and they feel comfortable

Its is a great shoes and looks super fi but gets dirty very easily

Perfectly comfortable amazing shoe My current favorite shoe

I love how the shoe snugs your feet perfectly Some people prefer wearing it without the soles they are a bit more loose like that but maintain the sock like fit around the ankle Great shoe for running or casual wear

do not get me wrong the shoes are super comfortable the only problem is that after two days the soles show glue marks and seem to be very poorly put together Still the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

The shoe is a little costly but it is definitely worth it The comfort of the shoe is amazing it fits well and looks good to top it off can not get over how comfy they are though

I love the shoe it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

Amazing looking and comfortable sneaker overall Only problem was the ankle support was a bit too tight for me The Climas are probably going to be my go to from now on when it comes to Ultra Boost

The shoe is good but the parley materials did not feel as great as normal materials and the size I got was a bit too small so did not fit too well Boost was great

It was great price and my son loved the shoes He loved the fit and the style

My boyfriend is really big on comfortable shoes so he really loves Ultra Boosts Bought these for him and so far they are his favorite

They feel as good as they look Ultraboosts are the way to go if you want a reliable pair of running or every day shoes

They are unbelievably comfortable and look very sleek at the same time

So comfortable and they look great can not buy a better shoe they are a little big but it is not a huge issue Would recommend

I bought one pair of these shoes and had to get another because they are so comfortable

do not feel the same as my other boosts Slightly more narrow of a entry hole and feel like there is less cushion

I like them and they are comfortable The only issues I have with them is the white sole

After I received my Ultraboosts 4 0s I was a little disappointed when I noticed all of the manufacturer glue spots on the shoes They are extremely comfortable and stylish but I wish they would have had less glue spots Overall good shoes

Simple design No obnoxiously large logos Clean

I love ultra boosts and these are no exception They definitely need to stretch when you first wear them but besides that there amazing

These things feel amazing worth every single cent There is no turning back I hope your wallet is ready

Despite Adidas usual problem of shoes running half a size large this is still the most comfortable shoe out there

Awesome shoes Stylish and COMFORTABLE will not regret your purchase

I have bought a couple pairs of ultraboosts and enjoyed them all The parley is one of the best running shoes I have ever purchased at first it might be tight and narrow but it eventually becomes very comfortable and a great shoe to work out with I will definitely continue to purchase ultraboost products in the future

This is the first pair of ultraboost I have purchased and certainly will not be my last The most comfortable shoes I have ever walked in

There is not a single show in the market that I believe is more comfortable than the Ultraboost

Good fit and comfortable shoe It could use improvement in the sole padding by adding some pores so you can wear the shoe sock less My feet sticks to the bottom and gets sweaty if I do not wear socks

Where Comfort meets Style Third pair of Adidas Ultra Boost what more do I need to say

Really like this shoe but ended up having to return it because the toe box is just too small on them Anyone getting these should definitely go up a half size

I love the style of this shoe This is my first pair of Ultraboost so it took some getting used to as compared to Boosts It fits snug around my foot but has stretched out a bit and now it is perfect

Love this shoe I have had many before great product

I liked it for the comfort but i feel that it was a little over hyped

I am writing this review when the shoes are 140 US dollars which is just awesome Personally I do not think the pictures do the shoes justice The upper material has a more aqua ish color than is seen in the pictures And the plastic threads do not make much of a difference in comfort Great shoes overall and even greater cause with Parley

The best shoe I have ever purchased Just make sure to get 1 2 size larger

Very comfortable and unique with the materials used

What I wanted in the shoes but I have to enter minimum number of text to submit this review

I walk a lot and this shoe is perfect cusion needed

Purchased as a gift and it is the best ever So good he does not want to wear them

Best fitting cushioned all day wearing type of shoe Best purschase ever

I recommend this shoes for run long distance or every day used

I love the shoe except it is a little tight on the top of my left foot I have 6 pair of Boost and this is the only one with that issue

So far I have worn these for walks around the neighborhood and the comfort is good I measure an 8 would on the Brannock Device and find an 8 1 2 in this style to be a comfortable fit The support is a bit lacking due to the soledesign to squishOverall these are comfortable athletic shoes

GREAT SHOE COMFY ALL DAY LONG ON CONCRETE GOOD FOR RUNNNING

Sadly having to return these They fit tighter than my normal Ultraboost Otherwise the shoe is gorgeous and I love Adidas making products with recycled materials

The soles help with my flat feet Feels like bouncing around when you walk

Very cushiony Soft upper feels like a sock Question long term durability though

Supporting the environment and very comfortable shoes

I love the colorway and while the cage is different and the whole shoe is not as customizable as plastic caged UBs it is still very comfy and feels great for walking or standing in I wish it came with a second set of laces that are the same color as the heel cup

Recommended if you are into the colorway As my first pair of UB I did not know what to expect other than comfort I wish I had gotten the laceless UB instead

Bought the parley boost as a gift for my daughter bday and she loved it and what it stood for

I love adidas All I am really trying to do is be a walking billboard for them I do not know what it is about their marketing c and aign but it got me hook line and sinker Love the products Keep it up

The color way is very nice This is my second pair of ultraboosts

I got these for both running and for everyday casual wear I love the comfort color and design But I had to order a half size up since the shoes are tight Otherwise it is an awesome pair to be wearing around

I like this product because it is a good running shoe that also looks good

Great product little expensive but worth it I would recommend to anyone for running and casual wear

The colour way is nice but too narrow If you went half size up you will get alots of toe room If you went true to size and you have wide foot you might want to take off your insole

The shoe is very comfortable But it gets dirty pretty easily

I have been wanting some Ultraboost shoes for a good while and I am so happy that I finally did I love the Parley collaboration it makes for a good talking point because people WILL tell you that your shoes look cool Sizing is perfect I did go up a half just for my personal preference but I would have done fine with a standard 10 5 I work at a grocery store and have put some heavy wear and miles in them already after a month and while they naturally have gotten dirty they feel brand new every time I slip them on

lil more snug than normal ultra boost feet fall asleep after a short bit maybe just have to understand that i need to sacrifice comfort for supreme style if you catch my drift

The product is extremely well made comfortable and looks great

Extremely versatile Stylish and performs Have two pairs and might get a third

Besides being a bit small and narrow this is my favorite purchase I have ever made Parley is an amazing partnership for adidas to have and will hopefully change how people choose what to wear

I started with a pair of Ultraboost STthat I have had for about a year and decided to go ahead and purchase two pairs of UltraboostWhile these and the STdiffer both are great shoes and I love the little differences between them These shoes are almost like walking on clouds

I have seen some reviews of this shoe concerning the durability of the sole so I will have to see how it holds up

The top of the shoe is so tight that I feel it would kill my nerves if wearing for a prolonged period After only a couple of mile with them on I started feeling tingling and numbing on the foot due to the nerve and tendon cutoff caused by the tight top Although the boost midsole is comfortable I am still gonna return them as the tight top is really a deal breaker to me

I liked the product though it was too big Wish I could have ordered a 10 5 for the same price

I like it it is very comfortable and very good for casual wear

This are the best shoes so far i have bought they feel good and for the first time i tried this They are comfortable and are true to size One thing i kind of dislike is that putting your foot inside the shoe does take some time to get in because they are a little tight from the show hole but besides that great shoes for running

I liked everything up to the heel were there was like a thicker fabric as the support instead of the usual plastic heel support

Love them The color is my favorite I do want another pair of these shoes just a different color

They look great and the ultra boost is really comfortable but the upper was extremely constricting I even ordered 1 2 size up It was okay if I was standing or walking but if I sat at my desk after a little while my toes would start to get numb This is even with them completely unlaced Had to return

The shoe is awesome I would recommend anyone to buy Ultra boosts

beautiful shoe fits perfect great design and overall great purchase

I respect what adidas is doing with the Parley movement so it made sense to purchase The ran a little snug but once I took the insoles out perfect I can walk for hours and not feel the strain on my feet

Comfy Shoes Great Look Great Fit Would Highly Recommend

Good sneaker wish it was sized more appropriately

Shoes are very comfortable for daily activities and they look great They shoes also hold up in the long run

I think it is amazing they are made out of ocean plastic the blue design is pretty awesome the first few times I wore them they were pretty tight but now it fits perfect after a week of breaking them in Wearing them at work right now

Colorway is awesome and goes great with ER scrubs Looking good and saving the oceans

I am still experiencing a tingling sensation in foot

I am very glad I bought a half size up These shoes are very comfortable and have great support but they are narrow and in my opinion run small The opening is also kind of small and there is no way to make it bigger If you have wide feet these would be a poor choice of shoes They are very good running shoes though

The shoes are comfortable and a good looking shoe too

They took a few days to break in comfort fit wise So at first I was not sure about the ultra boost hype but now all my other shoes are disappointing to put on

I love the look of these shoes but I have flat feet and these do not have much in terms of arch support

First time tryin out Ultr Boost I am impressed and they are worth the money A shoe that you can wear anywhere

I always wear the same size for adidas but the parley seems to be narrower which makes it less comfortable compared to my other ultraboost I am not sure if half a size bigger would have made it better

The cushion is awesome and the quality is great Makes it feel like I am running on a mattress

This is my sons favorite athletic shoe They are the most comfortable shoe for sports or leisure

I have enjoyed many complements on these sneakers It is neat I can share a story of it being manufactured from ocean from the ocean I feel that this purchase helped our world and that feels good The shoes are Ok the plastic feels thin and the innersole keeps coming out So far they remain clean however I am not sure how long that will be I am also not sure how long I can go without a solid surface on the outside

Very satisfied with purchasing these ultraboost they look awesome in hand very stylish with great comfort and you help out a little with cleaning ocean plastic its a win win for everybody

Comfortable high quality conforms well to your foot and the boost is real nice

Recycled ocean plastic great Make the yeezy buying process more fair please

Perfect blend of comfort and style plus going to a good cause 10 10

Really Comfortable shoes Great for running and look good for lifestyle wear Love the environmental story behind the shoes

I own a couple NMDs and people always told me UB was more comfortable Gonna have to agree True to size also but if you are between sizes I would recommend going bigger I wear 11 5 12 and 12 is sometimes too big in Adidas ie Dame 4s alphabounce but these are pretty snug in 12

I love the boost and quality of these shoes The only thing I am kinda neutral about are the cages not a big fan of them I love the cages from your 1 0 3 0

I love the boost it is a good shoe to workout in as well

Ultraboost has the best comfort of any shoe I have tried yet

Not really feeling the colorway but the feel is where it is at and they were on sale so why not right

Fits much better than the uncaged more reinforced than the others

It fits a bit narrow I guess because the knit is brand new However after a few 5k runs they get the so much confy If you want to go run and still look cool THIS is the shoe

Always like ultra boost but for me they tend to run small

I have not used these for running yet but they are so incredibly soft and comfortable to wear around Love the sock like feel I feel as though they had be perfect for slower paced recovery runs too Well done Adidas

I only have a pair of 4 0 Ultraboosts to compare them to but I would say size up a half size as the upper seems a little tight I only have one wear in them so no complaints other than that so far I love the collaboration between Parley and Adidas and also the aesthetics of the shoe They look better on foot than in pictures as well

it is comfortable and breathes well I will probably buy again

Im not going to lie i got these shoes for my buddybirthday They look great absolutely quality He really enjoys them and their comfort

Comfy I like the increase upward curved angle on forefoot and toe Doing the environment good is a plus

Aside from saving the environment the comfort of these shoes is outstanding

Love supporting eco friendly are use of materials in a stylish and comfortable product Wish they did this more often

These are most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The upper is like wearing grandmas hand knit socks The boost lower is like walking on clouds made of trampolines I am only worried that I may wear them out too fast because I wear them everywhere Also I wear an 11 11 5 ordered an 11 5 probably could have done an 12

Picked these up a few weeks ago and have been wearing them often I went half size up compared to nmds and most other Adidas sneakers I own and the fit was perfect I have moderately wide feet and these accommodated me nicely pure boosts for example never quite worked out for me as far as fit The upper has a comfortably snugly fit and you can honestly get away with wearing these with the laces loose

The shoes are great They are comfortable but a bit tight The only problem I have is the insole is very loose and when taking your foot out the insole can fall out

There is a plastic toecap inside the shoe that catches on my toenails when I wear thin socks such as no shows Most comfortable midsole of any shoe I have ever owned and the upper fits like a sock

The Parley is executed perfectly and for a good cause

Great quality very comfortable and perfect for running 

I like this product cause I tried many different kind of running shoe and walking shoe so far this best product I purchased

I like it for the look and feel of the shoe The foam is very different from other shoes The only complaint is they are pretty narrow and run small

I loved these shoes I have been looking for some adidas to go with my joggers and these are great So comfortable and they look so good at the same time Definitely planning on getting more soon

I truly believed that I had the best looking UltraBoost until these Anniversary ones came out The 3M over the whole shoe is beautiful

Most comfy shoes I have ever owned not to mention they look dope Love them

I should preface this review by saying that I am not an advanced or hardcore runner I am trying to get back into running after a few years of neglect I have gone through several pairs of running shoes though and these were not just good in my opinion Holy smokes I have never worn running shoes that were this comfortable before This is probably in part due to the fact that these are my first experience with Adidas Boost which I now see is widely recognized as exceptional It is extremely cushiony and springy when I run and just generally nice feeling This model which I have found elsewhere is a clima model though it is not explicitly stated on the website that I could see does have incredible ventilation It is summer and it is hot and when I run in these it is like there is a fan blowing on my feet Lastly I am not in love with Adidas running shoes looks I think just about everybody else does a better job This is completely personal preference and I am sure there are plenty of people who would disagree Having said that among Adidas running shoes these are some of the best looking The white is nice but it is better because of the blue undertones which are much more visible in person than they are in pictures I just think that these are good looking shoes Do they get dirtyI am a sure they will but I have about 20 miles in them so far and they look fine I imagine a good mud puddle would change that though

Its fits perfectly I can run faster wearing these shoes

always happy with ultraboost shoes they fit me just right and are super comfortable now I am also helping to keep plastic waste out of the oceans

UBs are extremely comfortable and feel very stable in the heel and arch once you get the correct size it is a bit of a chore to sneak your foot into them but they stabilize well around your heel achilles ankle when on

Great quality need wide widths Comfortable when laced as lose as possible

This is my second pair of Ultraboosts and I love them just as much as the first it is comfort style and durability make it literally the perfect shoe for anything your day throws at you

This is the best and I will always get these shoes over anything

Good comfortable well worth the money However it only cost adidas 46 dollars to make this shoe

This shoe is very versatile in the sense that it is stylish enough to be used as a lifestyle shoe as well as comfortable enough to be a used as a running shoe

Responsible great looking fit great comfortable

Feels great and is very comfortable but if you have a wide food you should probably go half a size or a size up

Best shoe I have ever own everyone should own one of these

These shoes are like heaven on my feet The Boost cushioning is springy and light The knit upper has a slight elasticity that hugs the foot Both of these factors contribute to the vet Boosts being the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I had some reservations about the price tag but after trying them on they are worth every penny I will just have to take good care of them to make sure they last

This is really great shoe of comfort for step I take it is like stepping on clouds you can also wear them as casual of ou like but be careful on not getting dirty with types of liquids because it can leave a stain on the plastic and fabric But truthfully every shoe is like that Shoes are meant to be dirty in time anyway Again this shoe is amazing but it is very tight in time it will be lose it is like wearing socks but it is a little bit thicker But that is normal if it is tight on you Overall really great shoe to wear

Quality product for a great cause I love the Ultra Boots fit

These shoes look great I love the colors with the exception of the always dirty white outsole The problem is that the Earth Day 2018 Parley UltraBoost with the teal mint colored fabric heel cup have a different material on the inner collar and sock liner that is not nearly as plush or comfortable as most 4 0or 3 0It is more of a mesh material on these which irritates my ankle I will also reiterate what some other reviewers have said which is that the fabric heel cup on these is also noticeably tighter than the plastic counters on most UltraBoost which may provide a little better lockdown but is not as comfortable Finally although I do like the look of the fabric cage I do not like that it is slightly shiny and it often bends into odd positions because it is not as stable as the usual plastic rubber ones For these reasons I will likely be returning these which is a shame because I really do like them otherwise While I can not recommend this specific pair I do recommend any other pair of UltraBoost this is the first pair I have come across that I did not like

Great looking shoes nice color Very comfortable definitely buy another pair

Nothing beats the comfort of the boost technology

The best adidas shoe I have purchased so far I love the style and they are incredibly comfortable They are extremely light and incorporate the climacool experience perfectly Definitely recommend to anyone

Bought them for my boyfriend because we love the ultra boost material We both own several pairs because they are literally the most comfortable shoes we have ever worn in our lives We liked the message behind the Parley shoe and the colors are super cute

Wish I ordered half a size larger than normal Slightly tight on top of my foot Trying to stretch it out by putting inserts in while not wearing still have not seen the results yet

I loved the product super soft and stylish but unfortunately they ran one whole size too small

If you want to walk a 100 miles and look and feel good in every step buy these shoes

Ultra Boost has got to be the most comfortable shoe I have ever set foot on The amount of Boost in them is just phenomenal The materials used and the build quality are excellent Me wearing this pretty much every day despite the minimalistic design speaks to how dope they look and how ridiculously comfortable they are But this color way in particular has got to be the coolest Ultra Boost of all time The photos do not give them justice Trust me just get them and see and feel for yourself I have bought one for myself and one for my dad and I have never seen him more hyped about a shoe ever Definitely satisfied with this purchase

The pics are a bit misleading where I thought these were more on the black grey side Turns out they are green I usually wear size 10 but I had to order 10 5 even then the shoe is tight in my right foot I guess with more use it will loosen up

My first UB 4 0 This shoe meets expectations as usual I have wide and thick feet muscle of course and I could probably go up half a size but it is not much of a problem Quality is on point for an UB The 3M is a nice touch

They yellow in the soles on the boost and the cage basically unwearable because they look nasty after only 1 year DO NOT BUY

They are bretty cheap but look expensive

My first adidas shoe was a harden vol 1 and I loved them other than they were a tad too small and they kind of tore apart on the inside of the ankle part of the shoe because of this So on this shoe I ordered a 1 2 size up and it fit perfect I love these shoes I wear them every where Even around the house I will for sure order another pair some day If the price comes down I guarantee they would sell even more and faster And I would probably order my next pair even sooner But alas They are pricey

Hard to find stuff to where with them but super clean

This is without a doubt the most comfotable shoe I have ever owned The style the comfort and the fit are all perfect 10 10 would recommend

I love these shoes but there is only one issue I bought them in the summer where it so hot in them

I love these shoes Feels like i am walking on a cloud great support and comfort and look great too

I do like the product but I was a little underwhelmed by the craftsmanship of the shoe A few glue stains and the toebox is different on each shoe which is disappointing for a very expensive shoe Comfort is amazing however

Love the shoe Comfortable shoe good for running to Love the idea of the shoe history and how it was made

When I got this in the mail I was expecting what I have seen in the quality from the ultra boost line in other non parley editions Not only does it really make me feel better by helping the environment but it also feels easily just as comfortable if not more so than regular ultra boosts but it is also surprisingly lighter than the usual shoe I think due to the use of fabric rather than plastic in the cage structure Well done Adidas

It feels great on my feet The shoes also looks stylish

Love Ultraboost and the climacool is a nice addition

I bought these shoes because I was tired of running shoes from other companies These shoes have been my go to for the past two weeks because they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had It truly is such a comfortable step each time I walk I took 23 000 steps yesterday in them and my feet felt just fine I am looking to buy more of these in the future

Worst adidas ever do not buy waste of money go with one of their other shoes

The soles of the shoes are super comfy as with all ultraboosts But I felt that the elastic at the top of your foot around your ankle the area that is pulling the shoe down was too tight I have to take occasional breaks Hopefully they will stretch out a bit

These shoes are rad Super comfortable and love that they are helping the environment

Aesthetically flawless Legend Ink color way is very classy yet understated Build quality and utilized materials are unbeatable Most comfortable sneakers I have owned However the fit is rather snug A half to a full size up is recommended Highly satisfied with this purchase

It is very comfortable and it is is the best color way i have ever seen

These shoes are comfortable quality is on point look good and draws everyone attention as soon as you walk in the room By far the best pair of shoes that I have ever bought and would recommend them to anyone looking for something that makes a statement yet is comfortable and breathable

They are pretty good I like the way they fit I will recommend this

I love these running shoes I also like the fact that they are helping the environment My entire family now has the Parley style

The Parley collaboration and the comfort made it an easy choice

Extremely comfortable shoe with great style Fits my lifestyle and reason for using this great shoe

They run narrow and about half size small but great show overall plus love they are made from recycled materials

I own 5 pairs currently browsing the site for the 6th Wide footer so went 1 2 size up Perfect fit then LOVE them

I like the shoe very much and would recommend it to friends

Nice shoe that came quick for a decent price Highly recommended

Toe box very cr and ed Difficult to wear shoes all day without sore feet Very tight across top of foot as well The sole is very comfortable though

Very comfortable great to run in looks great too

Absolutely awesome shoes for doing pretty much anything active or any work with lots of moving around Extremely comfortable supportive breathes very well I do not think any other shoe will replace this as my go to

I bought nmd r1 2 and ultraboost The ultraboost does perfect support rather than nmd r1 and 2 I really recommended you guys who have some foot issue to buy ultraboost as well

You just can not go wrong with boost

It was so light and comfy that I bought 3 more pairs for my family

I like the product for walking and jogging My feet have enough room and I never feel pinching on my toes

These are the best runners I have bought from Adidas yet Super comfortable and you can not lose with it being made from recycled plastic from the ocean could not ask for a better combo

I have 4 pair of these shoes that is how great they are That said and I do not know why but the Parley shoes fit even better than the regular Ultra Boosts I have two each I wear size 12 and the non Parley shoes are just little tight width and length for my liking so I end up not wearing them as much That said still the best show I have ever owned I wish I could afford more of them

The color the comfort and the durability can not wait for the next anniversary sure to come out to add to my collection

I have wanted to purchase these shoes for quite some time Always delaying thinking that the price was a little high for a pair of sneakers Glad I finally pulled the trigger These shoes are so comfortable they make all my other shoes seem like garbage Ultra Boost for the win

I owned 2 Ultra boast and tgey are really good and very comfortable I will try Yezee next time

Great shoes all around Really comfortable and versatile

These shoes are like walking on clouds and these specifically have the coolest reflective effect Highly recommend

I like this product because it fits perfectly on your feet and the air holes keep your feet nice and cool Also i like how it is a shoe that is in a way helping the environment

it is now just aethetics The quality comfort and materials are worth the purchase Not my first boost definitely not the last

Very happy with my purchase so far The shoes look even better in person I was worried they would be too dark but the blue looks really good They do fit snug but not in an uncomfortable way They just feel secure I am a bit worried about how long the tread will last but so far so good

These shoes feel like fluffy clouds beneath your feet Definitely worth the buy

it is durable and suitable for both males and females

I have been eyeing up ultraboosts for quite some time now and finally pulled the trigger on the parleys I was not disappointed These shoes are the BOMB They look great and are comfortable I have heard they run a tad bit smaller than regular boosts but I still ordered my true to size and it was fine

too difficult to get on because it does not have a tongue Too narrow

Love the style and feel of the shoe looks great with anything

Great balance and comfortable Would like to see the 3 stripes right below the tongue that will be cool Very cool looking shoes I must say

Comfortable for daily use especially for a college student who walks around campus much needed shoe

Super comfortable shoe that looks great with pretty much anything Not typically a sneaker guy but I reach to put these on almost every day

Great shoe very comfortable feels like you do not have shoes on

Looks great feels great I am already planning on buying more

soooo comfy and i get a lot of compliments on them

The color way is just amazing The blue complements the white very nicely And if talking about comfort WOW UltraBOOST beat out the competition by margins BOOST is the new way to go If you are not wearing boost you are pretty much walking on foam while BOOST are like clouds

they are pretty comfortable but they do not hold up with everyday wear White bottom section is peeling and does not look great The upper sections of the shoe look better however some of the nit looks bad sticking out Just not sure if they are worth the money

I really enjoyed the comfort and the aesthetics great tennis

Easy purchase comfortable shoe love the fit

Good quality probably the coolest shoe that i have worn and most comfortable

Extremely comfortable and light but also very durable

I wanted to add a Clima Ultraboost to my collection for the summer and when I saw this white Parley collab I had to get it The material feels slightly thinner than other ultraboost but in combination with the holes in the toe box makes the shoe super breathable great for wearing without socks Pictures do not do these shoes justice the blues in the upper and the cage pop so much more in person The nfc chip in the heel counter is also a cool little touch Every pair of shoes has an individual code and it says when it was manufactured It also gives you a link so you can see the process of how the shoes were created

There are my first pair of Ultraboosts Tried to purchase the non Parley model but they were all sold out in my size I had been having some lower leg discomfort running with the Adizero Bostons but immediately felt at ease on my5 mile runs in the Parleys

This shoe really stands out love the colorway Every shoe enthusiasist should own a pair of these

Best boosts I have purchased to date Breatheable and stylish

Love that Adidas is using recycled materials Need to see more of that as a standard

I initially ordered a size 14 my actual size in the ultraboost 4 0 and when I got it the shoe was way to small I had to go up a full size and I must say most comfortable shoe I own other than V2 350 The size 15 fit perfect I had never owned any ultraboost series til now and it is well worth it so if you wondering go up at least half size I went up a whole size and it is perfect

NEver buy the blueish gray ones because they are super ugly no joke Overall very comfortable shoes

Awesome shoes amazinly comfy and made from recycled plastic I almost wanna buy a couple more

this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and I love the way it looks

Confort and materials Can run and walk forever Will purchase an other pair

I bought this product with the intent to sell I immediately fell in love and could not sell them I now love to wear them and would recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of shoes

From the moment I saw the shoes while I unboxed the box I fell in love with them From the pleasant aroma to seeing the pure whiteness of the shoes it was i mean IS PERFECT

Gen 3 Comfortable shoes the support is not great on uneven terrain Had ankle issues when hiking Koko Head Great for inner city activity like work gym or running on level sidewalks Also the upper shoe or v and is easily un threaded Still most comfortable shoes I own

I was wondering if Im a size 11 what size should I get 11 or 11 1 2

Ever wonder what it feels to walk on cloudsBuy this shoe I will never buy another pair of shoes again if it is not ultraboost I hope they bury me with them

Comfy and elegant shoes Would definitely recommend for those on the look

Undisputed comfort and styling Had them for 2x days and I have received too many compliments to list here The white is a nice shade of white and the Parley aqua comes through nicely Note that as these are Climacools the color of your sock will show through on the toe

This shoe is super comfortable and stylish I recommend this when you are going out with friends or family

These shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I owned and you will not feel tired or hot after wearing this shoe all day The 3M they put in the shoes are very nice hint to the style of the shoes and how they glow in the light They seem to be made out of good materials Overall worth the money if purchasing the shoe if you are looking to spend this much

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn that does not sacrifice good looks

Feedback from my son comfortable but very slippery during wet weather he has slipped couple times in his school

I like this shoe a lot and mostly because of how comfortable it is and it is ability to be cleaned I bought the white ultraboosts I believe they look the best unlike most white shoes the can be cleaned really easily

So much do that I bought 2 pairs and about to purchase a third in 2 weeks

I am on my second pair of Ultraboosts and they are definitely my go to shoe in my closet They are comfortable just wearing around the office and running and working out A couple of minor complaintsthe price prevents me from buying these more often I also feel static shocks more frequently in boosts but that might just be me Lastly the white sole on boosts are difficult to keep clean But none of these points will prevent from are buying

this is the most comfertable shoe in the world and thats IT gtgtgtgtgtgtgt 

These shoes are simply incredible They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I would truly describe them as bed for your feet Your feet rest on a thick soft and responsive bed of boost while being softly covered by a snug and supportive blanket of soft prime knit They are also very stylish Incredible shoes

It is really comfortable for walking long distance

Shoe was a half size if not a full size too large The shoe was incredibly tight around the ankle to the point where it was unwearable but with time that could possibly change I would highly recommend a different pair of UltraBoost before ever suggesting this set to someone else

Shoes look nice Wish they were made like the rest of the ultra boost I own when it comes to sizing

They are hot and everything I wanted I would recommend them to everyone

Very light and sleek a great modern style I loved them

Able to be out all day in a city and not have achy feet after

Its supporting getting rid of pullution and im all for it

most comfortable shoes ever like walking barefoot on cushions

Great fit and comfort for leisure wear or running or walking

Cut too small and narrow had to go to a local store to return and settle for a different shoe

Absolutely love these shoes Fit perfect The boost is super comfy They look great They are an all around win

it is really comfortable and perfectly designed for running They feel great but the cage gets scratched really easily

This is my 3rd pair of Ultra boosts and these are my favorite They are the most comfortable shoe I have put on my feet Keep it up Adidas I will continue to buy these

Debated this for a while but very happy with my purchase

I have another pair of ultraboosts but these are my favorite I bought these and wore them to Magic Kingdom Put 17 miles on them in 3 days of walking Zero foot ache and no back ache

Great shoe the most comfortable shoe I own and very good looking

Style and comfort sold me on this shoe It feels like you are walking on clouds

Stylish Comfortable Needed support comfort and a boost for my HIIT and cross fit workouts These sneakers delivered on all I have been a lifetime Nike wearer So happy that I have Adidas a try Try them you all love them

My second Ultra Boost LTD Both shoes are impeccable

Overall the shoe is a great looking and feeling shoe I brought the triple white model a couple of weeks ago and it still looks and feel good My only dislike about this shoe is that the left over glue residue gets stained with a brownish color that can not be washed out Hopefully someone can tell me a way to take that stain out

Shoes are really comfortable They are a good all day walking shoe

Extremelly comfortable and beautiful Simply the best to walk

I have always had great luck with adidas these shoes are the most comfortable pair i have owned

This shoe is the most comfortable she that I have ever owned I only buy Adidas now

These shoes look and feel great IF you order a half size larger My Adidas NMD and I 5923 shoes all feel a bit large in a size 9 but the Ultras feel incredibly tight I ended up going with a 9 5 and they still feel tighter than a size 9 in the other Adidas models

Comfortable asf they look cool and overall just a really dope shoe

This product is incredible I use these shoes for work where I walk 8 10 miles a day in them It feels like walking on a cloud They fit perfectly and are true to size I highly recommended these shoes to everyone

A great shoe to wear all day feels like walking on supportive marshmallows

Shoes feel tight Air goes right through and feel comfortable

These shoes are amongst the most comfortable things you all ever put on your feet I have had house slippers that were less comfortable

Feels very comfortable Best purchase for shoes ever that are high quality shoes

they are nice just too tight Not as cushiony as expected

1 2 size up was most comfortable but true size was best for exercise I am a 10 5 in all my nike adidas shoes and cleats For ultraboosts I really liked going 1 2 size up because the extra width made it more comfortable but a little too long at the toes Buying true to size was the best overall fit but just feels a little tight around the footarch area especially the sides and top of foot

I will decide after the stretching is completed the sizing on these shoes is inconsistent

most comfy shoe ever fits like a glove walks like a dove

So so comfortable and versatile Strongly recommended for walking around town or siting at home i still typically run in my nike pegasus

This is an amazing shoe that I think everyone should have The boost makes every step enjoyable and the ride is smooth as clouds The primeknit upper is very breathable and stretchy making the feel of the shoe even better The cage gives lots of support where needed and wraps around your foot for stability This shoe is incredible and after buying multiple pairs I just can not take them off my feet

I love everything the shoe stands for I bought it right after graduating college with a Biology degree because it just felt right and felt even better when I put them on foot

It looks great and fits amazingly it is like walking on a cloud

I am a nurse and walk 3 6 miles over a 12 hour shift First off shoe is noticeably a 1 2 size too small Even after sizing up the top of my foot is too tight but since it is a sock fit there is no way to loosen it I had a lot of heel and back pain trying to break these in but after 3 weeks the pain got better But I need good arch support from my rigorous work environment and although the sole is bouncy there is no arch support whatsoever None Good for young people with healthy legs but not for anyone else I am going back to my Asics Gel Nimbus

for money

I had these shoes for 3 days and thought they were the best shoes ever They are so comfy but the sole quality is awful They were great for normal jogging but when I was doing sprints the sole literally split apart

great purchase great shoe I love addidas merchandise

Very comfortable breathable and lightweight I have always been a fan of the Swoosh brand but thought I would try these out since I live my Adidas gold shoes I already bought another pair for when these wear out

 gtgtgtgtgtltltltltltltlt 

The comfort level and amazing sole perfect in my eyes

These shoes are incredibly comfortable and form fitting They are light and feel like I am walking on air Really awesome that these are made with recycled ocean plastics we need more companies making products like this 100 recommend buying

Like walking on a cloud Would definitely recommend this shoe

The material used is of high quality It is like walking on clouds when you are wearing it

I love it and would highly recommend it Easily the best shoe on the market

Amazing shoes fully recommended they are dope af and the comfort is outstanding

Shoe fit tts for me On this colorway the 1 0ish toe box is not as visible as others I really like having the light blue heel cup Comfort is boost so nuff said Hopefully get some brighter or solar colorways in the future Overall 5xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8 def recommend

I really recommend this shoe because boost the heel cup and laces system are all well made and fit perfectly The shoe looks fashionable with the silver boost and a great purchase for me

they are so comfortable and I would buy these again

The shoes are so comfortable They are the comfiest shoes I have ever bought They fit well and they are very durable I have one pair that I have been wearing for about 9 months now and they are still in great condition I would highly recommend getting a pair

My second pair of Ultra Boosts and they are my favorite shoes

The downside about not having a separate tongue on the shoe is that the opening is not adjustable The shoe is very comfortable except for the opening which was so tight my whole foot started going numb I returned and went up a size still too small The next size up I would have been wearing clown shoes so I returned them and called it quits I guess I am not destined to be hip

I love these shoes they are actually my favorite I got the white and black pair the day that they dropped and I wear them every day However my left shoe is already coming apart it is really dissapointing because I love these shoes I hope adidas can do something to help me out

Super comfortable but I have flat feet so the shoes look a little weird on me but its still a bomb shoe Wore it to my orientation and it felt like I was walking on clouds all day

Overall I love these shoes 5 5 10 10 5 Stars etc The most comfortable shoes I will ever wear Be sure to go half a size up for this generation of Ultraboost I usually wear a size 9 I bought size 9 5 and they fit perfectly with the right amount of snug

Bought this as a gift and it was very well received

Great running shoes Very happy to recommend this product

I bought the shoe maybe two months ago I have only worn them about 5 or 6 times because the weather had been so bad in Minnesota and I have tried to take as good of care of them as I could but one day while taking them off I noticed a tear along the bottom of the shoe the boost had started to rip away from the shoe i was very excited about the shoe I have heard nothing but good things about the ultraboosts but very disappointed in the quality

This is my second pair of ultra boost and I am happy

Best shoe ever since I was born the best ultra boost

My first pair of ultraboost Very comfortable Now I understand all the hype about these shows

I like these shoes a lot Comfortable and well made The Ultra Boost shoes are narrower than the Ultra Bounce shoes So be aware of this if you order online

after 2 washes sole starts feeling off the material is poor too

I was missing something I walk a lot at work and with UltaBoost I feel I can do more Love it

I would recommend but very expensive Trust me these shoes are the comfy shoes ive worn but you start to get use to them very quickly One downside is they get dirty very quickly

They last for ever they are well made and all around great shoes

These boosts run a little large but other than that are very comfortable and look nice

Have owned the Triple White 3 0s for almost a year now throw them in the wash and are good as new Slightly small as a 13 feels more like a 12 5 but other than that very solid shoe

These shoes are awesome I recently started running more often for my work outs and the shoes I had were pretty good so I thought My feet would hurt and my ankles would ache after sprints Switching to these shoes was like strapping marshmallows to my feet So if you like softer running shoes get these I will definitely be buying another pair in another color

I just received these in the mail today and put them on for a trip to the store This is my first pair of ultraboosts but they will not be my last I am now a believer Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and easily the best looking I will be recommending them to everyone I can

Love this colorway and the 3m reflection pops with the ultra boost

Great energy return Upper is good quality even with recycled materials Environmental consciousness is a big part of these shoes but still very reasonable running shoes

These are the sickest colorway of Ultraboosts Nuff said

Most comfortable and lightest shoe I have ever owned

They fit like a glove and feel like I am stepping on a temperpedic mattress

The sneaker is ok not great Tight fit and I wear one size up always still tight When you taking off the sneaker the bottom pad comes up

Style and fit awesome So comfortable I wear them for everything

Runs small definitely go a size up Otherwise the shoe is great Would recommend

very comfortable and good looking shoe the color way is very true to the picture

They are like walking on air I wear orthotics and they fit perfect and wear perfect in the shoe

5 200 lbs and I walk on pavement The soles are split Fortunately the knitted uppers are in good shape and are stylish However I purchased for performance Adi check your design again

this shoe is amazingly comfortable the boost and the primeknit work perfectly to make sure your foot is locked in a really nicely padded I have not gotten the 4 0s yet but I have the 2 0 3 0 and the uncaged and I loved wearing them more than any shoe

Looks like a very comfortable shoes and I would wear it because it looks like i could walk for miles

Awesome shoe wish it came with a few pies of colorful shoe laces to add some flair to them

A bit on the narrow side but really comfortable supportive shoes

Comfy with stability What else does one need to know

My wife purchased hers and convinced me to get a pair too Love it

I tried A whole size up and they still did not fit correctly I used to love the old fabric

He says they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned

The colors look good together The materials and the comfort of the shoe are terrific

A little snug but the cushion is hard to beat I recommend

Looking for light attractive multipurpose shoe for running touring and casual nights out to travel with small suitcase

I was always a Nike guy but these shoes changed me They are very comfortable and really minimize walking fatigue

If anyone can answer if the centimeter or two is okay in the front that would be amazing

I absolutely love this shoe It fits very comfortably and feels very nice to walk in Not to mention that they look very slick on your feet My only problem with the shoe is that the heel cup and cage came scuffed up out of the box which is very disappointing but I have not seen others with that problem so I think it was just a defect with my pair

Fit good I will buy another color ultra boost later

Very comfortable shoes and very nice I recommend this shoe

Wife says to me Those shoes better do the walking FOR you And with Boost it feels like they do Best sneakers I have ever worn and now the wife is getting a pair too

Absolutely amazing Walking on clouds Triple white FTW

Amazing amazing amazing and that is Alli have to say

Great look and feel but most comfortable shoe a pair of shoes that will make you not want to wear any other style ever

I have owned these shoes for six months and they have been great until I kicked a soccer ball once On the first hit I looked down and there was a tear in the prime knit I am very unsatisfied at the amount of money these shoes are with the quality of the product I received

its good all around shoe and great for working out in

The shoes are great for running It fits well and is very comfortable

They are stylish comfy and go with any clothes you wear

Very light and comfy easy to put the shoes on and no laces needed it seems But it is little tighter on the width even when i got 1 2 size larger

Like this shoe very much but it was very snug in my size even thought the length was correct Would recommend going half a size up for wider feet

Tried them out after hearing so many good things about them Feels like running with clouds under your feet Sooooo comfortable

I love the style the ride everythingexcept the fit which is ridiculous I normally wear a 10 5 I returned those for an 11 They felt OK at first but wearing over the course of a a few days I have determined that the upper is too tight and they are compressing my feet I have never worn an 11 5 but that probably would have been more appropriate Disappointed after paying a premium for these shoes My Epic Reacts fit so much better

Best colorway IMO but the one that sold me is the Boost technology I just hope they paint the boost white so its looks fresh all the time

Love how the soles feel Very comfortable great bounce Needs more variety in design and color

Bring on my feet all day for my job required quality protection for my feet which helps reduce the risk of low back pain

High quality Quality and Profession makes perfect I liked the material and design It actually felt different this time as it suits my feet and comfort my pain I recommend all my friends to buy it its worthy Thank you adidas

Cons Price run slightly narrow even with 1 2 up white midsole squicky traction tongue not separated

Literally feels like you are wearing socks Extremely comfortable

NB is a more comfortable but this is still a great shoe

Looks good plus it is really comfortable The PK is soft and durable Boost is life

These 4 0s were my first pair of Ultraboosts and they definitely live up to the hype Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned Boost is life

These shoes are ridiculously light and comfortable it is actu true to size but because I have wide feet it is a bit snugged on the toes Also perfect with thin socks I have another UB in 8 5 and they fit perfectly If you have wide feet go half size up But overall good quality and comfort

see more I like it more but it is not showen in different color and style

I like the comfort and feel Feels like I am running with well padded slippers I broke them in today for an 8 mile run and I love it If they were not so expensive I would get one in each color

it is the most comfortable shoe in my collection and they look good

Not sure have not worn them yet but if it is like all my other ultra boost I will love them

The store employees were fantastic and one of them recommended getting them half a size down these are my second pair after the 2 0s and sure enough the fit was perfect

Great shoe super comfy and helps the environment

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I recommend to anyone looking to save their feet from Nike shoes

Very comfortable and light I can stand and walk on these shoes for hours at work

Style and comfort hands down I will not settle for less

I like it and it is very comfy and looks great They are a lot cooler looking in person then online and really pop with a pair of black pants I strongly suggest these shoes

Its very light weight and comfortable to your feet love it so much

Ultra boost technology is amazing for comfort and style Adidas is the best brand there is hands down

it is so comfortable and stylish can not wait for another release of Ultraboost

Comfortable and great style Would recommend this shoe

These are VERY comfortable sneakers I just got them so I am still getting used to them I generally wear Ecco Biom sneakers and I must say they are the best I have ever worn but these Ultraboost sneakers are definitely up there in comfort and style They seem to get more comfortable the more I wear them I am an Uber Lyft driver and one day I picked up an Adidas rep and we started talking sneakers I am a sneaker maniac as I love to walk and probably put 2 to 6 miles a day in walking My rider going a pretty long way convinced me to give Adidas a shot and I am happy that I did He named the Ultraboost and I wrote the name down These are so cool looking that I do not even want to exercise walk in them but only wear them around And they are so comfortable that I wear them around the house like slippers I own about 15 pairs of sneakers hope this helps

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Most comfortable shoe on the market If your on your feet for a long period of time its a must have No need for the chiropractor anymore

So comfortable amazing already ordered another pair definitely recommend

Feels like I am walking on clouds I need another pair to back these up

Love it I would have alot more if it was almost 200 for a pair

My son loves ultra boost and I finally bought him some caged They fit his high instep very well

it is a very good product I recommend adidas then Nike

nice shoes i like this shoes but when you want buy lets order with large size then

the shoes are supportive and very comfortable nice

These are fantastic shoes Helpful to the environment well made and supremely comfy My one issue is that the opening to get your foot in is much tighter than my Ultraboosts 3 0 Not a deal breaker and a have giant feet so this is probably not a common complaint but I at first thought that my true size was going to be too small untill I forced my foot into the shoe It seems to be stretching a little bit cause it is easier to get my foot in now but that is my warning to all wide footed fellow out there

Durable comfortable well worth the money I will be buying another pair for sure

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Trace of glue around the boost cushion fits well comfortable to wear

I love the comfort of the ultra boost These shoes have the best soles and overall feel of any shoe I have had

love it but would try a bigger size shoes next time

Great sneakers Love the look and comfort This is my second pair i just love them

overall good purchase slightly narrow fit in front very comfortable

Easily the most comfortable shoes I own I have 4 pairs of Ultraboosts I have the 3 0 Burgundy 4 0 Ash Pearl 4 0 Triple White and now the 4 0 Cookies and Cream Easily the best colorway the black boost white cage and grey black white material looks amazing Looks great on foot

These shoes are crazy comfortable Never want to wear a different shoe again

Great shoe overall It was a little bigger than I expected But still a great product

Shoes are super comfortable And they are made so well

It is the most comfortable shoes I have ever tried on and great looking

These shoes are amazing The only negative I have to say is they are a little pricey but they are hands down one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I returned a pair of NMDs when I got these They have so much more support stability A completely superior shoe

Just look at this shoe how could you not love it

It is a nice soft and comfortable for diabetics too

Son loves them I lost one of his shoes somewhere in a Georgia hotel parking lot while traveling Spring break so This pair was to replace the one shoe I lost

Super comfortable easy to slip on and stylish

Love the color comfortable I would buy them again

I can not believe how comfortable these are and I love Adidas and once again they surprise me 10 10

The color way is so cool good purchase ultra boost never let me down

Make a wider fit version of the Ultraboost Although they fit well you should offer a wide fit option when selecting the shoe Other than that it is a great show and would highly recommend

I own several pairs of Ultraboosts and they are all fantastic but these are the best looking and as comfortable as ever

All in all the price tag may look a little steep but you are really getting 3 different shoes in one with these I picked them up in a great neutral grey and plan to pick up more colors in the future I am officially a convert to the three stripes

This has to be most comfortable shoe ever manufactured for men

They are the best shoes I have ever purchased My feet hurt for a days after I started wearing them I think it is because they are not used to that much support Once you break them in they are the most comfortable shoes ever It feels like your walking on a cloud it is also really fun to stand and move your weight from one side to the other and watch the cushioning squish

The shoes are the most comfortable I have ever had Will most likely buy a second pair for casual wear

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I received them as a gift and it was the BEST gift EVER They are awesome shoes Highly recommend I am a woman and got these shoes

Top lace hole wears and breaks easily within just one month of nominal use

I bought a new ultra boost shoes and Adidas sent a used one The tracks on the bottom had dirt embedded into it One side of a shoe was ripped You can also see that in the picture

Love them I had the sole professionally blacked by my custom on IG guyv a because I do not have the time to clean

This shoe has the spring and bounce of deer and the comfort of a bag of cotton balls It is a fast shoe with great traction It is like a running foot spa Perfect

My son loves this show very comfortable Was more than expected

Awesome shoes and the most comfortable I have ever wore

These shoes made running feel so easy The level of comfort they provide is unreal I have really flat feet and they add a level of comfort like I have never felt Working out with them is so comfortable you will not know unless you try them on Already looking to buy another pair

Most comfortable shoe I have ever had Definitely love the fit

These sneakers look identical to the picture online and they are a perfect fit with a great look Love them

Extremely comfortable great support and fit Excellent stability The only th8ng I would change is the color of the laces to match the accent color of the shoe

Another great color way Same great shoe I would recommend to anyone

It goes with any outfit and it is really light and it is just dope

it is a beautiful shoe True to size My husband is in love

So comfortable to run Good option for the runners

I love this shoe they are very comfortable and a good quality

I like the comfortable feeling when wearing them Plus they look pretty fly

Because I wear these or my other pair everyday Comfiest show out there

Extremely comfortable great fix and very stylist My go to sneaker for the gym and weekend

best brand and very nice design will recommend it for daily use and during work out times

Got the green grey with white heel cup color scheme They look incredible and being ultraboosts they are extremely comfortable Sexy sexy shoes

This color way is not as good as it looks in pictures Shoe feels amazing though I will post a picture of a good shoe

Comfortable Good Looking Matches many outfits Overall good quality and amazing everyday shoes Definitely worth the 180

Can get a full workout in now without losing circulation in my feet

Dope shoe Very good shoe to walk and sport around

Very comfortable and good looking My son likes these and will purchase more

Love your products but very disappointed I have had to send to pair of my favorite running shoes back due to faulty shoelace loops on the shoe They break making it impossible to lace them all the way up Two pair have been sent back

Very comfortable great for running though not such much for cross training

Great running shoe I love how the shoe is reflective when the lights hit them

Love love love these shoes I want one in every color

Very comfortable if you are on your feet for extended periods of time

Love the comfort Only problem i had at first was the cage felt alittle chocking at first but fixed up my laces and it allowed for a little more room around the sides

So comfortable and stylish Can wear with anything

Very comfy and comfortable I like width because of my bunion Though pricey

I have a sneaker collection dating back to 1988 with well over 150 Nike Adidas New Balance etc and Ultraboost are still by far the comfiest shoes I have ever worn Hats off to Adidas for implementing this amazing technology into such a clean silhouette Also not that it matters but Ultraboost are head turners when it comes to style You WILL get complements on these when rocked with a dope outfit trust

I like the shoes because they are super comfortable and advertised as said

Comfort cushioning style I have worn this shoe training running and for everyday wear

Awesome material They are 3M reflective which gives them an extra flair

Looks pretty good right now if it had a black boost it would look pretty sick

I would definitely recommend these shoes to everyone looking for comfortable shoes

I love these shoes they are extremely comfortable and stylish My only complaint is that the caged part gets marked a little too easily but its not too noticable but is a little annoying at times

Great running shoes as well as for travelling Very comfortable

great product smaller than previous version which made it uncomfortable to walk

Bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them I recommend this product

they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and I recommend them

Should buy will not regret the purchase of the price

I have had 2 other pairs of these but i can never stay away from them especially the new 4 0 model super breathable stretchy comfortable and overall amazing

High quality and very comfortable Minimal shipping time

They feel different than what I was expecting The comfort of the sole does not seem to match my desired comfort for the insole

I love the Ultra Boost line however the 4 0tend to run a little bigger than previous models

These feel supportive through long runs and are still great for tempo

Another quality Adidas product Appropriate shoe for 5k fitness runs I would recommend this shoe

These are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought I have a wide foot so its a bit tight but other than that they are awesome



I have a pair of ultra boots and liked them so much I just ordered another pair

I needed shoes and a friend recommended boost to me Honesty i am very satisfied

provides a good combination of support and comfort but the boost tends to get dirty rather quickly Overall good product and would totally recommend

it is really like a sock and comfortable a really good shoe to wear anything you want

The untraboost is light but also sturdy enough to feel stable in It does not matter what I am doing i feel locked in and ready to go in these shoes

These are great quite possibly the most comfortable shoe on the planet

They are so confortable The only flaw is the cage scratches so easily and looks bad

light very comfort and I never feel i wearing shoes

Comfortable fit all around Killer sole with a snug glove like feel with the uppers Love this shoe and color way

Comfortable and very light weight Also a very good looking shoe and I wear them practically every day

So comfortable highly recommend it I have bought theee pairs since my first

Small things but hey when you spend this much on some shoes you would nitpick

It runs a bit small so you might wanna make sure But great product and very comfortable

It is an amazing running shoe I also have the encaged version which are also nice

3rd pair these are everyday for sure Adidas

I am a nurse and on my feet all day No other shoe has been this comfortable Will never go back to any other brand

These shoes are real comfy and got that big style

Bought the shoe because of its comfort and high recommendation But do not feel it has enough style and option Pretty simple looking to me

Worth for the price spent and Best suitable for running on any kind of terrains

Very comfortable and perfect for gym workouts Also stylish to wear out

I bought the Ultra boost 3 0 17 days ago and the Continental tread as show abnormal wear considering I only walk in them just 22 miles so far

For his qjality and look and price And all the commodity and my boys like a lot Adidas

I ordered my first pair of ultraboost 4 0 a half size up which was a mistake Order true to size with this version and they will fit perfectly Everything else is perfect 10 10

I feel the way the sole of the shoe is designed can create some discomfort in long distance runs The sole is comprised of many small and circular pieces I find that some of them can put unnecessary pressure on the bottom of my foot causing pain over time

Besides the price product is the best shoe purchase I have made

It is super comfortable in the primeknit upper is really breathable great for all day wear and casual wear

Bought these shoes for my son he loves them there true to size very comfortable and would highly recommend

I needed the comfort because my feet do not have arches so most shoes hurt to wear for to long but because of the boost I have yet to find a problem with these shoes

Very comfortable at this price I would say it is hard to say something bad but they are almost a liability now on my feet haha

I like the shoe it looks nice and feels nice The sole looks mushy but feels firm I am 190 lbs 5 6 and my feet feel great after wearing them all day Kind of tight around the feet but sill feel ok NOT thick sock friendly would buy again in different color scheme

Shoe is awesome and would tell anybody to buy Love it

A friend bought one of this boots and it looks and durable

Not a driving shoes My achilles tendon hurts on multiple occasion when I drove for just for 3 hrs I have to accustomed to breaking in my own car due to very soft cushioning Boost So in the end these shoes will be my trunk while driving

unique love the color ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe ever

Not very comfortable My feet start to hurt after only one hour of wearing them

Really comfy shoe and super stylish it goes with everything

It is comfortable

Shoe is uncomfortable if worn more than an hour or standing for a long period

This is no doubt my favorite shoe I own multiple pairs of ultraboosts and each pair just make me feel like I am walking on clouds Adidas really nails this product in the head For running best shoes I have ever run in hands down And it does not hurt that they look dope Overall a great shoe

I love ultra boosts I always have two pairs in rotation One of the reasons I need two pairs is because of the mesh tearing unexpectedly This can be annoying but it is a small price to pay for the amount of comfort and possible use out of the shoe

Like walking on clouds and that is all I have to say about it

Boost 360 is the best in golf shoes and running shoes

One of the best shoes I have ever owned Fits perfectly

These are expensive but maybe the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Simply the best sneaker I had ever owned Will not buy any other brand Addidas Ultraboost ROCK

My son is always hard to shop for shoes and these are the first ones that have fit him right from the get go

This is easily the best pair of shoes I have ever purchased

Really comfortable on the basketball court and walking around too

Best purchase and excellent running shoes I recommend it 5 stars plus for those that run all the time and even if you only just walk

Great Color way Comfortable and stylish shoes Shoes are great with every day ware

great bounce it adds to your step width is a little snug for me

Super comfortable shoe I will recommend this shoes to everyone

Unbelievable quality incredible comfortability best sneaker ever

As I said this running shoe is certainly the best I have ever used My only problem is my different size feet One is a twelve the other a half size bigger Other than than this shoe is outstanding

Very comfortable very stylish a little narrow I have wide feet

Most comfortable shoes I own Definitely getting more

Shoes are comfortable and very well made and look great on

Love the 4 0 ultra boost It is definetely more confortable than the 3 0 The 4 0 run a little smaller than the 3 0 Get a half size larger if your feet are wider

Very late to the Boost scene but these are the most comfortable pair of shoes I own I wear them mainly for lifestyle Purchase was hassle free and shipping was fast Went true to size and they fit perfect as long as I do not wear thick socks Can remove the insole if I need more room Thanks Adidas

These are extremely comfy and feel like a sock Great for running and great for style

The size and comfort is a amazing Perfect shoe for working out or just casual wear

They are very comfortable and the cushioning is exceptional However they run small so order 1 2 size up The main gripe with adidas is that their shoes are inconsistent with their sizing across their different sneaker lines The sneaker itself is amazing once you can find the right size

Its very nice and comfortable Espicially for sport people

My bf really likes it He said it is very comfortable

the comfort is awesome especially when i run long distance the best running shoe i ever had

Perfect fit Remember to size up half a size Best shoes to wall around on

color is bright and works well with different styles

Love these beautiful shoe very comfortable need to double up

So good to walk in love them Worth the money Buy them

I like the way they look on but honestly they are not the most comfortable shoe I prefer the uncaged ultra boost for comfort

I love the comfort and fit of these Durable so far and looks great too Will defeitely recommend and will probably buy more ultra boost in the future

Most comfortable pair of shoes that I have ever purchased or worn

The sole feels like your feet are being cushioned by clouds

incredibly comfortable shoes of high quality and style

Great because making use of recyclables Unique shoe

These shoes are stylish and very comfortable to wearing for long periods of time

extremely comfortable shoe One of the best shoes I have purchased

The shoe is amazing I previously had Alpha Bounce shoes which were already great but these are one step further up Get 5 size bigger than what you regular wear they run a bit small

It is very comfy and the quality is wonderful When I put them on i felt like i was on clouds

 xe2 x9d xa4 xe2 x9d xa4 xe2 x9d xa4it very comfortable and stylish highly recommend

1 2 a size too small slightly narrow in width maybe get 1 2 larger than you are used to

Overrated and overpriced wish I did not purchase them

does not have the comfort as my current style ART BB3931

Definitely give these a chance I was not sure of finalizing on these and was almost skeptical of buying but once I did unbox them I have not not tried to wear them everywhere Super clean shoe and definitely recommend this colorway as a staple in anyonecollection

Love the look unfortunately can not Wear with seam digging into the top of my foot

The comfort and colors of these shoes are phenomenal

I love love love all my ultra boost This pair of black and white contrast is sick on the door I would recommend without question

This is my very first pair of Boost I must say that I am a instant fan of these shoes I have not use them for running yet but for everyday use they are so worth it I will definitely be buying more pairs of Boost Worth every penny They also fit true to size

Bought 2 of the same pair just in case Adidas never has a perfect sneaker like this again Best sneaker I ever owned

Did not like yellow logo so sharpied that out but love the shoe overall

I love ultra boosts Easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet and not to mention they look amazing Save up your money and buy these

I like this product because it fit my needs in a shoe

This shoes is the most comfortable shoe ever I love the style and the comfort

Fashionable and comfortable With all the available color ways I have always got an matching outfit

Love these shoes Super comfortable guaranteed to make you run faster and jump higher

Tried suggested size 10 1 2 which is a half size larger than my actual size It was still width wise to small Although uncomfortable the cushioning was remarkable

Awesome comfort and style Way better than others

Look great and feel even better Perfect for everyday use

Awesome colorway Love the way the primeknit is done on this model

Ordered half size up still comfortable and went tts still great either way

I really liked them but I have not bought Adidas in a long time I normally wear 11 but these were just a half size too big on me Great product though

I loved wearing these shoes for about 3 weeks until I noticed I had less and less support I checked the shoe and the prime knit upper began to separate from the midsole To add to the fact the insert inside of the shoe has started peeking away I loved these shoes until the quality issues appeared

Added this shoe to my collection and could not be happier Love the color way As always the Ultra Boost is the most comfortable shoe out there True fit a little on the narrow side but that suits me Will be adding more color ways as they drop You can not go wrong with this shoe

I can not believe these shoes are not sold out Not only does the 3M design just POP in the light but the overall feel and look are top notch do not sleep on these shoes I do recommend going half a size up especially if you have wide feet

Not sure if words can describe the utter comfort this shoe delivers Not only does the shoe deliver in comfort the multi colorway is visually stunning in hand My pair had the perfect amount of orange in them giving the shoes a subtle yet noticeable pop

Love the comfort True to size was too tight around top of the foot Gave me red marks that demonstrated that it was cutting off circulation Ordered 1 2 size up and it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

Had been eyeing some ultra boosts for awhile and finally pulled the trigger on these and I was not disappointed These are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and the bonus is they look amazing

I love the comfort of the Boost I go to the gym with these sneakers as well as go to work in them as well which is why Iove my job I can wear BOOST ALL DAY

its a nice and stylish shoe its also very comfortable

Good quality

I like the product simply because it already looks comfortable on the feet and makes one relax more and makes your feet nice and comfy especially to jog it helps with tough turns on the jogging trail which makes it a good and strong traning shoe

I can not find a complaint Everything checks out You cannot go wrong with a pair of Ultra Boost

Best shoes ever These are so comfortable I love that these are limited release as well

The best shoe i try so far i could sleep them on

The 4 0 ultraboost is the pinnacle of comedies and style My favorite of the boost I have gotten And an improvement on the 3 0 which I also loved

Extremely comfortable My favorite everyday shoes

I will be purchasing another pair soon

Better quality than the Nike flyknits he had that ripped in the first month

The best shoes on earth there is nothing that I can compare to these shoes Thank you adidas for mowing my days at the gym better by my feet never hurting Perfect shoe worth the money

The comfort of other shoes does not even compare to the Ultraboost Honestly the Ultraboost is hands down the best product I have ever bought

Very comfortable shoe and the black color is amazing

Amazing shoes comfort is insane per usual Awesome colorway on this one

Adidas continues to kill it This shoe is amazing

Comfort although quite expensive Worth your money and I recommend

I am buying up any and all boost products The cushioning system can not be messed with This is my third pair of Ultra Boosts and my 6th pair of shoes featuring boost

The most comfortable and best looking shoe I have ever purchased Oh yeah and the most expensive as well Thought it was going to come with some extras for that price

I like it because it is comfortable and amazing for running

Big fan of the ultra boost shoe love the fit and comfort

Loved the over look and comfort The stripes strikes again

Works well for outdoor and indoor distance running I logged in 30 miles since buying them and the comfort is on another level

I am a 200lb runner with flat feet I wear size 15 in most shoes but I can wear a 14 in these They look amazing They feel even better When you slip these shoes my first thought is wear have you been all my life I just purchased in a 5k with a time of 19 12 and recently did a Half Marathon with several different terrain The boost held up perfectly They come out of the box ready to go but once you break them in my goodness I have logged 7828 miles Running in these shoes make running even more exciting As a personal trainer I recommend these to all my clients They are the best

Yes it is comfortable and looks nice its not to expensive

What I did not likea bit expensive fits a bit snug so I sized up 5 and limited quantity

it is Lit These sneakers are some of the best from adidas in 2018 IMO

Like the product Just the white part on the sole looks kinda cheap but its comfortable

like them run a little small apart from that they are good

Great shoes very comfortable perfect fit feel like slippers

Quality shoe wish it was a little cheaper Around the 125 150 price would be better The comfort and quality backs up the steep price I walk 10 miles a day and use these for my work shoes and they work great

I purchased these for my son along with shoes for his two sons He said the shoes were awesome

These shoes are like wearing padded socks The primeknit material is stretchy and feels strong and the detail of alternating white lines is really cool especially in the sun These look awesome on my feet

I like the way it looks It feels really comfortable and is a good fit

perfect supper comfortable The best shoes i have ever bought

My son loves all his ultra boost He is 64 and weighs 240lbs Comfortable shoes are not always easy to find He loves them

This is just the most comfortable shoe ever made feels like walking on the clouds and when it is night time it is the bomb as I get a lot of nice compliments cos my shoe makes me stand out

I have three pair of the 4 0 and two pair of the 3 0 I have a normal size foot and both versions fit me true to size I noticed on the core black pair it suggests to order a half size up but I ordered my true size 11 like usual and they fit perfectly I will say that the primeknit on these 4 0 versions is not as stretchy as the 3 0 and because of that it is a more snug fit but these shoes are supposed to fit snug and a half size up would be too big for me I recommend you order your true size and if you want a less snug fit you can always remove the insole It makes very little difference in terms of cushion with or without the insole

I like the color and that they are very comfortable

I like the product because it looks really cool and it feels very good on the feet

Really versatile with the cookies cream color way

i love the product but i would want to know the color on the screen when you search up alter boost

I really Like the overall look and design of the Sneaker Paying homage to Oreo cookies and being released on national Oreo day was a cool idea The colorway is perfect and the cookie mixture of the prime knit shows there was a lot of attention to detail in releasing These The comfort of these UltraBoost is bar none as comfortable as ever so I definitely suggest getting these if comfort and style is on your list of things you are looking for in your next pair of kicks

My first pair of ultraboost and many more to come I have a a bunch of Ghazals in the past but these were well worth

Very comfortable shoes I am on my feet all day I walk itleast 7 miles a day at work and these shoes have been excellent

The shoe is the most comfortable I have had The colorway is also very distinct and I receive multiple compliments

These shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and they look amazing Everyone keeps asking me how I got them and I have to tell them that I stayed up until 2 A am for the release but it was well worth it The quality of the shoes are definitely top notch and this was easily the best shoe purchase I have ever made Well worth the money

Possibly one of the comfiest shoes i have ever owned

Super comfortable but had to buy a half size too small because of low selection at store

weightless crazy comfortable look great I work out in them and just out and about Also great for running on the beach

Best comfortable shoe ever highly recomend any boost shoe

I bought these shoes for my boyfriend because his gym shoes were looking really ragged He says they are really comfy and easy to walk in Good for at the gym but he would not use them outdoors on like turf or grass

Great look good length but narrow at the top Removing the insole helps or wearing it barefoot but is a problem with thicker socks

Very comfy shoe and stylish Just sucks trying to compete with bots just to get a pair

It is very comfortable but the size is misleading its hard to purchase shoes online and it was frustrating to not be able to see them in the store I returned them

The ultraBOOST is one of the comfiest shoes you can find while expensive they make up for in it cloud like comfort and great styling and colorways

This are the most amazing shoe Gonna be hard to beat going forward Only regret is I can barely wear them because there to hard to come by in cookies and cream

Ultra boost sets the bar for comfort and of course for style too

Ultra boost without the insoles are the most comfortable lifestyle shoes to date

Love the pattern on the Cookie Cream colorway It definitely pops

Comfortable and stylish I very much dig Boost technology

Perfect style way comfortable and can enjoy them all day

Absolute best shoes I have ever owned Only shoes I will be wearing for a while

Use to wear different brand of shoes so took some time get use to them But once my feet got acclimated to them the shoes feel great and fit perfectly

Primeknit upper is soft and pliable as you would expect and in this colorway with the dark grey painted boost foam and spotted upper hides dirt well

Not only is it extremely comfortable it is very aesthetically pleasing Definitely would recommend buying

Great shoe really comfortable looks dope and I have got lots of compliments on them

Most comfortable shoe I wore definitely worth it to buy

The 4 0 UltraBoost are a little snug in the toe box if you go your tts for UBs but they do loosen up after a days wear I stayed with my 3 0 sizing and it worked fine for me The 4 0 colorways are a little bland but there are some like the cookies and cream that just pop If you have not tried Ultraboost for whatever reason get over it and put on a pair

Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Unmatched comfort the most comfortable shoe on the market hands down

The foot support throughout the whole shoe is insane Just bought a pair of yeezy 700 boosts too and they are comfortable but not as comfortable as these UB

The shoes look better in person and are very comfortable

I like the ultra boost the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

I almost did not buy this pair Glad I did just prefer the grey and black look

And keep in mind I use this shoe as a lifestyle And not really a runner

Overall it is a great shoe Good response to running and working out Very comfortable and I am happy they went with continental for the sole

Love Ultras as always just wish Adidas stopped releaseing so many and make it more limited like before

The most comfortable shoe out in the market and the aesthetics are show stopping

Awesome addition to my UB collection Like the color and the story behind it

Looks nice and very comfortable Need to add more pairs Easily sold out

Second pair of uktra boost purchased and I love them A great shoe

Color way is dope ComfortWell you should know by now boost is life

Love the color way comfortable as expected glad I was able to get a pair since it sold out fast Love it

Comfortable Cool looking Great color Very light

Perfect everyday use shoe Really comfortable for running

Not a huge bike fan anymore NMDs come close but I still think this is possibly the greatest shoe ever made The colorway helped sway me into my purchase as well

I have bought two pairs of Ultra Boost Probably buy more

it is an Ultraboost Will always be super comfortable

Very comfortable shoe with great arch support Fits like a glove

Great shoe great colorway Like walking on a cloud

I purchased this shoe to wear all day long as a lifestyle type shoe The shoe has a nice clean look and the boost midsole is fantastic I have a high volume foot and the mid foot felt a bit tight at first but with some lacing adjustment all is great I highly recommend this shoe

I love the Ultra Boost 4 0 they are super comfortable and the quality of the material is superb If I could afford all of them I would buy them all

This is my 3rd pair of UBs so I am familiar with the comfort and fit and feel This pair however has a really eye popping color scheme with the black boost material and oreo primeknit

I was fortunate the be able to get the Oreo 4 0 and I am very happy The color schematics goes really well Of course the comfort of the Ultra Boost is ever reliable and consistent Not much to say I am just happy to be very lucky to get these specific shoes Thank you Adidas

You can really never go wrong with the UltraBoost This colorway really pops and goes well with workout running clothes or just black jeans My dad loves the ultraboost for running he already has the 3 0 oreos and so I bought him a pair of these as well These are one of my favorite colorways of the 4 0s yet

Size is a little off but love the look of the shoe

Got them as a present for my boyfriends birthday and he loves them He wears them all the time and tells me they are the most comfortable shoes he has worn

This is my 6th pair of Ultra Boost Love the design and comfort

Hard to find a performance shoe to fit my abnormal feet profile but from the first time I put these on it felt like they were produced just for me I would recommend these to anyone and say they run very true to size Excited to put them on every time I look at them

I love these shoes They are stylish and super comfortable

Comfortable and lightweight Great colorway and very clean

As great as always Adidas can not be touched best shoes best company

I like the ultra boost because of its comfort and looks The shoe is the most comfortable I have worn The only problem I notice is the ventilation

Super commfortable as usual Great look great style

The shoes not only look great they are equally as comfortable

Besides some glue stains on several areas shoes looks and feels amazing Great lifestyle and running shoes

I love the style and comfort of the shoes Cookies and Cream is my THING

I am a fan of the Ultra Boost series I have no complaints of the shoe

Best shoe purchase ever Comfortable shoe that fits well True to size

Comfort and quality best shoe would recommend

The translation from comfort to quality is seamless it goes from browsing the shops to tread milling Hop squats and back to a stroll without a hiccup personally this shoe should be prescribed to me to treat my plantar fasciitis these shoes level the playing field They are in the same catagory as sos toothpaste wateru2026 they are a Necessity

I like it cause they comfortable but I got them half a size smaller but they stretch so that is the good part of it

Extreme comfort and the look is perfect Favorite shoe I own at the moment

They do live up to the hype Very comfortable and head turners for sure

Most comfortable shoe from adidas Leading the industry in comfort and innovation

They are very comfortable and stylish You forget you that you have sneakers on

Looked great but glue marks around the cage were very noticeable on the primeknit

Super comfortable and look great I was able to get the cookies and cream release

Sizing with adidas can be hit and miss I bought 8 5 and they were a little bit tight around the mid sole I was lucky enough to purchase the Ultra Boost Cookies Cream on the day they released I absolutely love the charcoal Boost I have only worn them once at the gym and I am looking forward to breaking them in a bit more

Most comfortable sneaker out there today With the 4 0 pattern it is a most buy

Best shoes ever would buy them again Softest shoe on the market

So usually after I am on my feet for a long time they start to hurt I recently bought these shoes and happen to be on my feet all day I was just waiting for my feet to start hurting just like every other shoe I have owned Never happened A bit pricey but my comfort and feet are worth it Thinking of buying another pair in a different color Highly recommend these shoes

Perfect shoe for everyday use It is very comfortable and durable

it is a pretty good shoe but fits a little narrow and half a size small but overall it is very comfortable

Love the prime knit and love the boost material Very happy with the purchase

The colorway is amazing and is of course the most comfortable shoes in the market

I was always an originals fan going for a more classic look with sneakers After trying Ultra Boosts on I find it hard to wear anything else Pricey but well worth it Amazingly comfortable

I have been wearing Adidas Sambas for over 7 years I just never imagined that there was a shoe that could replace it Until I discovered Ultraboost Wow I liked it so much I got another pair Cookies and Cream

it looks good and I see the quality is on point as desired

These shoes are comfortable stable lightweight and fit like a sock They are worth every penny I do not think I would ever regret buying another pair of ultra boost

There is no words to describe this UBoost except PERFECTA

I have had over a dozen knee subluxations where knee pops out of socket and goes back in and throughout the years my knees are for sure more susceptible to pain I can truly say that the boost in these new 4 0seriously d and en the pressure on my knees from walking and running My family does not wear shoes in the house but now I do because they are literally more comfortable and less pain to walk in than without I also use orthotics but that is also to help me knees

I bought these shoes for my husband and he loves them He cannot take them off of his feet He says it is like walking on clouds they are that comfortable Also he loves that they are not too tight

I bought the legend ink colorway and it looks absolutely amazing I am not sure why a lot of people are saying to go half a size up or down Personally I got my true to size in UB which is an 11 and it fits me perfectly Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable pair of shoes

Comfortable light and they fit like a glove

These shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

This is my first pairs of ultraboost and I love it

Love the way the product looks and feels once on but they are not the easiest to slip on or off because there is no tongue

the fit is perfect they have a great bounce to them that make them really comfortable to wear over long periods of time

I bought the shoe to be on hard floors in the operating room 12 hours a day where I walk 3 5 4 miles a day The shoes are great for 8 10 hour days but not enough support for 12 plus Besides that it is a great shoe Bought my first pair of adidas in 1970 to play basketball in Nice comeback for the company

I had to buy a size larger Shoes are supper comfortable and stretch with you feet Great support

Very comfy and they look nice too Definitely would recommend

This shoe is very comfortable Looks great And is a nice Shoe

can not go wrong with this shoe best ultraboost so far

High quality very comfortable not accessible to all feet unfortunately

Honest opinion the way this show fits is not to big or bulky it is a clean solid look which is what I really like most about the shoe I got the core blacks and they are a perfect black shoe I was looking for The shoelace to the knitting is perfect and pretty soon I am going to buy another pair of all whites

I love it It feels super comfortable and I can wear this all day long without feeling tired on my feet

Sooooo comfortable this sneaker is the best for your money when it comes to comfort

Greatest shoe ever adidas for life Will be buying another pair as soon as possible

Good product overall arrived within 3 days fits welk comfortable but concerned about waterproofing

The Ultraboost is incredibly comfortable light weight and has superior support Seems to run a bit small so I suggest upsizing one size for a normal male foot Maybe a half size for a narrow foot Great quality shoe I will buy more in different colors

This is my first Ultraboost amazing I used it whole day at work gives me an incredible comfort The best highly recommend

Extremely comfortable and stylish Perfect for everyday use and training

My son loves these shoes they are very comfortable

Best of both worlds comfort for running and fashionable for casual wear

Comfort level is very high on UB The colorway is a plus

Style and looks great for working out or running The colorway goes with types of attire

the design and quality on this shoe is nice and clean

I have dealt with foot pain all my life due to a genetic disability I was never able to find a shoe I could walk in without issue I got a recommendation from a friend to try UltraBoost and it has been a miracle shoe No more foot pain Not to mention how stylish they are Thank you so much Adidas

You must try on a pair to know how comfortable these are Money well spent Try a pair and see for yourself

These shoes are definitely expensive but as someone who has to walk around very often it was a very good investment to make They are extremely comfy and the 3M technology makes the shoes look very stylish as well They take everything great about UltraBoost and just improves on the look

Unfortunately compared to the last pair of UltraBoost I purchased last year these are too tight Tried to wear half a dozen times but they do not fit

I recently had a foot injury where my ankle and foot swells and I have a hard time finding shoes that will fit without being too loose or too restricted These shoes are so great for that because they are so customizable with how tight or loose you need them to be I can have one shoe looser for the injured foot and the other normal for the normal foot One thing I will say is that they are a little big in length However it really does not bother me They are light breathable flexible and the soles are like walking on clouds I highly recommend these shoes

I love the design and color scheme It is also very comfortable and light weight

Honestly one of the best pair of shoes that I have purchased and I purchase a lot

These ran 1 2 size smaller than the 3 0 I would advise sizing up But they are so beautiful especially when the lights hits it

Another pair of ultra boost Comfortable as always and this one just looks good so I had to get them Glad I did

Ever since buying a pair of Ultraboost 3 0 I have not worn any other shoes besides dress shoes I am glad to welcome the LTDas my second pair of shoes that has Boost technology

One of the best shoes that adidas make the ultraboost are for daily walk

I have many Adidias boost shoes nmd primeknits etc these by far are the most comfortable and supportive can not wait for new colorways to purchase

I have tried this for a week and I when I go back to my old shoes and now I can not go back

I have this shoes in black and I have tried using this shoes for box jumps and I can feel the pain on my forefoot and knees when landing I do not get the cushioning hyper or shock absorption technology benefits and it actually feels much worst than most of my other running shoes I probably would not recommend this as an official running shoes to my friends as a casual walking shoesyesbut not as a running shoes

Very comfortable shoes and look great Buy it do not think about it Definitely the most expensive sneaker I have purchased but the comfort makes it worth it to me

I love this shoe on how simple is looks to how much little detail there is when you really get to looking at it You just can not go wrong with this pair of shoes Highly recommend them to anyone

Most amazing tribute to the original Boost shoe The 3m throughout the shoe is amazing The prime knit as always is top notch A Adidas I am picking up a second pair before my review sells them out

Love the product great feeling and great fit and all the color opinions One request is can yall please make a color opinion limited edition or something that is carolina blue and black that has design of dark mocha but just replace the mocha color with carolina blue

Perfect fit feels light as a feather and incredibly flexible while maintaining support Whether I am putting in laps at the park or the grocery store Ultraboosts will be my go to kicks

So comfortable and quality really good Good design shape

Not sure why I waited so long to get these shoes The most comfortable shoe I own

it is great you will not be disappointed it is amazing how the boost line pushes back with each step I will be getting more I wish I could give all my friends and family the gift of boost

Best 4 0 Yet The woven in 3m is toooooo sick A must pick up for the BOOST Fan

Love the product It is the most comfortable shoe I own it is top quality and materials and a great fit so far for the first week

These shoes look great and I have gotten plenty of compliments on them I could still wear them all day just like other ultraboosts My only issues I think the 3m causes the knit to not stretch as much so it would probably be smart to go a half size up Also of all shoes to have either a grey or black midboost these would have been it I hope there will be more non white midboost shoes released

I liked it because the shoes design was very unique I likethat it was not completely black and I love how they light up I would say size down maybe a half size but no more You will really like this shoe

comfortable shoes good for running and nice looking shoes

Good shoes not a big fan of design on 4 but 3m is really nice

The comfort of the shoe is as expected It is very nice looking and feels great to walk in

Perfect shoe I can not wait until more come out Love the boost technology

The ultraboost is the most comfortable sneaker ive owned I have multiple pairs and will continue purchasing them Only gripe i have is the previous boost models where more stylish Boost 1 0 2 0 had a better balance of color and aesthetics Hopefully adidas will retro them

Very comfy and durable great shoe for everyday use

You can never go wrong with the ultra boost

I love the product being a consumer of boost has changed my motif on adidas But now what only comes to mind for any future products is what is next

very comfortable great for working out will buy again

By far one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned Currently have 3 0 triple whites and 4 0 core black Love the product definitely recommend

Very happy with my purchase the 3M reflectiveness really pops

Comfortable looks good I am using these for running

Shoes are really comfortable and fit me well Love 3m too

Love every incarnation of white ultraboosts except the third Glad to see this one incorporate 1 0 elements

This product is amazing The 3m material is so unique and beautiful when it shines The subtle black when it does not on top of the great stripes Only other coloway that I think can compete is the new grey mints

Wanted to try some ultraboosts for a while tried on the 3 0 in store and fell in love with how light they are and how you can feel the squish from the boost sole

Great shoe Attention to detail Make sure you protect I can see these getting dirty quick due to being all white Great addition to Collection

I can not believe these shoes are not sold out yet

The look of the shoe is greatam an aggressive power walker up mountains and the support is great for both uphill and downhill stretches

The boost is incredible and the knit upper is second to none

The ultraboost 4 0 is a set up from the 3 0 Boost feel is the same as the 3 0 but the primeknit molds to your foot better which adds to the shoecomfort Go TTS as the fit is perfect on this model This version has 3M stitched within the primeknit so it will reflect when it is hit by light

My complaint is with your website the online photos were poor could not plainly see the item colors or weave Thought we were ordering a completely BLACK shoe received Grey exactly like last pair ordered Disappointed

My second pair Most comfortable shoe I own and I am a tenny shoe fanatic

The title says it all This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

In two words Love Them Highly reccomend for running and casual wear

If you have not taken a look at the pair you are missing out

These are the most comfortable shoes ever I am a nurse and they are perfect for 12 hrs shifts I would recommend these to anyone who is on their feet all day Keep it lit

This is another great ultra boost and the 3m makes this one really stand out I am glad I made this purchase

I love ultraboost They are the best shoes ever and most comfortable shoes ever

I originally started my ultra boost collection with the EQT 93 17 These are slimmer but still comfortable and feel more fitted than the EQT Which at times can be a little wide I have a wide foot so these fit true to size even though I wear a 12 in converse and a 14 in the EQT and these Ultraboosts

The boost was not as soft as parley ultraboost Probably needs to wear more to make the ultraboost soft

Good for everyday use I got all white so I am a bit scared to get them dirty but oh well

I walk about 3 miles a day due to my job and these shoes by far are the most comfortable to walk in I highly recommend these shoes to everyone

Easy to wear very versatile Perfect shoe for walking to the store and walking around in all day

Looks amazing but overpriced The 3M and yellow accents are a nice touch

Fits better than my darker colored boost and more comfy than my 3 0 Might need an extra pair

Great shoe Comfortable and a sleek look Everyone should try them

Needed a shoe for walking the dog So comfy but everybody knows that already Best shoes ever invented please do not change

The quality is amazing and the comfort is there for a sneaker at its price point its worh every penny

I went with a 9 5 in the 3 0 ultra boost They would not fit me whatsoever Now with the 4 0 it fits perfect for people with wider feet

These fit like pair of socks and just as light The way they form around my feet is quite comfortable Being 54 comfort is welcome especially with the accompanying style of the shoes

best pair of running shoes I have ever had and also couple as a great casual sneaker price is steep but i have two pair now and love them still more than ever def worth the price

More or less a impulse buy no regrets looks spectacular

The most comfortable shoe i have ever worn i would recommend this to a friend

It is the most comfortable Adidas shoe no scratch that The MOST comfortable shoes I own in general I have worn it for the like four days straight

Take the inserts out and they are my favorite shoe to walk or stand in have not ran hard in these yet but on a light run these are legit Noticed a lot less pain in the back and knees while wearing these for long periods on my feet Thanks adidas

I love this colorway especially the 3M hits and the two toned cage but I do not understand why they are priced at 40 more than a standard pair and 20 more than other LTD colorways For the price I at least expected extra laces or a fancy box Other than the inflated price I love the colorway The 3M hits are crazy reflective in certain light

These are off da HOOK Very cool stylish comfortable light weight and goes with everything The entire Ultra Boost shoe line are all so stylish that you can wear them anywhere dressed up or anywhere in between

They are comfortable shoes with a sweet style In addition to the comfortability they have the reflective speckles Sweet shoe

Love the colored heel cup Def my favorite colorway in the 4 0

I love these shoes Actually feels like you are getting boosted forward with every step More comfortable than the nmds for sure Although these babies are expensive they are worth every penny Would recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable stylish and durable shoe

Like all my UB these are by far the most comfortable sneaker on the market I workout in my UB However due to my step  and arch I cannot run long distances in them These are a great fashion statement and gym shoe Highly recommended

I received what I paid for a beautifully made pair to Adidas keep up the great work My closet now has equal Adidas to Jordanthat speaks for them self

So as far I am concerned the 4 0 is another excellent edition to the ultra boost family And as with every shoe there are pros and cons it is got a great fit good styling very lightweight and comfortable But will the thinner prime knit hold upFinding the right size can very by foot type and not as comfortable as last edition So far I have really enjoyed my 4 0 and have made it my most worn shoe The slight difference in comfort from my 3 0 is a worthy trade of for the better fit and lighter weight of my 4 0 To each their own

I like the color the style but most of all the comfort

You can not go wrong with an ultra boost They are very comfortable and stylish I would recommend them to anyone I know

Most comfortable shoes I own Every generation of the boost series have seen big improvements

Love the shoe the covert style really makes it a bit of sleeper shoe that becomes so much more once light shines on it with the 3M built in A must have for your stable

love the comfort love the fit true to size and love the aesthetics

I love the material and the overall comfort with the shoe it is a great shoe

The Boost cushion gives my foot the most comfort I have ever experienced in a shoe before The Continental tire rubber sole is extremely responsive I can feel the grip every time I walk I look forward to using them for a 15k i have coming up in March

Awesome purchase great shoe and colors This was a great shoe indeed

The shoe runs too small and narrow I buy size 9 5 in most brands this shoe was too small and narrow Had to return it

They are comfortable but they have got muddy and dirty even though I have cleaned them multiple times

I love it it fits so great I wore it everywehere

Excellent colorway of the Ultraboost 4 0 They look darker in person as in the pic the cage looks white in hand The cage is actually a very light grey Lots of Black peppered throughout the toe box All in all they look excellent on foot

I love these shoes the 3m is so reflective and looks so dope when in the right lighting and you can never beat the comfort of an ultra boost These shoes are a MUST BUY for any SNEAKERHEAD

I love the addidas ultra boost line this shoe is super comfarble and a great looking shoe

First pair of Adidas runners I would buy several more Ultra boost if they had more better colors Great shoe I have never met anyone that owns them that feels any different

I am standing all day at work so I needed some very comfortable shoes Ultraboost are very light and comfortable After a long 9 or 10 hour shift my foot does not hurt like with other shoes

I have owned two pair of the Adidas Boost The first pair broke down withing 6 months where there was a slit from side to side on the ball of the sole a good 1 2 deep I sent those back and got my money returned I bought another pair and they started breaking down one month in By six months I threw them away because the slit was so bad I have never had this happen on a pair of shoes before They are super comfortable so if the sole could be redesigned I would try them again

I ultimately choose to return these shoes because I found them too warm I live in Southern California and it is only February but it felt like I had snug fitting sweaters on my feet

Very Stylish and clean looking shoe Ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe I ever owned

Ultra boost are the best shoes ever Like walking on clouds

Thank you adidas for sending me free shoes and gear if you would like to send me more free shoes and clothes to review get back at me

Cool enough to wear casually and functional enough to wear to the gym

Very Comfortable and good quality I have plantar fasciitis and this shoes helps a lot

Too expensive for a pair of ultra boost that has no major difference from the other colorway Besides this colorway is not that crazy of a looking for it to be cost 40 more So NO I will NOT recommend buying this 3M stuff sneakers just for the 5th anniversary hype

Love the new primeknit they have and the new pattern is great for breath ability

very comfortable and looks great size is accurate too

Shoes run small I am a 12 should have gotten 12 5 I would suggest go a size above

So comfortable and really great shoes to wear daily

My second pair They feel great even a year later They never lose their comfort

I wore them to work for a 9 hr shift the first day I got them I would not recommend that as they did take at least 2 days to break in You can feel the boost as soon as you put them on I walk on tile a lot at work and notice they do squeak quite a bit Overall I like them and would get different colors This was my first ultraboost purchase

A

Comfort support and quality is superior to anything else

This is my second pair of ultra boost I have a high instep and they are the most comfortable shoes

ConclusionIf you are buying this shoe as a day to day shoe I would 10 10 recommend it will give you the best walking strolling experience you can get from any shoe in my opinion Also they look awesome on your feet while doing all the great things a shoe needs to do But if you are looking for a good running shoe I would try these out before buying them for that reason because you may be disappointed

Expensive but worth every penny The blue carbon colorway is exactly what I was waiting for

We had the product less than 2 weeks and already my sons shoes are falling apart sole is seperating from shoe

The LTD Ultraboost is the best ultraboost ever made

My son thinks this shoes pull his roommates all like that too

These shoes are some of the best overall shoes I have ever had I use one pair at the gym I attend the Air Force Academy so much of our time is spent working out because they offer a perfect balance of strength and rigidity for lifting as well as great comfort and support for running and cross training I bought a second pair to just wear around because of how much I love the shoes and how great they look with our PT uniform if I am just walking around indoors

it is a great shoe A little pricey but it makes up for it When you first put on an ultreaboost it is like walking on clouds it is very nice The only thing I noticed is and maybe this goes away after a few times of wearing them but after hours of them on my feet the tightness of the shoe was making my feet ache a bit But other then that it is an amazing shoe and I would definitely recommend it

The ultraboost is amazing It is meant for a running shoe but we all know it is more of a lifestyle shoe Not only does it look good it is the most comfortable shoe out The boost reacts and responds well

The shoes has good cushioning Being a wide footed person it wraps around my feet perfectly

My son loves these shoes He says they are comfy

Comfortable reliable and best for the money vshhdsh heyday hsbshhs handhelds shbxbvy

The quality was excellent as always but the shoe size was way to small The shoe was sent back on 2 5 2018

The shoe is very lightweight and comfortable I always feel like I am walking on clouds Perfect

This is a great shoe and I thought I got the wrong size the first time since my heel kept slipping Tried on the smaller size different color at a store fit perfect So I exchanged it for the color I did want but my heel is still slipping It seems this model is a little different than the other Ultra Boost listing that does not talk about having wool in the fibers Not sure why this one fits different in the heel maybe it is just me but hopefully I can find a color in the other style that I like because the shoes feel great just do not want to worry about my heel moving

I read every single review before purchasing these shoes They really are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had Thank you Adidas

3nd ultraboost shoes I bought it is a bit tight in width but leave a small space on my toes Overall they are fine

Bought this for my son for Christmas He said it is the most comfortable shoes in his collection HE is very happy with it Best part my sons surprised me with my own pair on my birthday And gotta say now my favorite pair as well Well done Adidas

It is a very comfortable shoe I will recommend this shoes to a friend or family

Super comfortable great design Love Boost will buy again

it is supppperr comfortable and effortless when walking

Stylish and comfortable super easy to wear with anything

Very comfortable good looking shoes Noticeable boost in energy of your step when walking or running

These seem to fit a little tighter than the 3 0 but maybe they just need to be broken in Love the ultra boost Best shoe I have

4 0 is already the best UB Now add the throwback colorway for the EnergyBoostCopped

I am so glad Adidas did major improvements on the Ultra Boost I have the original black and purple Ultra Boost and loved them Versions two and three were painfully tight in the forefoot and toe box Version 4 Ultra Boost is much better and takes the fit of the original and steps it up in a positive way For me personally there is significant more toe box and forefoot room There is added boost on this model which gives an incredible return which helps me run for longer periods of time I just wish the Ultra Boost LTD was not so expensive Overall great runner

Had to get this for the Anniversary pack EXPENSIVE

This is my very first pair of Boost shoes They have only arrived today so I can not say much about them other than the fact that they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Extremely good looking also

that is good shoes

Ultra Boost are simply thatthe most comfortable shoe ever Whether for just everyday use or for running you will not go wrong with a pair of Ultra Boost

I was a little hesitant towards the price but after getting them and being able to wear them Best shoes I have ever had

Once you won a pair of ultra boost you will not want to wear anything else

Comfort unreal definitely slept on during release Glad i copped and sick colorway Swapped the neon laces for black for a more lowkey flex

they are super comfortable and fit my style i recommend them

Shoes do not fit like other adidas I have and they look stupid and gaudy on my feet

Excellent product it is really comfortable and a very good design I only wait to get the Yeezy beluga to complete my collection

This is the best looking running shoe I have ever owned I have received at least one compliment every day I wear them

The shoe is pretty comfortable but the 3 0s are more comfortable The upper could be a little thicker I am my opinion too But still an all around good shoe

I work as a nurse aide right now and walk an easy 4 to 5 miles every shift I used to wear NMDs and they did not provide enough support and would come home with extremely sore legs and feet Now with ultra boost I have no pain

Tradition all the way back to my high school days in the 60 

Fantastic shoes Most Comfortable pair I have ever bought

I love this shoes are so comfortable and looks really cool

Not the best looking shoes The white version also got dirty very quickly

Finally got my hands on the hypest color way of the ultra boost Ultra boosts are legitimately some of the best and most comfy shoes on the market and in my opinion cannot be beat Best shoes in terms of comfort and appeal I can not recommend these shoes enough

Amazing shoe that I highly recommend The size ran a tad small on my pair but not enough to exchange it Maybe go up half a size to be safe

I got these shoes and loved them They are great for running and doing all the active stuff you do but i have had the for only two months and they have already started to rip Just wish these shoes were more durable

If adidas made a wide ultraboost that would be perfect Feels like walking on clouds but the plastic cage hurts the sides of my foot because I am a bit wider than normal

Great heel support and comfortable fit A very nice running shoe If you normally wear a 10 order a 10 5 US I would buy another pair

The shoes are very comfortable I would buy again

Very comfortable I would reccomend to others I would definitely buy another pair in a different color

Amazing pair of shoes only problem would be it is hard to clean if you get the tripple whites other than that amazing comfort and quality

GOOD QUALITY SHOE PLEASE START MORE MANUFACTURING IN THE USA

Title says it all I recently purchased 2 pairs of Nike Roshe Flyknit 2and returned them both it is tough to see myself going back to anything other than these now

These shoes look and feel great Perfect for anyone

I love the look and the feel of the shoe it is the most comfortable shoe I have

There super comfortable and very worm for winter the rubber on bottom holds up very well

Overpriced for the quality Spend my entire birthday money and not satisfied

Sweet shoes Get compliments everyday Super comfortable

Product is perfect for casual use Not so much for actual running

I am a crazy fan of this shoe I started getting into shoes last year and since then I have only worn boost I have had 3 pairs of shoes in the past year and the best is by far the UltraBOOST What can I say about this shoe it is so insanely comfy The huge boost midsole combined with the Primeknit upper makes such a comfy fit This and the super padded ankle area AND molded heel counter makes it feel like you are walking on a cloud

Huge fan of ultraboosts and these ones look even better in person

They are comfortable and they fit really good around your foot

This is my 5th pair of UltraBoost but my first pair of 4 0and they do not disappoint I personally think that the PrimeKnit on the 3 0is just a little bit more comfortable stretchier but this is still very comfortable and I love the look I have received lots of compliments on them already

Let then stretch a little and they will break in nicely

Extremely comfortable running shoes These shoes are highly recommended for long runs

I love these shoes it is a great lifestyle training lifting and running shoe all in one

Beauty for 2018 is the last word of beauty and wonder other other

the last word of that beauty for 2018 other

Very comfortable and really good quality Definitely the best shoes I have gotten in a while

I have always liked the ultra boost line from adidas When I saw these on shelves I was surprised because these are a really nice pair of shoes They are really comfortable also They also go with most things Style wise

My boyfriend recommended this shoe to me and i bought it thinking he was joking about how comfortable they were but when i first put them on i was very surprised you feel like you are wearing a sock and walking on air no joke

They fit my feet very well I like the color too

I love these shoes because they fit perfectly they are so comfortable and that is exactly what I was looking for

The shoe fuzzed after the third time I wore it but other than that a good shoe

The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a new running shoe or just a casual day to day shoe

I own 4 pairs greatest running shoe I ever had It is comfortable especially in the heel cup area Also love the colors to natch my workout shirt and shorts

Ultraboost 4 0 has a clean look new pattern and most of all comfort If you have never tried adidas boost you are crazy

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I really enjoy wearing these because they look and feel absolutely amazing I believe that everyone in the world deserves a pair The support and comfort of the boost helps cushion your feet The shoes are honestly the best money I have ever spent in a while

At first the boost was a little stiff but after couple of wears it became really soft and comfy Also the heel cage was really tight on my heel I manually stretched it out and now it is perfect I have wide feet so I have the laces loosened all the way now they feel like socks

They seem to run a little narrow but by far one of the most comfortable shoes I have owned

i like it because it is very comfortable and a good lifestyle shoe

Great styling extremely versatile Superior comfort

It looks amazing It is also extremely comfortable to wear on a daily basis

Along with being the most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased I would recommend to anyone who is an avid runner

The boost is amazing and it is so comfortable 10 10

Finally convinced myself to buy a pair of ultraboost despite being a good bit pricier than other running shoes out there My only regret is not buying these sooner Boost cushioning is far and away the most comfortable most responsive and most beneficial design on the market The Continental tread truly provides superior traction even in wet conditions The PrimeKnit upper is flexible enough for comfort but rigid enough for durability On top of all that they look incredible Worth every penny

Thing broke in one day terrible

I have been a huge fan of the Ultra Boost since 1 0 Althought I desperately need a new pair I cannot bring myself to purchase again based on the color themes with the 4 0 Where is the colorWhere is the excitementBRING BACK SOME COLOR

4 0 Primeknit pattern best ever Gray Color Great A tiny 1 4 size small maybe but not a big deal

The Parley Ultraboost is my first ever Ultraboost purchase and I am very happy with the comfort and quality of the shoe They do fit tight but I had to order a 12 5 cause they do not make 13 GR I took the sole out and have 0 complaints 1 of the best shoes I have ever bought I will be back for more

Great shoe and I would recommend it to anyone And if it is in stock you should get it right away bc thengo fast

Very stylish runner that matches its comfort The white blends in with any outfit making it easy to match

I love this product So easy to wear and match with and super comfortable and can wear them all day

it is too expensive Not affordable The quality is not that different

Its get heavier after a few miles of your running

Adidas All day everyday If you want a shoe that you all love these are them

True to size and colorway looks great Will recommend this product to friends and family

Walking and runnings feels very good You can actually feel the boost working for you

I love the way they feel on my feet they so comfortable

Shoe has everything you could ask for But the price was set by the hype of a new product

it is the best shoe The other boost models are still great But the ultraboost is the one

It was recommended by my son It fits well and comfortable

Thanks for making a 14 Hard to find that size Love the looks and comfort

For the money I expected so much more they should feel great the moment you put them on

Yes yes I am yes because yes and yes I do yes because yes

There extremely comfortable and I am extremely happy with my purchase

I bought these shoes for my son as a Christmas gift and he can not stop telling me how much he loves them

Great durable shoe Comfort level is superior Nice feel around the ankle with great support my son is hard on shoes so this is a well invested purchase

it is very good and comfortable and it feels like walking on clouds

Feels like I am walking on clouds By far the most comfortable shoes I have ever own Bought them in both black and white and coming back for more

Looks good very comfortable Uppers too soft near no resistance so feels like your foot is sliding off the sole

Shoea are comfortable to wear The color is nice and can fit any color for your sports outfit

Great shoe Hands down best on the market Like walking on air

Although the shipping took a lot of time the shoes look really good and and are extremely comfortable totally recommend

The cushioning on the Ultraboosts are extremely comfortable the shoes are stylish and they are very durable

very well made beautiful design very excellent comfort could be a little wider

Extreme comfort Now I will never purchase another casual shoe

Shoe color way looks great Red is not orange this time But Quality is trash

They run a few sizes small would recommend but try them on first

I love this product because it is such a comfortable shoe and fit great The only problem I have is that the plastic scuffs easily otherwise greatest shoe

After 5 years with same running shoe different brand switched these and have been

It was a gift Size is small so currently still in the process of returning If the returns goes well I will purchase again

Very comfortable and clean I like the 1 0 looking arrow pattern on the toe

Boost is amazing design is too nice dark burgundy is the way to go it was love at first site

I love everything about it the way it feels he size the way it looks it is overall a great shoe

High quality and comfortable shoe Recommend a half size bigger than usual Maybe a full size

Quality is great and it matches it good with daily wear as well

Shoe size runs a little large for me Overall a great shoe

First if all this shoe is very comfortable when working out The addidas ultraboost are also very nice and catches alot of people eye

Extremely comfortable with solid construction I will wear these everyday

very comfortable sneaker probably one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned

The Best Running shoes you will ever have worth every bit of a

The cage is translucent looks brown sometimes and scratches easily Not any great filtration and the feet get warm easily

As a New Yorker and athlete I am always on the lookout for a comfortable durable shoe I settled on the Ultraboost and was not disappointedthe shoe is very comfortable when both walking and running offering support and cushion I purchased a half size down from my typical 9 5 to a 9 and it is snug on the sides with a bit of room on the toe Would recommend

Really comfortable shoe I would recommend to anyone who likes to walk on clouds

christmad gift for my Grandson he obviously liked the shoes his words were they are awesome I wear them everywhere 

I had pure climaboosts before these and I assumed since they both had boost and were adidas running shoes that the sizing would be the same but it was not so A 12 pure boost fit me perfectly whereas my 12 of ultraboost is too narrow I do have wider feet and so that is why but the ultraboost shoe is much skinnier I would not change the shoe next time I will get a half size bigger but I can not this time cuz these ones sold out too quick

Best shoe ever comfortable great for running or just wearing

Very comfortable durable matches with any outfit

My husbandfeet always hurtuntil I bought him these They truly took all the pain away and he feels like he is running on pillows

I have read many reviews and have looking into ultra boost for a while now and everywhere said they are amazing I finally got a pair and they have a sew line or something that causes a welt sort of thing on the top of my foot and massive amounts of pain and makes the shoe awful I am not sure the direct cause but the shoe has some sort of major error and hurts to much to withstand I do not know if it is only my pair or if every pair has this but I wish I spent my money elsewhere

Awesome style and awesome fit Got many compliments wearing the shoe

Style and comfort makes these sneakers better than others

The prime knit is a little tighter which gives it a little more support

Perfect shoe for those who stand walk or run alot

Ultra boost has definately reignited my passion for sneakers and the limitless comfort in a great looking shoe I am excited for the future of comfort that Adidas will bless us all with

love the shoes Everything i am looking for wish they were more true to size

after only one month the eye lit ripped in half so mad

This Christmas present was a hit My son loved them

Love the color way and look of the shoe My foot is wider than average Wish there was a way to customize wider feet

Comfort is out of this world It was just awesome ask anyone

These shoes are the most comfortable ones I have ever worn They also look extremely nice Would highly recommend them

Purchased Ultraboost sad gift Recipient loves it Delivered as advertised Would buy again

Ordered these for my husband as a Christmas gift He loves them

Ultra boost is very comfortable I would buy the shoe again

This is the best shoe I have bought I want them all

Very comfortable Best shoe purchase ever Worth the money

The UltraBoost 4 0 took a shoe i thought could not get any better UB 3 0 and improved it in every way i could not even see The knit is softer and firmer than before it hugs my foot and once again the boost is absolutely impeccable No shoe rivals this in the least

These shoes are absolutely great The boost provides great comfort on your feet

These are the best fitting shoes I have ever worn My old shoes I xef xb8 x8f wore everyday

The boost is so nice This is my first pair of adidas as far as I can remember at least The shoes are the most comfortable I have ever had and I have already got 2 pairs of the 3 0s and I plan to continue collecting them and cop multiple pairs of 4 0s

These shoes are very cushiony I have bad feet but with the Ultra Boost my feet never hurt I will be getting more of these shoes

My feet get sore and blister easily these shoes solved that problem like walking on a cloud Highly recommend

My shoes white came looking used The soles were dirty and the insole wrinkled My grandson cleaned them before he even wore them

1 Could you get them any more whiteLol these joints are foreal white For some reason I did not think it was going to be as white as they are The roommate loves them perfect size perfect comfort perfect color way combo

I love these shoes And I think everyone should have them

Very stylish and comfortable The color is very nice

They are super comfortable stylish and all around the best shoes I have ever had

The shoes were for my husband and he is very picky with his shoes because of the comfort and look and adidas made those shoes perfect the comfort is amazing and the look is on point

Fit my son perfect said his favorite xmas present this year

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned perfect for running or all day use

After wearing them for eight hours it seemed they were cutting off the circulation on the top of my feet This was with them very loosly tied Keep in mind I am 5 11 and 180 pounds so my feet are not fat However my first pair that are the same design do not do this so they just need some breaking in I assume Boost for life

The most comfortable sneakers I have ever had The best invention

Very comfortable shoe exactly what was thought of product Great shoe

The best most comfortable shoes in the world currently Holy Grail of sneakers The most prized pair of shoes in my possession

I purchased these ultra boost back in August and they were by far the most comfortable shoes I have worn However after only going walking these last 4 months the continental brand web tread wore out quickly and underneath the soles cracked tore I believe this to be a manufacturering defect since I have owned much cheaper shoes and worn them longer without the cracking or tear in the soles Again these are incredibly comfortable but sadly did not hold up

so light and so fast so light and so fast so light

It feels amazing and it looks amazing it is good quality

Son loved the way the shoes looked and felt Overall loved them

It is very easy to slip your foot into the shoe It feels snug around the foot and even though i keep the laces loose the shoe hugs your foot and wraps around it comfortably I have not walked in them for a very long time while wearing them but from what I can tell they are very comfortable in general I also like that the upper material is able to flex but is not as flimsy as the 3 0

Had heard about the Ultra Boost hype but never worn a pair Had a couple pair of NMDbut the UB is wayyyyy more comfortable Definitely recommend

My son loves this shoe He owns a pair of Pure Boost and is over the moon to have these Ultra Boost Extreme comfort

All good best boost yet Lines are much sleeker

They are comfortable and they fit me perfect The colorway of the shoes are so cool

Very comfortable Fast shipping Good quality Will purchase again if needed

Well made and very comfortable for walking or running

DOPE af I Love these and they make me happy I was very depressed until I found these but now i can finally live a care free life style MY dude these sheits are fire and totally worth the cop

They are super comfy they have a clean look to them

The ultra boost 4 0 are very comfortable and have a great design

SVINTBOOST on twitter adidas group career is my dreeeam

Bought as a gift for a sneaker head and he was happy with them Good looking shoe

I have nearly every boost product and by far these are the most comfortable shoes ever

The adidas 4 0 is by far the best as far as comfort and design I am am very happy with my purchase my only suggestion would be to go a half size down so it can fit just snug around the toes if you stay true to size you might feel it a little loose around the toes where it would feel like you have clown feet

My teenage son loves these shoes Very comfortable and stylish

Very Comfy shoes would buy another colorway next time

Very comfortable shoe The only problem i have is that it was a little big

You can wear these to almost anything but the white gets dirty quickly Overall shoe does not rip and the boost stays the same

Highly recommended and very comfortable son loves it

Son loved them for Christmas This was one of his favorite gifts and he was excited

I like the shoes because its very comfortable good quality light weight and it feels like your just wearing socks

Super comfy shoe I love the color way The quality of the show is excellent

Ultra Boost are amazing for women and men I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas who typically wears a size 12 in shoes I knew he really wanted them so I went ahead and order the 11 5 They are a bit tight but he still loves them He typically likes his tennis shoes lose but these look great and he loves how comfortable they are

I purchased two pair for my grandsons They love them

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I xef xb8 x8f love them

love the product wish they had more interesting colors

I have wanted these shoes for awhile and received them The size 14 fot as expected Very comfortable and stylish Love the boost and primeknit combination

Bought these for my brother for Christmas He loves it more than he loves me

The shoes are awesome The maroon color is very cool and be dressed up or down They are very comfortable as well

To say these shoes are comfortable would be an understatement

my son said they are really comfortable and would buy them in every colorif he could

My nephew wanted these for Christmas and he has great taste The were perfect

This was for my 17 year old but now my husband wants to steal them Best shoes he said he has ever owned Super comfortable Def recommend well worth the money

Great quality Shoes are a comfortable fit I will be purchasing another pair in the near future

product good but not worth the price especially for teeneagers

From the cushion to the fit this shoe screams comfort It fits snug without being too tight and the material breathes great Not to mention it just looks fantastic

Got this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend We went off the Adidas sizing chart which said a 8 5 would fit him perfectly but actually ended up being too small Boyfriend is typically a size 9 So now we have to exchange for a size 9 Lol Basically these shoes run true to size and I would not follow the sizing chart Just go with your typical shoe sizes

Slight changes But maintains classic look and great comfort as usual

Most comfortable shoes I have bought and so light and breathable Awesome work adidas

Good shoe only slightly small around the middle width wise but I have wide feet so that might just be me

Got my son these for Christmas the bomb as he calls them Best gift ever

Great shoe definitely lives up to the hype extremely comfortable

My son loves them They are exactly what he has been wanting and he was not disappointed

i like these and the boost is perfect butvapormax4lyfe

The product is great shoe Great comfort and just looks great overall

I like this product for its stability it provides during my HIIT cardio training Comfortable material cool mesh keeps my feet dry Torsion system has great surface adaptation and provides support for both forefoot and rear foot

Ordered my normal size and my toes were smashed in the toe box very comfortable boost sole

Most comfortable shoes ever perfect fit Great gift idea

Prompt delivery of a sized and colors hard to find Expensive but worth it

The Ultra Boost is the best shoe on the market period Whether you are looking for a fashion statement or a true running shoe these are the ultimate

I am a Physical Education teacher and on my feet all day Thee shoes help me get through the day in the most comfortable way possible

I do not use these shoes to run in but it is great that if I am lazy I can wear these with gym shorts and if I want to dress good I can wear them with jeans and still look and feel great

The new pattern for the knit upper grew on me to be honest The ridge like pattern along the sides really stands out and is different than previous versions However the upper looks and feels thicker and better quality than before because of the new knit material

Soft and light weight and if fit him well for being a size 15

1st Pair of Adidas I have been a long time Nike and jordan guy for over 35 years Also have a few pair of Cole HannThese are by far the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn

This is one of the most stylish and comfortable shoe

Ultra boost lives up the hype and continues to get better

I absolutely love these shoes They fit great Look great Have outstanding comfort

For the price I paid I would have expected better quality out of the ultra boost

The boost technology feels so good on my foot that i have bought multiple pairs of ultraboosts The primeknit upper is light and very breathable

I like It it is very comfy but you get holes and your laces become torn up very easily

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and love the look

I struggle with finding good shoes that fit me My left foot is a 14 right is a 15 and i went with some 15s here this time Its like walking on a cloud No chafe spots great support everything i could ask for in a shoe

This has taken over the top spot of my boost collection I thought the my EQT 93 17 would always be the comfiest pair But i was wrong UltraBOOST is King

I love the product because it is quality I will buy it again in a diffent color

These are the best shoes ever So comfortable and so stylish Wish the price was lower

I like the style of it although as someone who wears 9 5 it feels squished when I got them in 9 5 The top of my foot is constantly red after I take them from wearing them from at least an hour

The most Comfortable and supportive shoe I have ever bought

love this shoe i do not run in them just wear them casually every day the 4 0 primeknit on the grey remind me of the primeknit on the1 0 which is AWESOME

Super fresh Love the boosts like walking on clouds cliche

Very comfortable soft and light price of the shoe is a bit expensive i need to get pick on next yeezy relase

do not get me wrong these shoes are sick The colors are amazing and I would definitely recommend them The only thing I did not really care for was the comfort This is my first pair of ultra Boost and I thought they would be a lot more comfortable I have a couple pairs of NMDand in my opinion the NMDare more comfortable Thank you adidas for the sick releases and keep it coming

The 9 and a half seems a tad long and at the same time the fit around the upper foot was kind of snug Once I pulled the soles out the fit was perfect

Love these shoes Just do not understand why sizing changes with each version You may want to 1 2 size up unless you like your shoes tight even when you

Super comfy One of the most comfortable shoes I have tried on I use to be an avid Racer and Free connoisseur but this shoe is crazy

it is very comfortable but soon it starts to appear holes on the shoe

Perfect wish there was more than just the design to make these a limited show with the increased price

Great design Very comfortable Excellent quality

Ultra boost 4 0 is great and the new colorways are amazing Love the new patterns on theses shoes

I like the product because it is very styled at this time I would say it is hyped

Love the boost Great fit Feels comfortable to walk around in

I like the new 4 0 feel but I wish there was more colors mixed in like the 3 0

So i owned these shoes for about a month when they started to get roughed up First of all i gotta say these shoes are REDICULOUSLY COMFORTABLE I love the noise boost makes everytime they step However i have to say that the plastic pieces on the shoes did not hold up well The plastic got scratched up very easily and then one day when i went to tie my shoes the cage just snapped I do think though that for the comfort i would buy them again and just be extra cautious

it is as if you are walking on clouds great pair of shoes and are aesthically pleasing at the same time

Easy to wear with anything and the most comfortable shoe on the market

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Own 4 pairs and can not stop buying

comfy

Runs slightly bigger than the 3 0 but other than that I feel this is one of the best Ultraboost models Prime knit is thicker and breathable Overall I give this 9 10

I have a few pairs of these already and they are the best Finally added these to the mix

Would buy a hundred of these if I could comfortable

Sizing and comfort are top notch My first time buying an adidas shoe and I am very impressed

Very comfortable and sporty but stylish at the same time

Even with wide feet the PK has enough give to make these comfortable The boost sole on these are a league ahead in terms of comfort compared to pureboost and NMDs Will buy another

Comfort quality stylish and performance Would buy again and again

Very Nice and comfortable The colorway is also very nice

Son wanted them as a Birthday gift I would not buy them as an everyday purchase I think it is really crazy to spend that much on sneakers Needless to say he did not get anything else for his birthday

it is comfort like no other sneaker out there Great for casual wear gym lounging around the house it is amazing For a swole guy with size 13 feet these are great for my workouts and just going out

Amazing shoe my first pair of ultraboost actually but runs a little small I am normally a size 8 so I got a 8 5 thinking that would be enough room but it was not Go at least one full size up if you do not wanna deal with returning the shoes

The shoes look blue online but once I received them they are more green Turquoise

Get 1 2 size larger I was debating to get 1 2 size smaller because everyone says ultraboost runs large But I decided to get true to size and they are a little tight

Love the shoes only hitch is they run a little big

So comfy this this all the flaws from the 3 0 2 0 1 0 to make the perfect 4 0

The Ultraboost 4 0 sizing is perfect the boost torsion system primeknit continental and everything about this shoe is awesome It is the most comfortable shoe I have wear

Bought the 3 0 and love how comfortable for walking But I would not run in it because of heel slippage and the outsole wears out so fast Since the outsole is make from winter tire material it is soft and grippy but wears about fast I have had it for about half a year and I am about to no rubber in the front of the shoe But love how comfortable it is and wish it was cheaper

Great quality product Very comfortable and perfect fit

Comfort I do not understand the required words

Yes the best quality of shoes that to wear nowadays

I like this shoe because it is very comfortable and stylish

Should have gotten 1 2 larger comfortable but size 1 2 up

SIZE TOO NARROW NO COMFTY WASNT EXPECTED SIZE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER MODELS

Color is even better in person Very happy with my purchase

Very comfortable Good looking shoes Come in a little smaller than advertised Ordered a nine and they are more like an eight and a half

Super clean super comfortable super stylish YUHH

I found one problem with these ultra boost and that is while running it is so hard to turn corners because the upper sole does not keep my feet steady and therefore i have to slow down and turn so that i do not risk injury So any lateral movements is limited with these shoes Also not good for any lateral plyometric movement at the gym i learnt the hard way But Overall an amazingly comfortable and multipurpose shoe for everyday style walking or straight runs

Fantastic shoe quality with the best comfort Will buy another pair in the future

The cushioning spring back and fit are amazing The quality of construction and materials are impressive Excellent breath ability but warm enough for winter walking

these are incredible they fit better than the 3 0s

One of the most comfortable shoes I ever owned and have 0 complaints But the colors on the website are kinda hard to see as i got the core black looks much lighter in the daylight I am a 9 5 in pureboost and a 9 fit perfect for the ultra boost 3 0

Most comfortable shoe ever Absolutely recommend these shoes

My feet is wide so I have to order 1 2 size bigger it is comfortable but tight on the arch

These are easily the best sneakers I have ever owned They look even better on your foot than they do in the photos and the comfortability is through the roof it is a kind of supportive comfortability that does not feel like you are just sinking into some cushy foam

The shoes are the best comfortable and look pretty sweet too

the most comfortable shoes I ever had in my life I will definitely recommend it

High quality comfort What could be betterA basic everyone must have

Got the new triple white 4 0 Ultra Boost in and they look really good I like the black bottoms on them and the new pattern is dope They fit a lot more true to size then the 3 0 so I would not go down half a size just stick to your true sizing Comfortable as to be expected If you do not already have a white pair of ultra boost I recommend

Great shoe but why do we have to enter the drab color phase againAdidas please provide some color options

LITERALLY takes ages to find my size but Adidas pulled through Now I got my size 15 Ultraboost

Very comfortable and sturdy running shoe Great feel and feels great to run Cushioning feels great

unstable response technology shortens your stride to increase transition for those who weigh over 180lbs this shoe will damage your feet

I first bought pure boost last 2016 in Japan and i love it so i decided to buy these ultraboost and it is very comfortable for two months i use it 4 times a week Now my third Boost are on the way the ultraboost uncaged I did not get a chance to finish my order when the time Ace 16 was launched and I am hoping soon there will be an available size for me

I have flat wide feet with no arch so it is extremely hard for me to find shoes of comfort in which I typically would wear sandals But weather changing and sandals are not the best for feet I needed good shoes I was skeptic with Addidas at first And thought they looked funny but I was wrong soo comfortable These shoes are pricey but worth it it is like a tempur pedic for your feet

So I have 3 pairs of NMDs and 1 one pair of ultraboost 3 0 But the 4 0s are a game changer for good

This is my 4th pair of ultra boost and I love them all Comfort is unmatched by ANY other shoe on the market boostislife3stripelife

Boost is super responsive and fit is more true to size than my 3 0

UB has been one of my favorite silhouettes and version 1 0 as my all time favorite because of the knit pattern I purchased UB 4 0 because it has some of the UB 1 0 pattern with additional parallel lines running from toe to heel which I am not a fan of To me that ruined the otherwise perfect pattern It would have looked cleaner The pattern reminds me of the NMD bedwin cw and I absolutely hate them

It has great comfort and they are so light with such great fit on the ankle

As a flat footed person its hard to find shoes that can be comfortable all day My foot pain and knee pain has almost disappeared The kicks are so comfortable I rather wear them around the house than just wearing socks

This is my fourth pair and I am really happy about it Best shoes i ever had

These shoes feel like Jesus is kissing your feet with every step

The Best and most comfortable sneakers I have ever had my entire life Love these Just need more different colors

A must purchase Most comfortable shoe ever worn

My son loves them and brags about them so enough said

Design is eye popping

love the Ultraboost lineeach generation gets better and better If you maintain your boostsit will certainly last a white

I am flat footed and have fairly wide feet so I was reluctant at first to buy a pair of shoes that were slightly narrow but as soon as I put them on all my worries were gone The Ultra Boost is probably the most comfortable shoe that I have ever had on my feet The comfort and support that the Boost sole provides is groundbreaking I never used to like running until I bought the Ultra Boost

Hands down the Ultraboost line smashes every other sneaker I have worn I am on my feet 12 hours a night and the 3 variants of the Ultraboost that I have purchased are beyond a pleasure to wear

Great Shoe you will need to make sure you have the appropriate Size and Width before finalizing your purchase I typically wear a size 13 but with this show I had to purchase a size 14 and 15 via Commerce to find the correct shoe size Size 15 is perfect but I was not expecting to go up two sizes to get the right size

These are the best shoes I have ever worn I am on my 4th pair right now and the quality just keeps getting better and better over the years It feels like you are walking on clouds

I am looking for 4 0 with new modern

These shoes are amazing The quality and comfort is impressive I had high standards for this shoe and it certainty surpassed my expectations

Lots of comfortable padding It does not get less comfy Have had a pair for a year and just got a second pair Great Overall shoe

The shoe is very confortable The materials are high quality and the color is bright

I have been wearing my Ultra Boosts casually for about a month when the foam started splitting and tearing away from the upper Very disappointing for such an expensive shoe

This is by far and away the most comfortable pair of Adidas I have ever had

Also these look much better then the 3 0 Loving that 1 0 pattern material again

I was a little skeptical at first like I always am when a new UB comes out The 4 0 does not disappoint First off the fit reminds me more of a 1 0 2 0 The primeknit is a little more stiff then the 3 0 Which I really like The tounge has a little more padding then past models as well And my fav part is the stitching which kinda reminds of of the 1 0

Heel cup on both shoes are a bit loose Have to lace them super tight to get me heel to stay put Not worth the high cost

If you are debating to buy these shoes do it already

multi color for life because you already know boost for life

they are perfect and comfortable They forced me to go for run in the morning I am happy with them

Have had a pair for a year and still in great condition

Ultraboost continues to be the best shoe out there right now Great look amazing comfort

Fits Great Looks Great I Recommend This Shoe For Everyone

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I consider myself a huge sneaker head and on pretty much every shoe this is by for the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

They are super comfortable and just the right size

This is my first pair of adidas this caught my eye on the looks

The comfort is the best The texture it self is a very good one

Fresh kicks the freshest of kicks that I have rocked in my days Love them

They are comfortable Feels like walking on nothing They look nice

The shoe is just incredibly comfortable but also has the support for running May be the best athletic show I have ever had

Very comfortable would recommend for running and style

The boost is really responsive compared to other made by Adidas with the Ultraboost

The shoes are super comfortable but the color was not what it looked like in the picture Grey trace pink

Light and comfortable Want to wear only as casual shoes instead of running in them that is how good they feel

Bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it Her foot is a little wide but it fitted her perfectly

I love the utility black ultra boost shoes They are super comfortable very light nice quality material Great for walking or being out on your feet all day I love this color Black with a dark grey looks very nice Would recommend thid shoe to anyone looking for real comfortable shoes

Walking on clouds all day this is my 4th pair and I will continue to buy them as long as they make them

I want every color Especially the all white I can wear these shoes with any situation and are beyond comfortable

I liked it cause it was mad comfortable Amazing bruh

comfortable great looking easy to clean water proof but with a couple of runs it already feels degraded

Yes I love the shoe and definitely worth the money

Very comfortable Like the color and fit They are awesome

Comfortable and lightweight for everyday use based on specific needs from work outdoors and hiking

Most comfortable running shoe I have owned Bought 4 other pairs

The shoes are so comfy fit like a glove and look So clean

Super comfortable but they run small maybe 1 2 a size bigger would be good

Adidas has really stepped up their game The ultraboosts are amazingly comfortable look great and well made Between these and the Tubular Shadows that I purchased I have not been happier with casual shoes in quite some time Highly recommended

Personally I did not think it would look on me because it kinda looked a bit manlier in the pictures But when I got them the burgundy color looked quite feminine as well These are also one of my most comfiest shoes I own next to the yeezys and nmds Great purchase recommend 100

Purchased these for my son and he is very happy with them

I loved them so much I bought a second pair when my first pair started showing wear Now 2 years 1300 miles on 2 pairs of shoes I am happy with that So far 830 miles this year alone Running 25 miles a week About to buy my 3rd pair as I start training for a marathon

They fit like a glove very comfortable shoes i will definitely recomended

Best shoe I have ever bought Most comfortable shoe out there Not much of a high performance runner but if you need it to be than it can get the job done

I have bad feet from playing sports all my life I have had many a foot operation because of it I have spend money at the doctors office on there corrective shoes They never helped But once I got these shoes my feet feel amazing I can play all my old sports workout all day and my feet never hurt I have 4 pars then I bought 2 pars for my parents and 2 for my daughter Tell whoever is making these thank you so much and Adidas rules

These kicks are fire Best shoe ever in comfort and fit Love the different color ways

First purchase ever and I have not regretted it at all Seriously worth every penny Look even better in person

it is the best looking and best feeling shoe on the market

Boost technology continues to be the best support for your feet

I dislike this product because getting a pair with black soles is next to impossible

I was excited to get these but they are not as comfortable as everyone says as they are very narrow They should maybe running shoes for actual men with man size feet I digress bottom line is I returned them and if you have wide feet look elsewhere

I recently bought a pair of UltraBOOST and I can not get over how comfortable they are The Primeknit is so breathable and stretchy and comfortable but the most important of all the boost midsole the boost is incredibly responsive Much more responsive then that of the NMD And every time you take a single step you feel the energy being absorbed and returned its an amazing feeling I could walk all day in these shoes These do run narrow so people with wide feet if you are a size 10 than go up half a size or true to size because these run true to size if you have a narrow foot you should probably go for your same size These are amazing I highly recommend you buy these

Looks great fits great very comfortable Perfect maroon color

The product was overpriced by a long shot Need some improvements in stability

Primeknit frayed kind of disappointed Needs durability

bought to run but not the best for running great for casual wear

been running in them for a couple weeks now with no issues and its one of the most comfortable running shoes I ever wore

Only thing I do not like about the shoe is the thin black rubber sole it is not quite durable enough and will not last as long as I would Like it too If they fix that I will buy another pair for sure The nit design does have some limitations in terms of foot securment in the shoe but plus side of it is it is very free feeling like I am just wearing a sock rather than a shoe Otherwise probably the most comfortable running shoe ever

Look I have read tons of reviews and heard a lot of GREAT reviews for these shoes so I decided to purchase them for work My feet kill me each day and I needed comfort After ordering these and trying them out for a week there was not really much relief at all Maybe it is the fact that I work on cement floors all day and at this point I do not think any shoe will help me Unless there is any suggestions for me If you are not working on cement floors all day test these out They are comfortable but not in the work field

Right sizing and color is just like the picture These shoes are the most comfortable thing I own I bought these specific ones for my boyfriends upcoming birthday and he has going to love adding these to his boost collection

It was a great choice in shoe and is very stylish and comfy

When I got the ultra boost it was so comfy and not narrow Get it right away I thought they would be sold out but they were not Trust me they look way better in person

I love the design But it felt like the shoe was going to fall off because the heels are not secure enough in the backend of the shoe even though the shoe felt very tight on my feet Wish I could try a size bigger Wonder if adidas would help

It is a great looking and very comfortable Thanks adidas

Think they run a tad big due to the flexible material

Very comfortable shoe It is worth the price It gets scratched easily though

I was lucky enough to get my ultra boosts in the size and color I wanted and was very pleased with them until the actual boost mid sole detached from the prime knit upper and also caused a crack split vertically in the boost Another somewhat minor problem is the fraying that occurs arond the toe area but this can be dealt with using a fabric shaver Overall I really liked the shoe but I was displeased with the incident regarding the separation of sole and upper

I like this shoes very much is too good and Comfortable

They are flex and go with anything the beat shoe but I ordered them too small so

This shoe is tremendous The design is awesome and the comfort is unparalleled They look great and would definitely recommend them to anyone

Amazing shoe super comfy when am out and about Very stylish with regular wear and great for running

Yeah this product is awesome I recommend them especially if your foot is narrow This shoe is slightly narrow on my feet personally but the primeknit is stretchy witch evens it out Overall the product is great and I recommend it

These are the only sneakers that are extremely tight in the ankle area i would like a refund

These shoes fell apart after less than a month and a half of wearing them Terrible quality for the price The sol of the shoe began to completely separate from the top Would not recommend for the price as they will only fall apart shortly after purchase

Let me start by saying I have not owned a pair of Adidas shoes since high school With that said these shoes are amazing I have own quite a few of other brands but the comfort in these have left me not wearing any other shoes The type of comfort is not comparable to any of them I would put it to feel like a high quality memory foam mattress They are built very well it seems like I watched a YouTube video where someone wore them a year and tentatively put 1000 miles on them they were the 1s though I wear them whenever I am off work since I have to wear boots at work If I was to guess I would say I have put easily 50 miles on them with no sign of wear on the tread They are getting dirty on the primeknit and the Boost material but only the primeknit because my wife and I have a 3 month old German Shepherd that love to step on them when we are outside The fit for me is perfect some might say they are snug but I like my shoes like that I ordered my normal size As they look right now I am willing to say they will last years for me I have no complaints about these shoes at all and I can not wait to see what newer versions will bring The only thing I wish they would do in the future is bring back the limited edition leather cage ones

Its a slick all day every day shoe every comfortable only down side about it the shoe is a snug fit so i would recomend going a half size up other then that you really get yourself a pair now

This colorway of the Ultraboost 3 0 is highly underrated They look great on foot I prefer them to a few of my limited edition colorways They are Ultraboost so the comfort is great need not be mentioned but I mentioned it anyway since they are that comfy you can not go wrong with ANY Ultraboost but this colorway is a sleeper Wake up cop folks

I have been a long time other brand shoe fan but I loved this shoe since the first time I tried them on Great fit feel comfort and style but once I bought them I realized that the outsole provided little if any traction in the gym or any smooth surface It almost seems like the outsole has been worn down for a long time even though they are brand new I still love them just wish the continental outsole was better

I had NMDbefore and they were great but after I bought these ultraboosts I have only been wearing them because they are the most comfortable shoes ever

If you do not own ultra boost you are doing yourself a disservice They are objectively the most comfortable shoe ever made

Its just a comfortable and great shoe I love the color

These shoes are beyond comfortable They did feel a little bit tight when i got them but within the first couple days they stretched to fit my feet perfectly I highly reccommend these shoes to anyone The price is a bit much but in todays world you get what you pay for And these are worth every penny

This is a very comfortable shoe The comfort is amazing

GET IT IF YOU CAN

Buy all the ones I can get Want triple blacks

best qualiti chip very fast deliveri aaaaaaa good good

it is better looking than pictures show and more comfortable than it looks like to be

I like the shoe cause it is fashionable and comfortable

This shoe is amazing for doing anything for ex and al going to school or going for a run

This shoe is amazing it has a perfect build it is light weight for if you want to excersise in them or if you wear them for design then there also very stylish

Are there any differences between mens and womens ultra boosts beside sizing Ive read some people say that womens are more narrow and snug fitting than mens is that correct

The cushion inside the shoes and on the heel is perfect

Great shoe have like 10 pairs of boost and they never disappoint Training for my second marathon wearing them and would not wear anything else

One the the best Ultra Boost Colorways ever super stylish

Fits true to size Bought my wife a pair and she loves them too Love Ultraboost shoes

Shoes are amazingly comfortable Probably one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes that I have ever owned

I love how comfortable the shoe is but after about 3 months of wear they have already ripped and the sides are falling apart

I love the product because best for long periods and running I think it is the best product in the shop

litter than my mom amazing its just way toooooo expensive

I am a huge fan of the Ultra Boost I have a white one already and wanted a new color so I went for the blue one When I received it I was sorely disappointed There was still evidence of glue where it was put together and the blue was not blue whatsoever It was more of a teal or bluish green Immediately returned it back to them do not recommend anyone buys anything blue from Adidasyou will probably get anything but blue

I love the style of the shoe and the various colors

I have had lower spine issues for years and avoided a lot of shoes that have extra support because they just look horrible Adidas has found the perfect balance of comfort and style I have bought 5 pairs of ultra boost caged and uncaged in the past 3 months Looking forward to more colorways being released

Colorway is awesome and the sneaker is extremely comfortable Love these shoes

This product is really comfortable and looks fantastic but was a little pricey For me it is perfect because I keep my sneakers well cleaned and in good condition so for me it was a good investment All I would say is it is a little expensive but that is the price of a quality comfort sneaker

The ultraBOOST is Adidas best shoe The cushioning is off the charts and they look great The price is completely worth it I am on my 4th pair and will not go back to any other shoe

Very comfortable but the white gets done try very quickly They need to come with a shirt care guide

Purchased it as a gift for my bro in law and my wife They love it Bought true to size and it fits perfect for both Very comfortable stylish and functional

The shoe is very comfortable and easy to wear for long periods Good for running and outdoor wear Amazing quality long lasting Very clean and nice looking shoes Personally favorite shoes on the market

These are my 10th or 11th pair of Boosts but might be the best ones yet I love the improvements made on the 3 0 Sooooo doooooooope

This is the absolute best running shoe I have ever had it is so comfortable to wear I highly recommend this shoe I did not think a running shoe could feel this good

The aglet fell off on the first day and I was very disappointed

One of the best shoes I ever bought great design and top quality of the shoes

Best shoes ever Would highly recommend to anyone

As described very comfortable Lightest shoe I have ever worn that does not sacrifice support

This shoe is amazing all my life I have had problems with my feet I could never find a sneaker that did not leave my feet aching halfway through the day until I got my first pair of ultraboosts These are the only sneaker I know I can wear for days on end that feel like I am walking barefoot 10 stars

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I will order a 2nd pair for sure

I have ten pairs of ultra boost and one NMD and just ordered the new R2 primeknit that came out Saturday

Super dope and super comfortable I also heard that these have wool mixed in with the prime knit too is that true

Love the color do not see this color too often ultra boost is so comfortable

Shoes are very comfortable I have never had a shoe that fits so perfectly

The ultraboost is a very comfortable shoe and a staple in my collection

Have a few ultra boost already and the new ones are just like the old ones

Very comfortable design is nice no complaints whatsoever

Very comfortable and look really good I recommend this shoe

They are really comfortable for running and walking They look amazing and they fit perfect for my feet Best purchase

The crafting of the Ultra Boost must be significantly harder than the crafting of other shoes because catching the comforts of clouds and the feeling of awesomeness akin to surfing behind a cruise ship on a lava field chased by flying llamas that spit acid can not be easy

Great fit and comfort Always look forward to see what is coming next

I just bought this shoes because they look great and Kanye West worn them 1 2 size up super comfortable shoe

Immediate comfort with style the wool provides extra warmth and a less loose fitting compared to the first 3 0 primeknit releases

The boost technology is unlike any other I highly recommend these to anybody looking for a comfortable pair of shoes This is my second pair with boost and I am just as in love with the first pair as I am with the second

Comfortable stylish goes with everything lasts a long time No reason not to buy

Get more color ways

Very comfortable All White will get dirty very easy if not extremely careful

Good yes much pleasure Looks and how it feels

The color does not match its description it look like purple rather then maroon

Shoes are awesome great fit very light love them

Very comfortable running shoe Will definitely be buying another pair

Awesome pair of shoes Great Comfort Quality and Colorway

I told myself this was the last ub let us see how long I believe that

My son loves them Price is a little high but happy with them

Basically what I just said I have not worn it outside yet so take my review with a grain of salt

Quality style and comfort all in one Shipping was fast and the color way is perfect for the fall

So some friends at work are total boost heads and turned me on to it I have literally went from 0 pairs to 5 pairs in about 6 mths I love ultra boost so much It is soft and the prime knit is the best upper material I have ever worn THANKS ADIDAS

Most comfortable shoe out there would recommend to everyone

My son and I are into athletic shoes We buy and wear many many pairs I had noticed a few years ago that Adidias was beginning to clearly outpace Nike in sheer quality of workmanship materials and design This pair of Ultraboost are a prime example

Product is very stylish and comfortable Lots of color choices as well

You can not go wrong with a fresh pair of ultra boosts they are still the best shoe on the planet

I love these shoes there my favorite shoe just need more arc support

The deep burgundy pair was not really burgundy It was more of a purplish red Other than that you cannot go wrong with Ultra Boosts

The most comfortable running i ever owned I also bought the ultraboost laceless and uncaged they are amazing as well

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and I have tried them all

Couple of weeks ago I was stuck on whether to get the triple white NMD R1 or the Triple White Ultraboost and I chose the ultraboost and my oh my these shoes literally feel like no other I went 1 2 size up from a 9 5 to a 10 to give my feet some space to move around and the way they feel on your feet works some wonders I would give this all 5 stars but the boost do come with a few scratches and the delivery method is SO SLOW Other than that i would recommend these to anyone and the price is well worth it

Great comfortable shoe The best made shoe on the market

Bruh What are you waiting forDo your feet a favor order these nowMaxComfoetability

the only imperfection is a little bit of glue smudge on the heel cup

i like this product because it is stylish and really comfortable

I love this shoe so much it is my 7th pair of ultra boost

Stylish and comfortable Goes with any situation price is good and worth getting

Great shoe and super comfy The color is perfect

A1 comfort all day shoes best purchase true to size

it is confortable and a beautiful shoe in my opinion

This was my third pair of UltraBoost and I have already bought a fourth They are just so comfortable and I love all of the different colorways I feel like I need to collect them ALL Keep them coming Adidas I can not wait to check out the 4 0 

I had been looking for some new running shoes and heard about how comfortable the Ultra Boost were so I decided to get a pair Thankfully I was able to get a pair of the Multi Color and I absolutely love them These are easily the most comfortable running shoes I have ever worn and look great too I would definitely recommend going up 1 2 a size since they are a little snug

Long lasting quality casual and very comfortable

I like the fit color with and height Color good soft fit nice pack on my foot leg and sox

These were a birthday gift for my son He says they are the most comfortable sneakers he has ever worn and he is an athlete I hope they last as I think they are expensive

I like the Primeknit upper mainly because of its softness and flexibility However I think that because of the knit material it gets pretty warm on my feet when walking around I really like the design of the shoe and the comfort of the boost but I am somewhat disappointed in how my feet move completely off of the shoe when making any type of lateral movements Overall I still think this is a really stylish and pretty nice shoe

My favorite Ultra Boost 3 0 colorway The comfort is the same as all Ultra Boosts top notch

I love the product BUT I think we are all ready for 4 0 YOU guys have 154 color ways of 3 0 But overall it is the best shoe Boost I ever put on my foot i own 9 pairs in the last year

I did not buy these shoes for running so I can not speak on that issue but for wearing around they are incredibly comfortable I also love the way they look I have a wide foot and there is no problem with fit

Cool and comfortable design MOSTLY RECOMMENDED FOR Athletes

From someone who has Achilles tendinitis this has been a savior and I no longer have daily soreness I wear them all the time and hopeful I can start running again soon

I love these shoes they are super comfarble my number one shoe to go to

Best shoe out there but always has glue everywhere Every pair that i order always has manufacturer defects Adidas you guys need to step up your game

Good quality get what you paid for I am on my feet all day and my feet do not hurt

I absolutely loved my new Adidas UltraBoost The style is perfect for me and they are very comfortable I did get a size up because when I work out my feet can swell I like the color a lot the look very clean I am very happy with my purchase

The style is great looking and sooooo comfortable

Great fitting shoe and very comfortable when walking around or running

So I can not say that I have tried every shoe in the world but even if I had it would be hard to imagine a more comfortable shoe ever made it is like wearing my favorite most supportive pair of socks but with a supportive cloud attached to the sole I was not a huge fan of the look at first you know the whole styrofoam packing shell thing as the sole but once I wore them for a day I just do not even care anymore Now I finally get why my dad always wore such ugly shoes I am used to suffering for fashion but with all of this great new Adidas tech I no longer have to Comfy is the new cool for this young dad

These are one of the few shoes I can run in comfortably for 12 miles day I would say they are a little bulky heavy but the support I get from the soles make up for it Recommend them for anyone looking for a long distance running shoe

Adidas Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The colors and styles of the Ultra Boost are amazing

I have been waiting to buy a pair of black Ultra Boost I did not like the core black with the translucent cage so I am glad they dropped these I bought a pair for me and then loved them so much had to buy my husband a pair too I know sizing is weird for Adidas but these are def true to size

Just everything about it is amazing it is like wearing just socks

Comfortableand fashionable Very light and flexible love it

Arch support weak Thought they would feel like my boost 360 golf shoes

Almost perfect when I am wearing them it is like walking on clouds Best sneakers I have ever worn

The Ultraboost should be in every sneaker lovers collection It looks and feels excellent like walking on clouds Although I have had them only for a short time I can easily say they are the best shoe I have ever worn Looking for the downsides I have found very little The sole is flexible the fabric stretches and is breathable

Very comfortable and well made Great for casual wear and running

This is a really comfortable shoe and it so far has had good duribility but the price was a little much It is the most comfortable shoe that I have had to date and I really enjoy wearing them Would be a 5 star product if the price was a little less never less the shoes are great

These bad boys are perfect Go true to size if you decide to purchase

Its just such a great shoe Nothing is as comfortable as this shoe and is equal in looks I will definitely buy another pair

I love these shoes They are easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever had They accommodate my wide feet just like all other Adidas shoes usually do so you have wide feet and are used to wearing a certain Adidas size I would just go with that size All this being said I would like to say that the sole of the shoes scares me it seems like it will degrade very quickly because there is little to it They are made well there is just little surface area compared to other running or lifestyle shoes All this being said nothing would deter me from buy them again

Love the ultraboost it is so comfortable The side cages kind of dig into my foot sometimes but I am hoping that will change as I break them in some more

This has to be the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I came from wearing roshes but they were incredibly uncomfortable when wearing for long periods of time especially when running even a mile I went for a run immediately after my ultraboosts came in the mail and it made running feel effortless If you do have a pair of roshes and they fit snug you should order a half size up in this shoe You will have a little toe room but I had to compensate for the width of my foot Other than that amazing shoe and 10 10 would buy again

Very comfortable would recommend to everyone

Best shoes ever super comfortable and has boost Best Buy

I think these shoes feel comfortable because they grip my feet so tightly that I have no blood circulation to actually feel my feet Otherwise they are nice and I would consider ordering a half size up

On the best shoes I have ever bought comfort is out of this world The shoe fits great and looks even better 10 10 would recommend to anyone looking for a pair

Comfortable for everyday wear and looks good breathable material so my feet do not sweat

Ultra Boost are the comfiest shoes on the planet If only they were a bit less expensive i would buy multiple pairs FORSURE

great shoes originals comfortable and wonderful

Incredibly comfortable stylish and lightweight Will purchase again

Shoes have done a lot to alleviate my foot pain I have had multiple surgeries on my righ foot and I am a diabetic

The ultra boost is so cushionedI love it It feels like you are walking on a cloud

so comfortable and elegant you can wear it for the whole day without compaining

Bought my first pair last year and it is the only athletic shoe I have bought since I have gotten friends and family into buy these as well After trying them on it is like waking on clouds 

Goes great with jeans

Amazing feeling for the first time putting them on had LOTSSSS of turning heads when had them asking what shoes were they Very comfortable and also very stylish

I love the fit comfort and style The simple design customizable options and sound materials justify my decision to stick with Adidas for footwear

Very very comfy and stylish shoe Adidas did well

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The Utility Black color way looks even better in person

Got nothing to say because I am over the moon now

Had to treat myself to the best running I have worn so far

very comfortable and have great fit for my feet and love the color

Super Good for when I go to work as well as just for causal walking around

Its the best brand so comfortable and I recommend it for others as well

I have waited this ATR for ages and finally they are released The color is awesome and it is super comfortable Must buy

Overall the foam is comfortable for everyday walking and use Sneaker is stylish but they literally have NO arch support

Why do you need more infoI said I liked them This review text is too short apparently

Good shoe and will last

I like how comfortable the shoes is and love the color

Love them own multiple pairs will continue to wear boost

Best runing shoe on the marked i will cop more for sure

Definitely go true to size Very amazing colorway getting the CNY ultraboost 4 0

It is a great product extremely comfortable but it is a little expensive

Amazingly comfortable and attractive feels like you are walking on air but they could be made for people with a wider foot

I found these shoes to be amazing They are very comfortable have a great fit and look good with almost anything Definitely a great purchase

Super comfortable shoes as well as looking good with an outfit This shoe was everything I was looking for can not wait to see what other designs come out in the future Definitely recommend to a friend

Because the are my slyle and every one has them Tanner

cant really tell if it is wool or not but dope shoe no matter what

It is perfect and cheap It can be use for running or go to party And it is color also appreciated

Absolutely love the shoes Extremely comfortable Lightweight Good looking just a fantastic shoe

Very comfortable good toe space no blisters and feels very bouncy on my long runs

Its very comfortable and well made good quality

it is very comfortable and nice quality They are very dutiable and I plan on getting more

This shoe change the whole game This is when everybody turns around to look It is just perfect

Shoe is good looking and comfortable wool material is just amazing only issue I had was that there was a slight defect on a heel cage the plastic was somehow bended

Purchased for my son and he loves them He previously purchased the ultra boost last year and wanted this shoe again Very happy with these shoes

I like this product because it is comfortable while looking sleek

Litteraly the best purchase I have ever made Favorite shoe so comfy If you do not already have this shoe get it makes you experience perfect comfort and performance

I bought an all white size 10 and they were really long so I got these and went size 9 Both are really comfy but now with the right size it is perfect Converted 3 stripe member now

I like the product a lot This is the second pair I have gotten however I would have liked to have known that the insole was slightly changed because I think it raises my foot slightly

Great shoe Comfy as can be Just writing because i keep getting review too short message

These are definitely the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my entire life

Recommend to athletes and for casual wear The quality of this shoe is unmatched in the market today

Bought the ultraboost after a few friends recommended it to me The ultraboost are one of the best purchases I made Shoes are so comfy for everday use at university and stylish enough for a night out

When I got the shoe I realized it was defective with a bump on the prime knit of my left shoe It causes irritation when I run for longer distances It was also glued badly causing different toe space for each shoe The feeling that my left feet feels different from my right is very annoying I have already returned the shoe and I hope the next pair I get has better quality

Unbelievable comfort with quality you can feel it is a simple product that runs out of stock too fast Just to credit it is quality

They were delivered 36 hrs after I ordered them They were packaged perfectly Quality made They look and feel great according to my teenage son

These are the perfect pair of shoes They are great for running and for everyday wear I read they were 1 2 size big so I got a 9 instead of 9 5 and they fit perfect Glad I did otherwise it would have been to big I use them for walking and they are my daily go to shoes for whatever I wear The black color scheme goes with anything I run btw 60 80 miles a month and these are the most cushioned and comfy shoes I have ran in I definitely recommend buying these shoes

Most cozy shoe I own Hard to pick other options in my arsenal over them now

I really like the design of the UltraBOOST but I think you should start selling a new type of color for these shoes Camoflage I think that the camouflage would look absolutely fantastic on these shoes I also think that this would boost your selling rate of these shoes because people have to go to other websites or people to get these custom made shoes and your losing some business by not having this color I do hope to see this in the future

Very comfortable Wish They were available in half sizes in the larger sizes

I think the color and design are very sharp and creative Very comfortable also

excellent cushion and support can wear with anything definitely will recommend

Adidas really just did it did not they i can barely wear another shoe these made all my other shoes feel like bricks Adidas this is an flawless sneaker as for the price all i have to say is if you are trying to decide on buying just do it you wont regret it

The quality is great and the comfort is amazing The colors are nice and they look good on the foot

Comfort is great on these Worth the money great purchase

It is very easy and comfortable to wear It does not cause pains to your feet therefore it makes walking very easy and comfortable

it is very comfortable One of my favorite running shoes ever

I really like the shoes except for one thing The soles get dirty on the side and they do not come clean at the seams There is no way to avoid this so you end up with shoes that look dirty right away no matter how careful you are Otherwise great shoes for lounging or walking Not for sports but that is ok For me if the shoes are stylish and for walking and also expensive I do not want them looking dirty So unfortunately I can not recommend them

Worth every penny Took a few days to get used to how much more comfortable they were than anything else I have ever had

Well made so comfortable The way it made it shows that the sneaker is so comfortable you can also take a long walk

Excellent shoe very comfortable Slightly narrow though

I was blown away by how good they felt on my feet

I am going to give an in depth review I got the shoes they arrived in good condition Let me say these are the MOST comfortable shoes I have ever worn I have nmds and these fit very different I am an 11 in nmds but in these I need a 12 5 I am going to refund them and are order a 12 5 as these are the most fantastic shoes I have every purchased Definately recommend as the core black looks great Good luck enjoy

I love the product because it is the most comfortable shoes I have ever had

Overall quality and feel is great I love the way they look and would recommend them to anyone

This shoe is very comfortable for all occasions These shoes have been so nice I have bought multiple pairs Well worth the price

do not like because too small plus the quality is not that great

Perfect fit amazing comfort Will definitely buy more of these in the coming future

The shoes are very comfortable and high quality Highly recommend

Really comfortable flexible and supports Hard to find in stores though

I like how comfortable they are Plus they match everything but jeans

The pair I received seems to be defective The bottom is not glued correctly and they came with a tare in the fabric in the front

The insole was dirty out of the box good shoe imo

I love my ultra boost I was a bit skeptical but I can truly say ultra boost is the most comfortable shoe I ever owned True to size and very stylish do not think I can buy anything else

Expensive for shoes but you get what you pay for Definitely worth it

I think it is very comfortable but it scratches way to easily I do not even know how it could have got scratched on the cage and other parts I have only had them for a week and a half Other than that they fit fine

The best feeling shoe I have worn in a while Hands down

Great shoe feels like a runner but in vogue A little expensive but feels like a quality product that will last Anyways if they ever go out of style or get too gross to wear out you can always use them as solid running shoes

The running shoes are light comfortable and durable I would recommend them to anyone

Love it Fits perfectly I would like to buy a second pair

9 9 10 toe caps arent always perfect on ultra boost

This ultra boost colorway is head turning get complements every time I wear them out Only negative about this shoe is that it is more narrow then other 3 0s just wish Adidas was more consistent with sizing

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet

The material feels nice Sole is nice and cushiony Shoe is very fashion forward as well

i like it because it feel like you are walking on clouds

Great shoe very comfortable Have fractured back shoe makes life a little easier

Love it due to the comfort level and style Fits true to size and can be worn with any style pants

Comfortable shoes You can wear it anywhere my friends like them

These tennis shoes are so light weight and very comfortable The size and width was perfect and I am very satisfied

Great shoe and very comfortable but one gripe The adidas stripes and heel cup thing scratch really easily One day in I had a big scuff looking scratch on it Did not make me happy Still though super comfortable and worth the money

Really comfortable Shipped fast with no problems at all

I bought this shoe from an Adidas retailer It was very comfortable and stylish

I have less pain from support of material of the sneaker and sole

Adidas has the best shoes on the market hands down

Had high hopes for the ultra boost but had to return them because size 13 does not fit correctly too small

This product is definitely worth its price Very comfortable

Product was pretty good but I always had trouble with ultra boost they do not last long and are not that durable I will not recommend as a performance sneaker due to it is low durability but as a every day kick it will do that job very well these sneakers are the most comfortable sneaker adidas brand can offer in my opinion and very stylish sneaker I will give it a strong 5 5

Only thing to think about when buying these shoes is they are very easily dirty

Love these sneakers Definitely recommend these sneakers

Okay this a great shoe Normally I have to wear inserts into any shoe I wear This shoe cradles my foot like a glove and provides support so I can walk without foot pain This really is a great shoe I now own two pairs of these shoes

I had to be on my feet for over 15 hours straight For the first time ever my feet were not even sore

Fits well Good grip Being a size 12 5 this actually had good fitting

These shoes have to be one of the most comfortable shoes ever The primaknit feels soft and cushion and much nicer than the mesh on the NMDs The Boost material is great for walking around and provide a comfortable walk Not sure how these would hold up for running since I prefer the sides to be more rigid for that

super comfortable I will buy again please do not make me type so much

I really love the shoe it is like a sock to me but walking on clouds But the one thing I do not like is the ventilation in the shoe

do not let the pictures fool you I got the Tech Gray they are not gray They are basically brown purple

so i like that utraboost because this look so cool

Simple but perfect Like one walking on clouds 5start rating

Most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased great look to it too Great comfort without having to sacrifice the look of the shoe it is awesome

Boost is comfort and great for being on your feet

Look great but too narrow if you have a wide foot

Great support and feels like I am walking on air These shoes are pricy and I do wish they were less expensive However if you have some spare change for these shoes you will like them if you know you will make good use of them

I love adidas I love the boost outsole Love the design of the shoe

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Wear them all day I am a server and my feet never hurt after non stop moving and standing for 12 hours

Initially I was worried about the high price but after using them for a couple weeks now they were worth every penny and more In fact next time I get paid I am considering buying another pair Not only are they the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned but they are also very stylish gotten many compliments on them I would highly recommend These shoes to anyone

Quality fast shipping 100 authentic comfortable basically perfect

I bought a size 9 which is what I wear all the time This particular shoe ran 1 2 a size larger Sold my size 9 to my brother and bought a 8 1 2 Best pair of running shoes I have had

My son wanted these sneakers for back to school senior year We received them pretty quickly after placing the order He tried them on and said they are very comfortable They look great and will go with everything he wears I would recommend these sneaker to anyone looking for comfortMy sons words

So comfortable shoes It feels you have nothing in your feet but comfort Give it a try

You can not top boost and they look great Amazing tech

Booooooooooooooooost Best shoe on the market Fast delivery

Yeah I like ultraboot energy and ultraboot uncaged

Pretty satisfied with them They were a little big for the size but overall really like them

I highly recommend this sneaker

The shoe is very tight and comfortable if you need boost in your life this is the shoe to get

Great shoe fits true to size I skeptical about ordering true size when I seem to wear different sizes in adidas shoes But it worked out great

Super comfortable great everyday shoe I can not run in it as it is not stable enough for me Must be a perfectly neutral runner

Like no shoe I have put on in a good way

I have been a Adidas customer for most of my life and typically go for the higher end of the line as I work out and run quite a bit I recently purchased lease than 1 month the Ultraboost running shoes 4 weeks later the top laceholerbroke on the left shoe and is almost broken on the right The system is exactly the same as my previous Ultraboost runners but what happened to the quality

Shoes look great and are comfortable the only thing is the tip of the outsold looks like it is starting to wear down and I have only had it for 2 weeks also it is a little tight around the adidas cage

Comfortable and has a great look that goes with almost everything Great everyday shoes

Best combination of style and comfort Most balanced shoe I have ever owed

comfort and cushion first pair I purchased 4 months ago fit perfectly this newer version was a full size too small Wear a 11 almost all the time but had to upsize to a 12 The 12 fit perfect so beware if ordering online

If you are a sneakerhead and Ultra Boost lover You must add this shoe to your collection The colorway is great for the fall season Quality primeknit with hits of grey and burgundy dynamic boost and neutral cool smoke grey cage set this shoe apart from previous colorways

Also not psyched about the current color selection which seems to cater to casual wearers and not runners May need to go in a different direction unless new colors come out soon I have neon green and generally prefer brighter colors and combinations

These are the most comfortable shoes I saw them at first and did not buy a pair then one was gifted to me Pretty sure I will exclusively buy Ultraboosts from now on Adidas keep this in stock Also more colors please

It mad good and a mad good purchase and lit it bonya

These trainers are just right and easy on my feet after a long day on my feet they do not hurt no were near as much as my other trainers did And my bunoiness do not not hurt no were near as much with these new trainers thank you

The white version looks very nice They are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned It honestly feels like I am wearing another pair of socks which is a good thing I would definitely recommend them and it is worth every dollar

its comfy and adidas is the way to go comfy and is the best

I will be buying only ultra boost running shoes from now on These shoes feel amazing

Very comfortable shoe with perfect sizing and flexibility 10 10 would recommend

The most stylish and most comfortable sneaker ever worn

Most comfortable shoe I have worn I should not have to write a long review

My son says his menultra boosts are the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn

The product is amazing and exceptional quality I absolutely love these shoes

Adidas ultra boost its the best shoe overall comfortable and quality wise you can not imagine until you wear it So what are you waiting for

The level of comfort is outstanding and it elevates any outfit you have got on assuming you are using this for casual wear and not fitness

The UltraBoost are great Top comfort feel and fit Very light and have a great bounce back Will buy more

Adidas took over the game with this shoe Best shoe ever most comfortable thing I have ever worn

this product is simply the best because it is very comfortable and beautiful

Amazing every day shoes The color really stands out against other ultra boosts

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The triple whites are so fresh and my favorite out of the three pairs I own If you are debating between a few color combinations go with the triple white People keep saying they get dirty easily but there are plenty of sneaker cleaning products on the market that eliminate this problem in a matter of minutes Great shoe

This is my fourth pair of UltraBoost and the consistency in their comfort continues After the second pair I was converted and these are the go to for comfort

This product is comfortable and Easy to wear for men and women

The whole shoe is perfect can not wait to get another pair

One of the most popular shoes for a reason they look great and they are crazy comfortable 10 10

Super comfortable like running on pillows Well made yet light

Looks great when running or go out somewhere Soft on the bottom when walking or running

The shoes are stylish and very comfortable best shoe

I like the ultra boosts because they are very comfortable and they look cool I feel good when I run in them because they are the best running shoes I have had

The upper material began to rip after just one week of normal wear

This shoe is absolutely amazing in every aspect comfort style and the price I am always convincing my friends to cop these

Comfy Simple Ultra

Once you try them on it is love and take it from me I hate adidas with a passion when I was a kid I had a pair fall apart on me told my self never again this is my first pair of adidas cense the year 2000

I like this product because it is everything adidas promised and some

The second you put your feet in these shoes you will not want to go back to any other type They are EXTREMELY comfortablehave incredible support especially in the heel area and just look sexy to be quite honest Whether you are running or walking you can truly notice the shock absorbance of the shoe once your foot impacts the ground This is the first pair of Adidas shoes I have ever bought and I am sold for life if they keep producing shoes with this level of quality and comfort

Comfortable like walking on a cloud and stylish I would recommend this product

The shoes is in good quality Its design is great and the price is just enough

Very comfortable and I already fell in love with shoes

I recent bought my first pair of ultra boost about a month ago I could not be in love with these shoes more They are very stylish and look good with any outfit Also a great shoe to wear to the gym I purchased the triple whites and over time they got very dirty which happens with any pair of all white shoes Because of that and the fact that they are just a great shoe in any category I ordered the black ones and the shipping was very fast and I could not be happier with them I recommend these to everyone I know and once they try them on they are sold

Everything is good but my new shoe has scuffs like this I am sure that it is not my false and i have no idea how they are from I hope that I will have some explaination and advices about that

Amazing shoes I have like 10 pairs Purchased as a gift as well and they love them

Love the comfort feel good on my feet I like hiw light they are and the style hope to swe more of these brands

This is my first pair of ultraboost 3 0 and I have to say that adidas knocked it out of the park with these The color pops and the boost is great all around Plus they actually had my true size of 12 5 and I could not be happier Thank you

If you want a great looking style and running shoe you found it

I like most people was a little skeptical of how a shoe could be priced the way it is Sure it is an investment but from the moment I put them on they were the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Although these shoes are super comfortable I do believe after a long time standing in them they may start to lose their signature comfort a little too soft if that makes sense and also if you have them up tightly they may strain your foot This however should not scare you from buying the shoe the investment was very much worth it The style and supreme comfortability make this my go to shoe for years to come

Feel great look even better I love the positive impact collaboration with parley looking forward to seeing more

The comfort was great but as I wore the shoe the toe area started to care in so there would be massive bumps The bumps would press up into my left foot causing pain

the khaki color is amazing the comfort is amazing do your feet a favor buy some boost ASAP

Good product but ultra boost writing on the heel is already wearing off and I have not even worn the shoes yet And the online picture looks to have more black accents than the shoe actually has which I was disappointed by Overall very comfy and good looking shoe other than these minor flaws

I like the product cause they lit They fit lit They look lit They make me feel lit And all my friends and bruddas say they is lit Sooo wazzzaaaaa it is lit

I do not like and disappointed with the produce like give me a seconsd hand have the pink color on my the shose and the shoes is not look nice as the picture could i retune

I own many ultra boost from the 1 0 to current This colorway is smooth Fusion of comfort and style

Amazing Need a all brown with copper letters for work Brown ultraboost Brown Brown

Must cop for you collection Or even just because you like them

Only shoe I can wear during a 12 hour hospital shift

Awesome product everyone should have these they were comfortable at a great price everyone should get some because these are just plain perfect

The shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned You can tell the shoe is high quality and worth the price

You can not go wrong with a pair of Adidas Ultraboost This particular colorway is perfect as it allows you to wear both light and dark pants sweats etc and match perfectly Highly recommended

Overall amazing shoes I really do not have anything negative to say about them

it is a very nice shoe got no complaints but that I recommend taking out the insole

This shoe is just perfect the minute you put them on it will feel like walking on clouds it feels like putting on a sock Best purchase ever made

Best and most comfortable shoe I have ever worn highly recommend

I wanted black you did not have it so I settled for the black and blue You sent me some sort of turquoise color Thanks What a surprise Disgruntled was taken as a nickname

Ultraboosts are of course one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The 3 0 primeknit pattern is not my favorite at all but in this colorway it looks great to me it is the perfect blend of pink and gray this is better than or what the Reigning Ch and collaboration should have been I am ready to try the 4 0 let us get the triple black model right the first time around

Yes cause it is comfortable to wear and able to tun golf in

I love the shirt and it makes real sense i wish I can get it for free

Love this shoe I use it for lifestyle so i get 1 2 size bigger and there perfect The cargo trace on point CANT WAIT TO COP ANOTHER color wave

If you are looking for a new running shoe and or just a great shoe everyday wear This is by far the best shoe I have ever put on my feet

Great looking but should have sized up compared to 3 0 Boost Had to return

I love my new shoes they are very stylish I love the color too

Super good fit and the colorway is lit The boost was definitely worth the money

The shoes are very comfortable and look good on the feet my only problem with them is that they are a bit expensive

The shoes were really comfortable as expected but I felt the toe area was a little too stretchy which made kinda off unsupportive but the lockdown in the heel made up for it

Fits perfect and extremely comfortable Definitely will be getting more color ways

I found the sneaker I want to wear all day everyday These are by far the most comfortable shoes I own if you do not have a pair you are missing out

The most comfortable shoes on planet earth This shoe made me enjoy walking for hours at my work place

The color way is visually appealing the shoe fits well and it feels as if I am walking on a cloud compared to other tennis shoes I have worn

Would be the perfect shoe aside from the Continental sole that is almost worn through at the ball of my foot in less than a month They were not worn daily or used to run

Shoe is crazy comfortable Must be why I bought 3 pairs already Not dissappointed but feels tighter than other pairs I have bought

IVE BEEN WANTING TO GET A PAIR OF THESE SHOES FOR A WHILE AND MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORNED TOLD ME THEY ARE THE BEST AND THEY ARE THE LOOK THE STYLE THE BUILD AND THE COMFORT HOWEVER IF THERES ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY NEGATIVELY ABOUT THEM IT WOULD BE THAT YOU CAN SEE GLUE ON THE SHOE FROM THE BUILD IN MULTIPLE PARTS AND IN OTHER SHOES IVE SEE I HAVE ALSO NOTICED IT

It is really a great shoe Comfortable perfect fit looks fantastic

I have owned and loved many Adidas shoes over the past 20 years But this new design has an allmesh front half with hard Adidas stripes on the sides Those stripes squeezed my foot Also the laces have been moved lower and so the fit by the ball of the foot no longer can be adjusted with lacing Comfy footbed however I have read the same complaints by others reviewing this shoe

Comfortable and stylish good color boost is the best

Nearly a week into owning these shoes and have put many miles very comfortable

great colorway but for me it runs half size small i compared to a 1 2 size smaller ultraboost multicolor and they are similar length your results may vary

Im 6 2 215 and I live in the city and walk everywhere so comfort is a must and the ultraboosts are just right for that Plus they look amazing Really hoping that I will be able to get the triple black colorway that seem to keep missing the releases by seconds

I was sleeping on UB for a while but finally got a pair and they instantly broke my all time top 5

I am just sad I waited so long to buy a pair They are amazing

Initial impressions great shoe for casual and road running if you like the soft plush feel Soles are pretty soft so will see how long they will last for the next few months

I like the comfort of the shoe Plan on buying more ultra boost soon

Second pair and well worth it Love the color and can not beat boosts with comfort

Love the fit but the heels feels slim The pure boost feels perfect and I expected this to feel similar or better but was a little let down by the just ok feel

My boyfriend has been trying to get me to buy Ultraboost for the longest time I am happy that I waited for the right colorway The boost is super soft to walk on feels like nothing just as they say you are walking on clouds I get a lot of compliments at work from co workers and patients YOU WILL NOT REGRET THE PURCHASE

Will definitely continue to add UB to my growing collection

This shoe is beautiful in person the colors really pop and is definitely an eye catcher kind of a hard colorway to match with but I love it

It is a great shoe very comfortable but a tad but expensive for their wear

Really worth it even if you do not run Most comfortable shoes ever

Nice very cushioned running shoe Some people might find it squishy but at 200 lbs I am glad to have the cushioning that these offer Planning on buying more pairs to have extras

I got these shoes right before San Diego Comic Con I did more than 10 miles of walking and waiting in line each day I would not have made it without these shoes Best shoes for anything that has miles of walking and standing in lines such as amusement parks and conventions

and its color is not too much

These are the most comfortable and best looking shoes I have ever owned

They are good for running and really comfortable

Great shoe super comfortable and light Colorway of this shoe is awesome

Really comfortable and a overall nice shoe Some threads were loose when I received them tho

it is just perfect for an everyday shoe and it is stylish

I own pure boosts and these do not compare to the ultra These shoes feel like they have a recoilafter finishing your step it feels like a spring launches you forward

Runs 1 2 size too small Maybe it fill better once broken in to Also no arch support for my flat feet Overall Im satisfied with the purchase

The shoe is very comfortable and I just love the boost on the shoe itself

Been a loyal consumer of adidas especially the boost technology Must confess that I own over 30 pairs ranging from the original 1 0 to the latest release One complaint that I have and it is HUGE the soles rip Yes they rip in had even with the new continental bottoms Every pair I own has ripped and it is very unfortunate I run approx 10 15 miles a week treadmill and paved roads The tear begins at around the 4 6 month mark Absolutely love the shoes but beware of this Please fix

Very comfy and nice quality Perfect shoes can not wait for the Triple Gray

Been waiting on this drop for close to a year since the release of the CNY UltraBoosts dropped They are exactly what I have been waiting for

My first Ultra boost definite worth every pennies The shoes is comfortable and fit perfectly This multicolor UB awesome If you can pick up one asap

Perfect fit and and a great balance of color for the shoe

I think this is the best model made My only complaint is that when the shoe is on the tongue patch was made a little smaller compared to other iterations of the shoe so it fits a little tighter at the collar but is easily solved by loosening the laces

All adidas shoes have their own sizing to it which is annoying for new buyers I tried to research how ultraboosts fit but could not find a definite answer

Amazing shoe Definitely one of the most comfortable and stylish shoes ive ever worn I would say they are worth the price Big fan of adidas

Great comfortable shoe Have not had a chance to run in the shoes but for casual wear they are great

Absolutely love the Ultra Boost and this colorway is amazing

The ultra boost silloette is my favorite The prime knit is so comfortable and the color way of the shoe is great

Did not regret buying it at all Enjoy walking in it

Quite expensive but these days this what you pay for it otherwise excellent product

Loved this colorway the first time I saw it The inconsistencies with Adidas sizing is super annoying especially with these hard to get releases

One of the most comfortable shoes i have Also the multi color looks alot better in person The colors really pop

These shoes are a little pricey but they are very comfortable

When the new 3 0s came out I went with my TTS which is a 10 I bought the zebras as my first pair of 3 0s I bought the multicolor And they have seemed to revert back to the older sizing of the 1 0 and 2 0 which is 1 2 size up from TTS These are too small and I will have to return them

Best shoes out right now but to me it is more of a casual shoe than a performance shoe

This is my comfiest shoe ever Love the color as well

I love Boost period You will never find a more comfortable shoe

Best colorway Love that these will go with everything

Easily the most comfortable shoe on the market Really amazing and bold colorway

Great running shoes Great all day shoes Everyone loves me only when I wear them

Awesome color love the mainly black look but why an LTDI do not see anything premium about the shoe besides the color Anywho best 3 0 colorway by far

My wife loves these shoes Bought for her as a surprise and she told me these are her new fav gym shoes

it is like walking on clouds You can never go wrong with Boost

I got this at 3am and I scored a size 6 Proud pickup besides the OG

the comfort is on point Nice colorway for a LTD and this specific shoes is lil tighter than pre ones and TTS on my feet Should go half or one size up with wide feet

Comfortable breathable upper would recommend to anyone

The best 3 0 colorway Comfort is always on point Would and have recommend this shoe to everyone

This product looks better in person Best Boost yet I do not know why it is limited addition though Also the sizing is a little off So I had to go true to size rather than 5 down like I normally do

I have a ton of Ultra Boost shoes and keep buying more because they fit so well and are super comfy

Its good that Ultraboost got some colorful conbinations I wish you get more of this and not the old plain colorways

It offers amazing comfortability and breathability for your feet

Great colorway Very comfortable and quality is on point

one of my favorite shoes very comfortable and great color detail

I like the comfort sizing and how the multicolor turned out Is exactly what I envisioned when I purchased them

Comfy show and by way the best Colorway of the Ultra Boost 3 0

The comfort and style behind this shoe is incredible

This colorway truly stands out definitely my new favorite shoe

best looking most comfortable lifestyle running shoe available

One of the most comfortable shoes I have purchased Highly recommend

Incredibly comfortable and stylish You definitely get what you paid for with these shoes Everyday shoes or statement shoes you decide You can not go wrong with either

Comfy and stylish I usually only get white and black sneakers so it was nice to get some color into my collection

it is ultraboost It is comfy and I just need to fill in the characters

Great show Fits like every other ultra boost The trace pink is so much nicer in person Great shoe to talk around in at work and a real joy to run in

These are comfortable but not for serious running as they are not very supportive

The blue in the pic does not match the actual shoe very off and the size was off by 1 2

Obviously ultra Boost are extremely comfortable I am a huge fan of this colorway Trace Pink

Very unique and comfortable I like how the boost technology was created

 xc3 xbaper confortable shoes I like that is just one piece

This is honestly the best shoe I have ever had The Prime Knit is super comfortable and the boost gives me the spring and comfort I need Never leaving the boost line

Fita bit tight and because of that the comfort is not as good as it could be

I only run in these they are my favorite out of my 3 runner they feel amazing top to bottom prime knit upper feel great the cage really locks you in the Boost is spongy feels better the faster you run the only complaint is the soles have a lot of ware and I only got about 50 miles on them do not think they will make it to 150 for the price they should last 300 or 400 miles min

love the product but they need to make more colors and a little bit more Hip little nerdy but the most comfortable shoes i have bought Have bad feet and this shoe is GREAT on comfort

Its so comfy and fits so perfectly to the footlt 3

I like it it is really comfy I recommend this to anyone who can afford it

The ultra boost 3 0 is made of a stretchier knit material than the 2 0 I had to get used to it at first but after a couple of times wearing it I became accustomed to the feel If you are looking for a comfortable sneaker that looks good with jeans and shorts then the ultra boost if definitely the shoe for you

There are not many sneakers that come even close to the overall comfort and quality of Ultraboost Hands down my favorite sneaker

Great shoe comfy but a little pricey But like most things you pay for what you get

Without a doubt the most comfortable Ultra Boost in my opinion The way the knit just sits on top of your feet makes it extremely comfortable The boost cushioning feels like you are walking on clouds

Very comfortable footwear quality is worth the money whether running or just simply to walk around this is the sneaker you want on your feet Adidas is ahead of the competition with these

Best purchase ever the most comfortable shoes ever best colorway ever

most comfortable shoe I have ever worn llllllllllllll

The best comfortable shoes Adidas has come out with

Comfort is on point and the colorway is great in person

Narrow for my wide foot but best shoe for a long walk for the bounce I get from each step

fashion plus comfort Just what I am looking for

Fits your foot with almost sock like feel Unparalleled cushion in the heels great shoe Not to mention the styles

Great shoe and I love the cushioning They run a little small for me I have to wear one size up Hopefully one day we can get a lighter ultraboost as well

Super light and amazing comfort

Great running shoes Super comfortable Cant wait to use for my first half marathon

These are just as comfortable as my last pair no big surprise there

Love the product Comfortable cool and classy Do it for the culture Do your feet a favor and get some ultra boost ASAP

My first ultraboost was the Chinese New Year and I fell in love Wanted these ones since previews with the translucent cage started showing up on the internet The details on this shoe are absolutely amazing Pictures do not do it justice

Depending on how your preference on fit you may want a size 1 2 smaller than your usual if you want that snug fit Primeknit material is awesome

Great pair of shoes So comfy I am glad I was able to get them

Love these shoes I have several pairs of ultraboost But I love the look of these shoes can not wait to see what Adidas comes up with next

A bit tighter than the other Ultraboosts Looks great

I like these shoes because of the look and the meaning behind them We need to save our oceans and this is a step in the right direction I hope to see more from parley in the future

These ultraboost colorway is insane and it is definitely a head turner Primeknit on these third iteration is more giving than the two predecessors My only complain is inconsistency on the fit The knit on the first runs of colorways are more stretchy than later releases but regardless it do not hurt my feet I guess adidas still can not resolve their inconsistencies on sizing and fit Nonetheless BOOST is always LIFE

I own a pair of the NMD City Sock and it is a nice shoe and it wears fairly comfortably I was highly skeptical of the hype around the Ultraboost and boy was I wrong These are THE most comfortable pair of sneakers that I have owned I recently purchased a pair of Vapormaxand ended up returning them because of how uncomfortable they fit The Ultraboost beats it hands down

The best color shoe in the sneaker game I would have bought two if they had not sold out so fast

can not go wrong with ultra boost The multicolor add another level of awesomeness

I love the multi color However the fit at the heel ankle area is strange it is very narrow and tight when you first put them on and I have noticed throughout the day it can start to hurt your foot if youre not constantly walking I have multiple 3 0 color ways and for some reason the multi color was difficult to put on I went half size up because people were saying it was more snug 10 5 was perfect but I could do 10 if I want that lockdown tight fit With other solid 3 0 colors the shoe slides right on With these you need to definitely use the heel tab I am assuming they are more thick do the PK having so many colors Nonetheless the shoe is great and I love it

Love the color the look feel and fit They are a perfect fit for me

The color and comfort of these pairs are out of this world Could not ask for anything else

Sneaker is so comfy I recommend this sneaker for runners or for walking around all day Ex Theme parks

Which traction was more durable Other than that shoe is on point All day wear Work Gym

The shoes were a bit smushed upon arrival I have a wider foot so the shoes felt about 1 4 size too small Overall still comfortable

I went 0 5 size up from TTS and the fit is perfect The colorway looks great and goes well with a lot of outfits and is perfect for the summer My pair arrived with a excess amount of glue stains on the sides of the UltraBoost badgehowever the shoe is very comfortable and great to look at overall

Best shoe Very comfortable and the colorway is amazing

yes the multicolor ultra boost are amazing most comfy shoe ever

Beaides the design and color shoes are very comfortable

It was an amazing purchase with amazing quality from the Adidas brand as usual

This shoe is super comfortable instantly out of the box They are the best Adidas shoes I highly recommend them for casual wear or to run in them

Everything about the design of this shoe is perfect and it is easily my favorite Ultra Boost yet However it really irks me that the upper is far tighter than any previous UB Definitely order 1 2 up

Got two pairs of the 3 0 The mystery grey and the multi colors And I have to say the multi colors fit a tad more snug Aside with the minor sizing issue These shoes are stylish and super comfortable I got 6 pairs total of various ultraboost models and counting

Dope shoe Looks much brighter than the picture Super comfortable

These shoes are the best looking and most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned They run a little small so I recommend going a 1 2 size up Definitely worth waking up early to cop a pair of these

This is one of my favorite colorway of the 3 0 UB Great comfortable fit as always

this was my first 3 0 ultra boost owned a few pairs of the 2 0 the Ultra Boost is hands down one of the most comfortable shoes ever once this multicolor version of the 3 0 came out much better than the 2 0 multi pattern do not know why they used an ugly red heel cup for that one I knew I had to get these but once I received them there was glue all over the knit around the heel cup horrible quality you could see and feel the white shoe glue all over the soft knit returning these

Love it and not a big fan of 3 0 pattern but this colorway is great

The bossy technology is A1 and super comfortable for my feet

I love ultraboosts As simple as that super comfy great classic look These go with literally anything I can throw at them I hope they make a mid in this color too Hint hint adidas

Besides being the most comfortable shoes on the planet the multicolor is stunning and will become an absolute classic for collectors

These shoes are so comfortable They feel like therapeutic pillows for your feet plus feel great on the ankles Very easy on the knees while being active You can wear them tied or casually untied and they still fit well The construction design improves with every model and the colorways are sweet

do not know why this colorway run small Compared too my other ultra boost it runs at least a size smaller Very disappointed

Its the most comfortable shoe i own and they style can go with anything

The photo does not do it justice In hand these are really aesthetic

Light and comfortable plus quality is outstanding

Best Looking UB out there I love the multicolor look

The quality of the materials coupled with the unique color way make this product exceptional

Easily the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I waited all year for this specific silhouette to release

I love then and now I want to own all the different colours

I can walk all day in these shoes and not have my feet hurt

Quality and comfort on this model is amazing Keep up the good work Adidas

One of the best colorway to be released for the 3 0 ultra boost Shoes comfortable to walk in and length is good BUT the width is way too small and cuts off circulation if I am not constantly moving I can barely get my foot into the opening of the shoe it is so tight

Everyone knows the UB line is awesome No need to get into detail Great shoe super comfy and these khaki colorway is fire dawg

Most comfortable shoe by far Colors and design is just simply beautiful

They are very comfortable and I like the color of them

Love the ultra boost Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

These are the most comfortable shoes ever and they look great

For some reason the right shoe is slightly smaller than the left

Best sneakrr ever comfort second to none i will buy ultra noost here on out

Definitely get a 1 2 size smaller I am so disappointed that I am unable to wear there considering that these are in limited quantity

very conformable shoe but needs to be wider shoe

Colors on the knit pattern are actually more vibrant and brighter than the pictures would make you asssume

The Ultraboost still the best running shoe in the market

Love how the primeknit feels The boost is on point

Took a little bit but got them and they shipped fast I love them

Comfort and style The multicolor is unique and as always boost is always a1 in comfort

Yes only thing about the sizing for women You should go down a size and a half I wear 7 5 in womenand 6 in menThe menshoe perfectly lines up with my womenshoe

My first ultra boost pair and will never bye any other shoe from now on The most comfortable show I have own

Great looking comfortable shoe This is one of the best ultra boost color ways

The Adidas UltraBOOST is the most comfortable shoe

Ultra Boost is the most comfortable shoe on the market

Looks great and it is very comfortable they mesh however is very delicate it could rip very easily

there is nothing not to like about UltraBoosts Comfort story and function all combine perfectly together

Very comfortable extremely clean show great sizing

They are like walking on clouds and sunshine Boost is the way to go

The ultra Boost is the ultimate running shoe I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone

great buy but have to return it size was off so mad

Love how comfortable these shoes are and how stylish they can be as well

Incredibly comfortable and very appealing to the eye

This comfort on this shoe is amazing and the quality and colors are great

Most comfortable shoe I own I own 6 pair of Ultra Boost and looking forward to more

The perfect mix of athletic and casual sneaker I would not wear any other shoe besides an Adidas Ultraboost

Subtle color way of an phenomenal running shoeminimalmovement

A very comfortable shoe light weight and can be worn all day

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and they look phenomenal I have wide feet so they are a little narrow but it does not affect the comfort of the shoe

Began to fray after 2 weeks with minimal use very disappointed with this

Love the shoe but I have the all white ultra boost 3 0 in the same size and this one runs smaller

I love these shoe3 pairs and I have never regretted putting them on in the morning If you was not the comfiest shoes in the game cop a pair of ultra boost

Really nice the primenit is soft and the boost is boosty

Love ultraboosts and anything boost for that matter

So bummed Got these right away before they sold out I have had many pairs of the ultra boosts before These were a 1 2 to a whole size bigger can not even exchange them cause they are sold out now

Adidas boost will always be the most comfortable

For those of you who do not own a pair of ultra boostsit feels like you are constantly walking on a marshmallow The shoe runs 1 2 a size small but if you take the in sole out it fits perfectly

comfort and style all in 1 package the ultra boost caged and uncaged are the best kicks out there but these multicolor are pure fire

These shoes are beautiful They look even nicer once they are on your feet Very comfortable and stylish

It is the most comfortable I have ever warn But I wish it was designed a little bit less bulky

Great shoe very comfortable and stylish I would definitely recommend these

Great concept for saving the oceans and same comfort

Had to take out insole but other than that perfect

Love it Would by more in different colors Primknit is far advanced then anything else

The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The fit is perfect and the style fit with any outfit

The color is Fantastic and Extremely Comfortable

They are very comfortable and good quality shoes They also stay pretty clean for being white

Very happy with my purchase Took me long enough because they did not have my size

Great knit upper that provides breathable sock like fit plus boost mid sole providing marvelous cushion And they look great too

Absolutely love this colorway Other than the 93 17 eqt ultraboost still un rivaled in comfort My only issue is that sometimes the manufacturing of the shoe is poor When mine arrived they had glue on the stripes and part of the metallic on the word ultraboost on the heel cup was chipped or came off when you spend 190 for some sneakers you would expect them to be flawless And then the option of returning them does not make sense because you sell out in my size so all I can get is a refund rather than a new pair so I just end up keeping them even though they arrived partially flawed Still my favorite brand by miles though

As a man who cares about comfort and style these are a must have for anyone sneakerhead or not Boost makes walking a breeze and the primeknit is just icing on the cake

Amazing Hands down the most comfortable shoe I own I am a sneaker head so I had to see what the hype was about To my surprise these shoes live up to the hype I want more already I need more

Great looking comfortable shoes Great support and traction Very true to size so order your actual size

Boost is life brah My first pair of adidas shoes that had boost were a pair of Black Duck Camo NMD XR1a few weeks ago Once I tried them on I was instantly in love and I needed to buy more boost Fast forward to last Friday I was at the mall trying on my first pair of Ultra Boost and they completely ruined my perception of comfort for all other shoes I did not want to leave the store it was so comfortable I knew I had to cop a pair of ultraboosts I had wanted to for a long long time but then I saw the Multicolorand I HAD to cop They should come in 2 days from now and I can not wait to flex in them Thank you Adidas you are the plug xoxo

I already own a pair of Ultra Boostand this color way is a great addition

The comfort and the colorway easily makes for this to be a Classic

This was my first time buying a pair of ultraboost and I have to say they are my most comfortable shoe I highly recommend

Best running shoes period Light weight ideal for running

shoes fit perfectly and feel as if I am walking on clouds

Loved them except for they were half a size to small

it is tighter than other 3 0 but still comfortable

Great fit and comfort I would recommend this color way

Love ultraboost comfortable Goes with any outfit

My 1st pair of UltraBOOST sneakers and I LOVE them

Ultraboost never let you down Always improving the product

These shoes look way better in person If you like blue this color way is fantastic I would buy another pair if they become available again They are great shoes You have to buy them

I love these shoes The color is very vibrant and looks very high tech If you want to use this show for running it will never let you down

First of all the shoe looks amazing And it performs even better Also the fact that they used recycled plastic bottles left on the beaches is a huge plus for me I am really big on having a clean planet The only con I have with the shoe all be it it is a small one it is that it took me a couple of hours to break the shoe in

I actually think out of ultra boost 3 0 this ones fit like they should more in par with the 1st and 2nd version To me they fit perfect because most ultra boost 3 0 they fir larger than usual so if you like how the previous versions fit you would like this one

I really like the design of the shoes starting to wear this shoe makes me not wear other shoes

I absolutely love these shoes I wear them almost everyday They are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn The only issue I have is that the lace hole on the cage ripped Now they are unwearable I am very disappointed because I only wore them for a couple months and took fairly good care of them

Great looking shoes that are extremely comfortable

I am surprised with the comfort and cushioning it offers I ordered based on reviews and needless to say that I am pleased with my decision Initially I thought there is a problem as the lower sole extends a bit outsize the shoe but then all the other official pictures were the same

Very comfy and stylish does run a half size big

Amazing comfort

These shoes grab the attention of my friends everytime I wear them I originally bought them for running but have switched their usage to be casual Work has never been so comfortable

This is my first pair of Adidas Ultra boost I got the khaki they are awesome very comfortable at first I thought it was all hype it turns out to be these and got to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I definitely will be buying more thanks Adidas I am a new fan

I have enjoyed my Ultra Boost 2 0s and was excited to replace them with a pair of Ultra Boost 3 0s after I would worn them out running Unfortunately the pair of 3 0s seems to have slightly different sizing Specifically the 3 0s seem to be a half size larger than my previous pair making the fit noticeably worse when exercising and running

Insanely comfortable Like walking on a cloud Absolutely love them

They fit half size small Slightly narrow wish they would have said that

I love those shoes Very light I have very wide foot but the material its soft and stretches

Best running shoe in the game Feels like I am running on clouds

Size runs 1 2 smaller than other boosts Shoe looks good but hard to decide if the shoes are comfortable if sizing is not consistent especially if you can only order one shoe at a time

The Silver Bliss on the sole and pk gives this ub a different pop Get mad stares on the street

The most comfortable Adidas shoes I have ever worn

Superior Cushioning These shoes are pretty much the most comfortable shoes I have ever run in

I love this shoe because it is leather caging and cmon adidas make them all leather a little scared paying this much for a shoe but if you find the leather ones be true to size and get them they are worth it

The materials are great and the shoe is very comfortable

I have NMDs as well The Ultraboost is more comfortable has more support and partnering with Parley was a huge deal for me

This shoe was too narrow for me and I have a medium width foot My foot spills over the side and my pinky toes feel pinched I tried going up half a size but it did not help The shoe looks great and I can tell it would be comfortable if they widened it some Hopefully new versions will be wider because I really wanted to wear this shoe

Love them Best shoes ever WIsh I could have every color out there

The fit was a bit more snug compared to my other UB 3 0s but it was not tight it was just right

Feels like walking on marshmallows or the moon even

Go 1 2 size UPPPPP The material on these are different and I think it makes it more narrow and tight around your feet

Any and all ultra boosts are great This one is just a bit smaller and tighter fitting than most so go up a half size at least Plus the loop on the front could have been a bit more subtle One of the best looking ultras by far though

I love the shoes and concept behind it but I do not see the 20 dollars increase in price Go half a size up mine was tts and was too small

Are one of the most comfortable shoes I have True to size for this boost felt a little snug but still feels nice

Very light and good prime knit always wanted 2 0 it is great shies

Was too small had to return it Go 5 up your regular size I think the recycled plastic gives it a tighter fit

Ultra boost is amazing Wish they had size 13 though Great shoe and meaning behind the shoe

Very comfy recommend to half size up on 2 0s though

Great shoes recycling plastic from the ocean an A

Great shoe FatherDay gift Dad really likes them

Ultra boost is life Great color way and great cause

Good very comfortable but the material is cheep and rips

Great pair of shoes that are one of the most comfortable sneakers around Only gripe I have is that the caged fit makes the width feel a bit narrow compared to other shoes If you have wider feet I would recommend sizing 5 up Otherwise great looking shoe

Very light weight comfortable and fit can not wait to actually run in them

These shoes are very comfortable However the material snags easily

Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever walked in I loved the colorway It was perfect for me

I love the feel of this shoe So light and so comfortable

This is my first pair of ULTRABOOST shoes Came highly recommended from friends I am an avid runner and this shoe is definitely on par with other high quality running shoes They are a tight fit had to exchange for a half size larger Love the Parley design You would never guess that they are made from recycled materials Great shoe overall

One of the most comfortable shoes ever could wear these all day

comfort and style mixed perfectly into a great pair of sneakers

Nice color and Quality did not end up keeping however Slightly tight in the toe box would recommend a half size larger

I love this shoe it is so dope I have many other UB in different colorwayssilver blue red I also have the uncaged version in white dye and burgundy I am planning to cop the multi purpose and triple black when it drop this coming Wednesday I can not wait to rock all of them

Go up half a size and these are the best Ultra Boost 3 0s so far This is not a light statement so I would have to defend it I will start with fit A lot of people complain about the tight fit and so do I my true size fits too snug But going up half a size will result in not only a very comfy fit but a better one than regular UB 3 0s The regular Primeknit is just too stretchy that there is pretty much zero containment or support The Parley Primeknit on the other hand is a bit less stretchy still crazy comfy though and more supportive Let me put it this waythe up half a size Parley UB still fits more snug than true size UB in a good way I feel significantly more comfortable wearing these all day compared to my regular UB 3 0

Best I ever had and they said my review was to short so best I ever had

Ultraboost is super comfortable and you save the ocean

Most comfortable shoes ever Would recommend to all my friends

The comfort is awesome Easy to wear light weight

Good quality control awesome concept love the idea Adidas

These shoes are so comfortable and sexy If you are debating whether to get them or not get them

This is my 3rd pair of boost sneakers They are rly decent for running

Had to ship it back Waste of time Way too small

Best shoe I have ever had So so comfortable Blows every shoe out of the water

I like this product because of the way the shoe hugs your feet And every time you walk it feels like your on a pillow

These shoes are thee most comfortable shoes that I have ever put on This shoe is in a class of its own But it better be because of the price I paid for them

Great Shoe Love the color way and matte coloring on heel cup The leather cage really makes the shoe Should be considered LTD given the quality One of my fav ultra boosts

nice summer shoe premium pk and boost sole is comfortable 3 0 runs a bit large would recommend going half a size down vs 1 0 and 2 0were pretty tts

I have 4 pairs of the previous Ultra Boostand the new design for the 3 0definitely feels like they have listened to feedback from the consumer and have improved the prime knit on these shoes After a while my toes would start to go numb in the 2 0and I have not had that issue with the 3 0there is flex where it is needed and support where it belongs Definitely a huge improvement

best shoe out in the market defiantly a must buy

The most comfortable shoe I have ever had The fit and cushion is truly amazing

I never write reviews for anything but these shoes warranted me to voice my opinion These shoes are miles ahead of every other shoe I have worn By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn in my life They grip every part of your foot nice and snugly while still maintaining breathablilty

Ultra boost always good always boost me up

Excellent sneaker boost alday comfort and style adidas killing it

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Thanks

Boi you better buy this shoe Is is so good an comfortable

The boost is very comfy and forms to your foot and reduces impact giving you more to run farther with less effort

Best shoe that I have ever purchased I only wear ultra boost running shoes If I could recommend anything it would be that Adidas make more ultra available Absolutely love the shoes

Comfortable and well made shoe I would recommend getting

These shoes are made of yarn and will make your feet sweat like nothing you have ever experienced in life Howeverthey are the most comfortable things you will EVER put on your feet hands down it is like a slice of heaven My hubby bought me some I bought more But they are made of yarn They smell terrible I mean they really stink Sweat in them one time Better yet two but they feel AMAZING

Great shoe nothing else out there like Boost technology Primeknit on these is top quality too bad they are sold out for everyone else

Comfortable shoe for not one good reason I thought the nmdwere comfortable but when you step in these it is something else Go true to size for the 3 0do not listen to anyone else saying otherwise

This shoe has excellent craftsmanship and great confort

Man these shoes are the best So dang comfortable I used to wear skate shoes and when i got into my 30s my feet just had enough I would always have achy feet and my buddy told me to give UltraBoosts a shot Within 3 months I have 5 different pairs Now I just need some UltraBoost dress shoes for fancy ocassions too

The PrimeKnit upper is unbelievably comfortable The Boost is extremely comfortable It is like i have socks on and walking on pillows all day long Love them

Comfortable shoe but the stitching around the ankle can be better

Shoe for me runs a half size bigger so need thicker socks so shoes do not slip off

After hearing about the Ultra Boost buying a pair of NMD R1 and nMD R2 I finally decided to purchase my first pair The comfort level puts both of the NMDto shame Although the NMDdoes the same to most other shoes on the market The R2Primeknit is more flexible and breathable But everything else goes to the Ultra Boost Fit bounce and overall comfort I would DEFINITELY buy another pair

it is super comfy by far the best comfort shoe I have ever had

it is a perfect fit it is comfortable They look slick they light

I love these shoes because their comfortable and stylish at the same time

Super comfy and its the one shoe that doesnt make my feet hurt after walking around so much

Love it Looks cool with that black sole and feels so comfortable although it is a little bit pricey

Very Comfortable and sharp looking I will not buy any shoe that does not have boost

The ultraboost is worth the price pint as it is one pof the most comfortable and durable shoes I have ever owned

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned Will be sticking to this brand

Great color Fit true to size Will recommend if you can find it

Best Comfortable Shoes Ever and Good Looking shoes

Feels like walking in clouds Looks great with jeans too

Best sneaker I have ever had the pleasure of wearing both for everyday comfort as well as for running Best looking sneaker I have ever seen Cannot wait for an additional pair Great job Great technology Exceptional design Keenup the innovation and all of your success

The shoes are just amazing can walk all day and have no complaints

I like this product because of just how comfortable is it 100

Great shoe The design style and comfort make it 10 10

I love the ultra boosts are not no other shoes is compared to this NASA space shoes

I went from the ultraboost 1 0 to this 3 0 ultraboost and it is great

This what a black UB should look like all I need is a blacked out Boost with that awesome leather cage None the least is an UB And they are all dope

For me personally I wish they were just a little wider Or came in a Wide I had to get them a hakf size bigger for the width to fit right which made them just a little too long but still comfortable

Literally has revolutionized the Shoe industry Ultraboost is the profound shoe of comfort for style or athletics

The shoe is already pulling apart in the seams look like poor quality and workmanship

The energy red I bought before were far better than the Navy Blue The knitted was way more comfortable and the shoe itself overall till someone stole it from infront if my house The Navy blue do not seem to have the same quality

Very nice shoe it was a nice colorway and it was very comfortable

Ultra Boosts are not only comfortable but stylish

Like walking on clouds Very stylish and functional

Black boost enough said Comfort and style in one

Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn I would recommend this to anyone

Best shoe I ever purchased They are so comfortable

I absolutely love these shoes I was not a believer at first but after finally saving up and getting a pair it was one of the best shoe decisions of my life Before I had to use Superfeet Insoles so my feet did not hurt after standing all day but these shoes have made me feel great without having to get extra insoles Only thing I feel bad about is that I am neglecting my other shoes now

Black and white is a classic and must have The leather cage gives it a great look

These are the best shoes out right now I do not know another comfortable shoe

Great multi purpose shoe that goes with any outfit

Most comfortable shoe that I have ever purchased in my life

These shoes are the best shoes I have ever worn was slightly upset with the price at first but after wearing them it was worth it

Ultra boost is the most comfortable sneaker to date I think its a must cop when adidas drops colored boost comfey and looks fresh

The overall build quality and comfort level is amazing For someone who stands on his feet most of the day comfort is key

The shoe is very comfortable not so great with lateral movement

Boost is life Run a half size big Feel great on them feet 

love the comfort all around my feet perfect everyday shoes

This is probably the best shoe adidas has ever made

Comfortable fit but glue in toe created discoloration almost immediately It was quite a bummer on an all white shoe

Most comfortable shoe ever worn The first editions were the best in my opinion but the ultraboost and boost lines by adidas kill the game

Honestly the most comfortable kicks i have ever rocked

Great cushion and comfort all day long I bought them for comfort not a sneaker head

Beautiful design and very comfortable Will purchase other colour for my favourite collection

The ptimeknit falls apart too easily And seems like their is no support

I usually wear size 10 but I would go down to 9 5 for a perfect fit otherwise they are one of most comfortable shoes I own

Very comfy and stylish would recommend for anyone looking for a comfy shoe

5 stars hands down ultra boost is the best for comfort

Amazing ultra boost wish they made more colors at the same time

I love the product best purchase I ever made

The best shoes ever Been using them for a month now the best shoes EVER

The Adidas Ultra Boost is very comfortable it is a very stylish running shoe that is perfect for anyone

do not like the fit of the new UBWhy try to reinvent the wheel1st and 2nd gen fit so much better and looked so much better

I can not say I would go 5 size up but depending on the socks you wear you might find your toe rubbing against the toe of the shoe

Most comfortable shoe ever And the midsole was easy to blackout for the triple black look

Extremely comfortable shoes I walk a lot at work and most shoes would leave your feet tired but these shoes are super comfortable

The Shoe is awesome looking Matches anything I wear

most comfortable shoes i own Boost is like walking on clouds

Slept on colorway Perfect shoe for everyday streetwear

everything is perfect except I prefer the upper mesh to be more like the ultra boost 1 and 2 The mesh on the 3s are too thin

This is one of the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

As with all UBS super comfortable durable one of best color ways love these shoes for tts

Very stylish shoes that are extremely comfortable Require a lot of care to stay white and shiny however

Although price is high great comfort I wish I can afford all colors

Nice fabric and all great idea too But the way they altered the sizing was poor Definitely have to go up a half size or more I didnt even bother trying for those light blues over the size being off for the regular blue ones

I really like the comfort on these shoes I like how it fits to size and it does not squeeze my wide feet

By far the most comfortable shoes I have owned in my life time Best shoes in the world

Boost is always the way to go Never have I worn a more comfortable shoe

These shoes were for my grandson He loves them They are just perfet

Very comfortable The sides run a bit narrow so if you have wide feet go half a size up Light weight Good material good build I still thought it was a bit pricey for what it is but it is still great So far the shoes are still intact no tear or hole

The boost is super soft through out the shoe though I would say the eqt boost has more boost probably adidassecond most comfy shoe

Most comfortable shoe ever can not go wrong with these

These 3 0are super comfortable and the leather cage is an added bonus to the quality of this already great product

This colorway is great and even better on foot a must cop

Amazing comfort Feels like I am wearing pillows on my feet Amazing support

I love the core black colorway it is simple and yet so wonderful True to size for sure

These shoes are like walking on air Definitely recommend you buy them

Wish these were cheaper to buy because I would own multiple pairs

You cannot go wrong with an ultraboost purchase Simply the most comfortable shoe on the market and they have helped my back problems immensely

As others have stated these shoes are super comfy however they have pretty much no support Not that I bought them for their support but it literally feels like a sock on a bed of super soft foam which is great for just everyday stuff I also have a pair of Energy Boost and although not as comfortable they offer the support needed for cross training I wear the Ultra Boost when I go out and about and put on the Energy Boost when it is time to get down to business

That my favorite line of shoes and I will continue to buy them

Most comfortable shoe I ever wore Was a Jordan guy but not anymore BOOST all day

It feels as if i am Walking on clouds Maximum comfort

The most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever owned

Comfy and they look awesome Would recommend this to anyone who wants comfortable shoes that could be worn casually at the same time

Very comfortable and light Best sneakers I ever had Wish there are more colors Highly recommended

About 6 months ago I had a herniated disc and it required surgery This condition left me with nerve damage down my right leg In order for me to drive and or walk normally I had to wear a brach in my shoe because most shoes are too heavy for me to lift with my foot because my foot has minimal strength Now the ultra boost is too small for the brace But what I found out with the ultra boost I do not need the brace anymore The shoe has changed my life I do not have to wear a brace anymore I can drive normal and I can walk longer distances than before I have worn these shoes everyday since because with my condition wearing the brace was exhausting Now with the Ultra Boost I have truly have endless energy

The primeknit fits like a sock and the boost is just amazing

I love everything about UltraBoost from the Appearance all the way down to the Comfort You will definitely be pleased I already can not wait for my other shipment to come in

Absolutely the best white Ultra Boosts to date Love them

Amazing shoe for almost everyday use Would wear everyday beside when it rains

Looks good with everything recommend this shoe to everyone

Shoes are incredibly light and comfortable but within one hour of regular use of wearing them they were snagged Material is very flimsy and super easy to snag resulting in a shabby looking pair of very expensive shoes

Very good materials and feels great on the foot A little pricey but I think it is worth it

My husband

Ultra Boost are the most comfortable sneakers ever so I got my mom a pair and she loves it Style wise though I like the UB 1 0 and 2 0 better because the knit pattern is better and I prefer the solid cage rather than the translucent cage on the 3 0

Love the comfort of these shoes I started with the pureboost and decided to try ultraboost Definitely not disappointed

I usually wear a 10 5 to 11 but all they had was a 11 5 in stock and it turned out to be perfect Overall this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever wore

Great sneakers great quality never felt great comfort

Great shoes Sometimes extremely hard to find in stock

Extremely comfortable yet snug Icy look Love the contrast in whites throughout

These shoes are very comfortable and very stylish

Everything was amazing Wish price was a little lower

The width on these shoes is slightl different than the uncaged version but equally as comfortable

Really comfortable and a great looking shoe It fits true to size for me which was 1 2 size smaller vs boost 2 0

This shoe is very comfortable Great for styling and running

Love the UltraBoost and the way the cage is made on this styler rather than the others

Comfortable

These are by far the Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

This was a great fathers gift for my dad he loves them

you can not go wrong wearing these shoes very comfortable

Bought these shoes for my husband and he loves Ultraboost Great running shoes Five stars all the way xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f

Poorly made will never buy again they are good for comfort only not for running

Super nice shoe really comfy and a classic in the making My 3rd boost shoe and I really like the 2 0 version over the 3 0 hopefully adidas restocks some 1 0s

The Boost technology is superb Super comfy shoes

Very comfortable and go well with most of my clothing

Extremely comfortable and they look even better on feet

I use it for work and my feet are not tired at the end of the day after walking 22k steps

great

Most comfortable shoes I have owned Lightweight and good shock protection soles

This is my first pair of Ultra boost shoes The comfort level is high and they look good too In terms of sizing I wear 8 5 for the new pureboost and NMD pk so I ordered an 8 5 for this shoe The length is perfect but width is a bit tight I have wide feet so you may want to consider going half size up Alternatively you can take the insole out to give yourself more room

Son recommended these shoes great style quality and comfort

Best looking and most comfortable shoe adidas has out

Super comfortable I am looking to buy another pair already I love the shoes

This is a super comfortable super hip pair of shoes that I run in and wear casually I love them

If you go by European sizing the sizing is correct Sadly that sizing does not transfer to US sizing I am a 37 5 and normally a women7 5 in US sizing In adidas I am a 6 5 in women 

it is super comfortable the fit is great for an everyday wear

I heard it ran a little big because of the PrimeKnit so I went half a size down and it fits me perfectly In terms of comfort I do not think I could ask for anymore than the Ultra Boost offers

The only thing is the top sole part gets damaged

Very comfortable shoe If you are on your feet a lot these shoes help a lot



This is a shoe that is perfect at so many levels I love it

I have chronic hip and back pain I have noticed a great reduction in pain since wearing my ultraboost every day Bedt shoe I have ever worn period

Great shoes Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Best shoe ever I am going to be wearing these for ever

The BEST shoes I have ever had in my life I HIGHLY Recommend them to ALL From a scale of 1 10 they are a 20

Adidas boost shoes are the best I own a pair of Nmdand Inikitoo

The best pair of shoes I have ever worn I could not have asked for a better pair to put on my feet

Comfortable when walking but kinda tight at top offoot

I like the performance of these shoes however I dislike how hot they make my feet

This is the ONLY shoe I have worn that is true sizing for me I typically go 1 2 to full size up from a 10 for width comfort All my shoes range that way I fit a size 10 comfortably and the PK material is excellent it is sock like without feeling like your feet are bound I could not find a pair in store or online so I incorporated this shoe into my recent you itinerary because I had to have it No regrets

Very happyand fits perfectly The Confirmed App is very lousy

Love the color and the collab itself is awesome Taking the plastic from the ocean is genius Love love love the boost

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned they are a tad bit narrow if you have wider feet but the material stretches fine around them

Best shoes I ever owned Feels like walking on a cloud Look great Great for running

The shoe is very comfortable and the colorway is very nice The shoe is a little bit brighter than in the picture

Most comfortable shoe on the planet I hope these become easier to purchase I need more

Comfort Easy on the knees Support at the ankles Lightweight

looks and feels great I work 12 hours shifts and it really helps me get through the day

Very snug and comfortable fit Great design and great for exercise

The Quality and cushion are perfect Even though the size is a little bit smaller But it is still fits good

Very comfy but kind of expensive 4 5 stars out of 5

The most unique pair of ultra boost for 2017 A must haveD

Ultra boosts are the most comfortable shoes out right now

Best shoe ever This is my second pair I gave the chance of trying something else because of the low availability of the Ultraboost but nothing is comparable Thanks Adidas to put additional shoes in stoke I could not grasp a Barley cage pair sad face

My grandma says these are the most comfortable shoes she is ever worn and she is like 100 so she is been through some shoes As for me I have several pairs boost beats bubbles any day

The ultra boost is a great and outstanding shoe made by adidas

I got these shoes as a birthday present for my mom She loves the color on these and so do I She really thinks they are the most comfortable shoe on the market Also she loves the idea that they were also helping the environment a tremendous amount

The shoes are extremely comfortable I love that they are made from recycled material

Wish I would have read reviews to Size up Little tight

Very comfortable very balanced great durability the perfect shoe

The fit and look is amazing The shoe does run a little small but overall very happy with it

Great sneaker great look Love the concept of recycled ocean plastics

The most comfortable shoe I have worn True to size and good style

Very comfortable shoes Best shoes I ever purchased

Most comfortable shoes on the market in an amazing colorway

These shoes are awesome and for a good cause They fell very comfortable like all ultraboost that have been made

Boost and parley are a great combination Very comratable

Great quality just like all the rest ultra boost a little narrow and snug but not a real issue size up if you want a little more room in width

Love them good cause and a good shoe Love the color

Stabilizes my foot no more plantar fasciitis softest feel yet still provides maximum support

Great product with an awesome message Would love to purchase more from the Parley Adidas Collaboration

Status Cool Theses shoes are great But can be hard to get size 12 5

great recycling of materials love the idea and look forward to more of this

So comfy and eco friendly I love them so much Ty

It is the best shoes that I have found ever it is so cool

these boys is hot real quality stuff feels real tight though the pureboost fit much better but these look just too ill

Saving the world one shoe at a time Awesome collaboration Maximum comfort



These just feel more stiff than other 3 0s They look cool I think if I went 1 2 size bigger it would be fine possibly a full size

Look comfort color

Looks and feels amazing I have gotten a load compliments and looks from people

These shoes are the bees knees gotta love them yeah baby

I guess since these were made from recycled materials it made the sizing a bit off

it is the most comfortable not sacrificing style

It is a great shoe living up to the expectations I have set for Adidas Ultraboost

Excellent shoes The boost midsole is unbelievably comfortable and the they fit nearly perfect The only thing is that the toe box is a little tight from the compression of the upper I only wish that ultraboost were readily available in every color

I love the style of the shoe and the background behind the shoe really is a good looking shoe and like all ultraboost it is comfortable

Super comfortable and looks great but a little short in length

Materials are spot on Design is magnificent Just wish it was a 13

Very Comfortable I was fortunate to get one and feels lucky

The best running and everyday shoe I have ever owned can not imagine wearing anything else

The shoe provides a lot of cushion when running was true to size

The shoe is very comfortable However it is a bit snug A couple wears and it stretched out because you of the PrimeKnit I did notice a stitching becoming undone after the third wear of casual use

Love the ultra boost just wish a size 13 was available

The shoe runs very small on the feet which makes it hard to purchase right

it is a cool shoe recommended because it is very comfortable

The design is superb The shoe is comfortable and the colorway is spectacular

Nice shoes comfortable nice color Little tight a

Very comfortable shoe kind of tight but if you take the insole out or go a half size down you should be ok

I am now on my 3rd pair Ultra Boost is hands down the best distance trainer available The cushion leaves your body and feet feeling refreshed after pushing long miles I have turned several friends on to Ultra Boost now they will not run in anything else These are super popular if you see your size grab them because they will sell out fast

Most comfortable shoes you will probably ever wear Yet they look super cool Possible best shoes ever

The concept behind the shoes is an awesome idea but Im not sure if it was because of the materials used the shoe felt smaller than other UB 3 0 that I have

Ultra Boost Wins I purchased this show and it was so comfortableI sometimes forgot I had shoes on Ultra Boost helped me run a little further a little faster I get compliments on my sneakers all the time I went ahead and bought a 2nd pair just because I can not live without these sneakers Ultra Boost wins again

When I received my ultraboost there was dryed on glue that will not come off

Need I say moreNeed anyone say moreThese are probably the most comfortable shoes ever made At least top 5 in the history of sneakers The Primeknit upper is unbelievably soft and stretchy to the point where it might be too stretchy for serious runners The Boost midsole is the thickest and most comfortable iteration of the technology the EQT Support 93 17 may have more Boost but not as balanced as these Wearing these feels like walking on clouds with the most comfortable pair of socks on it is pure magic do not hesitate when you see these restocked Buy them

The product is perfect purchasing was a pain I understand it was a limited item and all but the hassle was unnecessary Spend 3 and a half hours with 0 exaggeration online selecting size and doing the I am not a robot test to finally successfully purchase the item But the item itself is great so my boyfriend says



Incredible quality incredible cause The cage is almost reflective so it makes the shoe really pop

Size upwhen you buy these cause the plastic makes it not as loose

These shoes are amazing I am very fond of boost technology After wearing my CrazyLightBoost 2016 for basketball and buying NMD R1s for my wife I really had to try out the beloved Ultraboost Lemme tell you these are truly amazing They fit perfect on my feet and they are super light and breathable Primeknit is no joke either haha The only gripe I had with these shoes is that sometimes the supportive cage wrap end would poke onto the top of my toes I solved this by loosening the laces a bit I know this will not effect everyone but maybe it is something to keep in mind Overall these shoes are the best running casual shoes I have ever put on Thank you Adidas for making these I love these so much I have already bought two pairs Hoping to collect more down the road

Honestly my favorite shoes I have ever owned Comfortable and look great I am up to 5 different colorways and plan to keep adding Ultra boost are in my opinion the best shoes on the market right now

Great Shoes perfect fit very forgiving on the heels

The box design is goofy Shoe is super comfortable Shopping was lightning fast

I love ultraboosts and will buy them without a second thought However the Parley have a much different fit to them I am not sure if it is because of the recycled materials or what but the entire primeknit is much much stiffer than the regular UB It is much tighter around the top of the foot and you can not move your toes around as much as the knit is not as soft and flexible I had to order a full size up from the regular UB3 series Still debating on whether or not I want to keep them I still recommend them because the sole is still the best thing to happen to my feet in a long time

It fits snug and is very comfortable I love the fact that these shoes are helping save the environment

Just Love EveryThing Adidas Not To Mention The Rrcycled Material In This Shoe

The shoe runs bigger than my true size I am size 10 but has to get 9 5

Comfortable stylish eye popping colors The shoe is also made from recycled materials which is cool

I am a huge fan of ultraboost they are extremely comfortable

Need serious quality control and make sizing standadize

The pictures on Adidas website do not accurately represent the color that it actually is

The product looks and feels great The color looks better in person

Ultra boost are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned no contest keep doing your thing adidas

Great fit very comfortable shoe I would recommend to others

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn looks great too

I love them very comfortable They are very stylish while helping the earth at the same time

Love the collaboration with Parley great back story and very environmental friendly The wave inspired heel cup is eye catchy and the non translucent cage is a nice change The Parley branding is perfectly placed on the tongue caged and the heel pull uncaged and ALL the blues blend perfectly

Returned the shoe due to width problems Overall amazing shoe but constricting over the top of the ankles

great shoes very comfortable to wear

It a beautiful piece od work but jus that it run a bit small

I have been a consumer of the ultra boost for sometime now and this collaboration with Parley is a must have for the casual or SneakerHead A footnote on these was that they were a little snug than normal I am assuming that the materials of using recycled flotsam and jetsam had a little play in the slight fitted issue than normal

Plz keep the boost coming they all amazing and the limited release have been fire

Parley ultraboost run smaller than regular 3 0 boost which makes them true to size since 3 0 have more room in the fore foot area

Cool design and colors but way too small and shoelaces are too short

Awesome shades of blue for summer Perfect fit Love the fabric cage

Colorway is on point and fits well great job Adidas

First pair of Ultraboost and will not be my last for sure

Comfortable and fits well Looks great too just laces are a little too bulky in my opinion

The coloring and quality are awesome Its nice to have a different product than all the rest out there

Great Love them I am a teacher and I feel like I am bouncing through my classroom all day My feet are no longer tired at the end of the day

Simply the most conformtable shoe out Boost is life

Love the ParelyThe blue color really sells it

Love ultra boosts Best shoe out there Collaboration with Parley for a fire shoeWhy not

This shoe is AMAZING Parley is awesome and changing the world The color is really nice Boost is still the best cushioning in the world so overall this shoe kills it Love Love Love

Make larger sizes you are 12 5are more like 11 

A big too narrow and too tight They are comfortable but I recommend going up 1 2 size A bit overpriced in my opinion

I really love the design I personally hate caged ub but not this one Sexy and comfortable describes everything

The entire project from recycling trash from the ocean and ending up with a product that is this great just makes them a no brainer Great stuff Adidas Please keep up all the hard work

They cost a pretty penny but are worth the pretty penny They look really cool and are seriously the most comfy shoe I have ever owned If they could make my dress shoes ultraboosts my life would be complete

Awesome product The ultraboost line is one of the best shoes adidas has to offer Great comfort great design awesome cause

Very comfortable great color good to run in durable

The message Parley brings to sportswear really created a great atmosphere for the future of sportswear

Fantastic comfort I would recommend to anyone I love the ultra boost style

Fits 5 too small then regular ultra boost Should fix this problem and are drop them

Ultraboost is the best shoe on the market Parley is cool because they are helping the environment I wish the Parley Ultraboosts had their own special box though

Love the Ultra Boost Own several Love the multiple color options

It was too small i have another pair of UB of the same size and these fit too small

Too tight on the back part even after a half size up Need to go at least a full size up

Good quality and style Fit good and good value for the price

The Parley Ultraboost is another excellent collaboration with great quality The only grip I have is the fact they fit slightly tighter than the rest of my Ultraboostu200b shoes

Amazing comfortable and perfect for just about any day

These are the most comfortable shoe out there I tore my Achilles twice in a row and these shoes are perfect for me They have a soft back which is perfect for my Achilles These are very lightweight but very comfortable

I love the concept of the shoe Great looks Fits 5 small

The fact that this shoe is made out of plastic bottles amazes me I can tell almost no difference in comfort or quality from my other ultra boosts which is great Definitely my favorite pick up so far this year Keep doing what you are doing adidas

Another excellent colorway of the Ultra Boost The only negative is that the shoes are a bit tight compared with the other 3 0 colorways

Great shoe the Parley model fits snug for some reason Still wearable but I should have gotten a 1 2 size bigger

If you are getting these I would go a half size up Other than that it is an ultra boost the comfort and style is still there

Love my Ultraboost feels like walking on clouds

Great innovative shoe and spectacular idea to use recycled materials

The comfort and the way the texture looks like waves in the ocean Every time I put them on I feel like I am at the beach

These seemed to be a bit below quality standards and missing boost cernels

Once again adidas hit it out of the park with this pair along with supporting a great cause I hope they continue the Parley movement with additional colors

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Insanely comfortable lightweight and breathable and they look amazing

I do not think that these came out the way Adidas wanted them to

great shoe wish the silver boost popped a bit more against the white upper all in all very cool shoe

It is a good shoe overall and super nice design super comfy

My shoes sewing is messed up but I can not return it or else i can not get a replacement because they are out of stock

Incredible shoe with a wonderful message Looking forward to future Parley releases

Keep um coming Adidas and I am gonna keep buying You guys are crushing the sneaker game right now

I own three pairs of ultraboosts and they are all great Very comfortable and stylishyou can exercise in them or wear them out Highly recommend

love the ultra boost most comfortable shoe ever

Parley represents saving the environment in a cool fashionable way You can actually wear the change you are making right on your feet I love their concept and mixed with the Ultraboost the shoe could not get any better I really like the beautiful ocean color to these too It also goes without saying that the boost makes these extremely comfortable to wear

Pretty much the same as the other ultraboost needs come up with new style with different color ways

This Ultra Boost is overall a great shoe It has a very nice flowing primenit that goes with the foot and the boost adapts to your foot sole very quick to allow a very comfortable step My one flaw on the show is sometimes a peice of boost falls off Still overall this is one of adidas best shoes

The product is very comfy and is made of ocean material

It is an amazing product it is so soft unlike NMD or yeezy

Best shoe ever made Even better than the Jordan 

Best shoe made I strongly recommend to anyone I have a large collection of ultra boost and nmd

This is a great show would recommend for everyone

These are excellent and comfortable running shoes

Some of the most comfortable shoes put my AirMax to shame as far as comfort

I have med wide feet and these run narrow and long Adidas sizes are inconsistent need to figure out there sizesAll different

Smooth and comfortable Plus the shoe i was looking forever

Awesome shoe Only one complaint and this is on every 3 0 is the plastic at the top of the toe box I know why it is there but makes it not as comfy as the 2 0

Best shoe in the market both comfort and aesthetic

I can wear these all day work home and to bed

Great PK material durable stylish good for standing

This is my first Ultraboost It is so comfortable

one of the best ultraboost color so far so comfort fit true to size

The new prime knit upper is superb and is super plus cannot recommend this shoe enough

It is very snug on my foot and looks good It also has a very comfortable material on the inside

best shoe i have ever bought and it looks freaking great

The shoe is high quality very comfortable and light

The ultra boost is seriously the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I am definitely buying another pair

Love the neutral color while still being very unique and stylish No other shoe compares when it comes to comfort Best shoe I have ever owned

First ultra boost I have ever owned not the last man

These shoes are exceptionally comfortable Like walking on pillows Sometimes you forget you are wearing shoes at all it feels fantastic But the shoes also feel really secure and really hold your feet in place well when you are running You absolutely get what you pay for with these sneakers so it is not difficult to understand why they are so popular Runs true to size from my experience

Great service Fantastic shipping time Will buy again

They are so comfortable like walking on air The primeknit is so stretchy and form fitting

Super comfortable Addicted to boost since the first day I put my first ultra boost on

I bought these shoes for casual wear as well as going to the gym or for a run The day I got these I went to the gym and ran a little bit I looked at my shoes after and saw that the boost already ripped from just running

Ultra boost are the best sneaker on the market period Comfort feel everything

these are hard asf and mad stylish fam yuh yuh fam

Shoe felt great Went down a half size cause that is what a lot of people suggested but the fit was too tight Had return them but will be looking to purchase some other ultraboosts in the future

Comfortable And would highly recommend to a friend

Highly recommended it You will not believe how good it feels once you put them on It feels like you are wearing performance Socks on marshmallows haha

Best shoes I have ever owned so comfortable and they look awesome Been stopped a few time already people complimenting them Buy them if they are available

Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned do not like the new versions Would buy 10 pairs of these for the next few years if I could

Best Quality but need More Size 6 5 Please I wil buy today

Wish the ultra boost was not so hyped I probably would have had a much better initial reaction when putting them on for the first time

I really love the ultrabooost but it suck how they only do limited quantity

My first pair of Ultra Boost 3 0 and I am extremely satisfied Ive been the NMDlike crazy so I decided to give these puppies a try and they are stellar I would deff recommend going a half size down bc of the prime knit but still an incredible on foot feeling Thank you Adidas

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn do not be scared by the price tag as you will not regret the purchase have had these shoes for two days and I am so glad I made the correct decision I normally wear a size 13 but went down a size to get a snug fit The width is stellar the boost technology is second to none in my opinion Seriously am considering buying more of these shoes in the future Do try the shoes on before you buy is my only tip as sizing may feel different to various feet

I like the looks of them a lot but I did not get a chance to get them so please please please restock in these color

First off the UBare AWESOME Go a half size down due to the PrimeKnit being more stretchy I was a 12 in the 2 0so i picked 11 5 in the 3 0Great for anything you docasual gym work etc

I have owned the Ultra Boost 1 0 and 2 0 but for whatever reason they changed their sizing on this shoe I wear a 10 5 in everything but for Ultra Boosts 1 0 and 2 0s they fit small so I get an 11 When i got these in they were too long but i got the bottoms dirty so I do not think i can send them back

A1 Quality Easy cop Suprised this is still sitting

When I put this shoe on I could right from the first step that the hype and reviews lived up to what is been said They are now by far my go to shoe and definitely the most comfortable shoe that has ever been put on my feet Amazing job adidas I can not wait to buy more pairs

I bought these for running and they are the most responsive runners I have owned it is honestly difficult to run slow in them The return is remarkable The comfort is second to none The casual look obviously works too considering the demand for them My only request or suggestion is to design a performance minimal version with a lower drop 4MM to 8MM Similar to REDACTED Free Run Distance I would love to have that option Then it would be the only sneaker I would ever buy Other than the NMDobviously They are just fire

Was not satisfied The product I received was damaged

Great looks Incredibly comfortable lightweight etc

it is like stepping on cotton from a freshly shaved sheep

People were not kidding when they said that these shoes are the most comfortable pair that you will wear Very glad about my purchase

These are the most comfortable shoes on planet earth

They are so nice Best shoes I have ever owned comfort and look wise Love them

I like it because they go with everything that you put on

i like this shoe because it is super comfortable

This shoe combines comfort with quality attractiveness and overall excellence

Most comfortable shoe ever created Everyone should get at least one pair

I like a lot I like a lot I like a lot I like a lot

Super comfortable and great shoe Fit is true to size

This shoe is very comfortable and would recommend to anyone And just to say the 3 0 pattern is very nice as well as the color way it is self Overall Great Shoes

Make me very comfortable convenient and keep walking unlimited

It is a good shoe I am a 7 5 in other Adidas shoes but for ultraboosts I recommend going two sizes up

I have bought 2 pairs and 1 for my wife this past week Therefore I need more comfortability for feet

The 3 0 upper is way too stretchy for me Taking turns with these shoes makes my foot want to slide off the side Running in straight line and casual wear they are 5 stars And boost is the best cushion I have ever tried I also have a pair of the ST version that I prefer way better than the UB 3 0

So comfy and looks really nice Only problem is that it gets dirty easily

These ultra boosts are by far the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned and one of my favorites They have tons of support and cushioning on the heels while the knit mesh in the front really allows your feet to breathe when you are on the move They are a dream to wear for running but you gotta be careful since they are all white

Toe box is more squishy than 2 0 or 1 0 but believe it or not you get use to it It is the right amount of squishy I bought a 13 in the 1 0 which fit perfectly and should have bought my true size 12 5 in these Worth trying on before buying if you can

Very good perfect for my foot easy to put on feel comfortable while walking around

Feels great and looks great You will not regret that you brought them

Best shoe I have ever bought it Great comfy shoes

Brilliant Comfortable Really good shoe Recommend it to everyone I talk to

Terrible shoes So uncomfortable Ordered size 10 got size 5

extremely comfortable shoe highly recommend Just wish they were easier to get ahold of and on shelves for some colors

Very comfortable looks good on foot Would recommend to anyone looking for a new shoe

The product is very comfortable The product also has a perfect fit

They a very comfortable lightweight and breathable

Ultra boost are always a good look and always make a show worth looking at

Love the comfort of the shoeMakes every other sneaker feel stiff

These shoes are amazing I bought me a pair because I heard they were comfortable so I use them to cut grass Love these shoes

Go one half size down and take the insole outboostgod

These feel just amazing totally worth it you will not regret it

This is a fantastic shoe Extremely comfortable worth 180 dollars I bought one pair in August and bought another in December because I liked them so much

Everything about these shoe were great but since the cage is clear it scratches pretty easily Other than that this shoe is perfect

I love the ultra boost 3 0 I got the white and it is very comfortable

3 0 Prime Knit is very loose big miss I have three UB 1 0and 4 2 0The 1are hands down my favorite runners to date Prime knit on 3 0is very loose and does not hold my foot to the sole While walking it feels like my toes are going over the reinforced sides Running is not an option I have never had this issue with 1 0or 2 0I hope this is corrected ASAP

First of all I want to say thank you so much Adidas for creating the most comfortable shoe in the world it has help me a lot with my disability Oh my life I have been searching for comfortable shoe to help me take away my pain I suffer from chronic pain since a child I was paralyzed on my right side and had a major accident I had seven spinal neck surgeries And I have scoliosis in sciatica The ultra boosts sneaker has help me so much with my pain it relieves it when I walk I wish I can get more but unfortunately you guys never have my size and you always sold out I only own one pair and I cannot work because of my disability so I cannot buy them like that but thank you for making the most wonderful sneaker in the world God bless you

This is the most comfortable adidas shoes i have ever had and used

The 3 0 Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes that have ever been on my feet Hoping to buy another pair some time in our lifetime

Boost keeps getting better and the 3 0 is the best fit so far These run almost 0 5 size larger than the 1 0 in my opinion

it is very comfortable to wear all day long and it supports all the activity you do every day

does anyones pinky toe come off the corner when walking because of the meshlol I got this for christmas Its comfortable when walking but when i start running my pinky toe comes off the corner

This shoe is comfortable and you can wear it with anything People will recognize you in this shoe The only problem with the shoe is the quantity It restocks often but when it does it runs out quick it is sold out usually in stores and there is also people who resell the shoe for profit

This is the best Adidas shoe in the game right now It is comfortable and is very stylish

This is the most comfortable and versatile shoe ever

This product is great because the primenet and the boost goad really join together and make the shoe my favorite shoe EVER

The 3 0are the best UB to date interms of comfort but visually the 1 0are still the best I do not care for the greenish cage on the core black shoe It should have been black like the one on the womenversion As for sizing I normally wear a 13 in the 1 0 2 0 but I could easily fit in the 12 but opted with the 12 5 So yes they do run a 1 2 a size larger compared to the predecessor True to size can work if your using them casually but for running I would go down 1 2 a size I am looking forward to the triple black 3 0 as I missed out on the previous version That pretty much sums it up Keep up the good work Adidas

Really comfortable and good looking shoe but when the laces are really tight they start to chafe annoyingly

I love it is comfort Its so comfortable and i can not wait to get more

These are the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn

The most comfortable shoe I ever wore Mainly because of the upper primeknit and the boost cushioning

So comfterble they are great for running and it is easy to rock them with anything

I would and that is why I picked up the most comfortable shoes in the world

If you have the 1 0 or 2 0 ultra boosts and wish to purchase the 3 0s i recommend going a half size down I ordered the same size as I usually do and the 3 0material is a lot more stretchy and not as snug as the 1 0s nonetheless really comfortable shoes i plan on purchasing more colors

I used to be very active but over the year I have aged and slowed down This pair of shoes is walk in the air comfort it is hard for me to wear any other pair of shoes I even wanted to start running again

Hands down the best thing I have ever worn I bought one pair and immediately got 2 more

I was beyond excited when I got my first pair of Ultra Boost that I went ahead and bought a second pair I would definitely recommend these shoes I am officially hooked and I cannot imagine ever going back to any other type of shoe Thank you Adidas for making such a wonder product

The fit is a bit snug at first but because of the primeknit the upper begins to stretch and form to your foot after a few wears

Great comfort and look Simply love the Boost sole

The Boost sole was the best part of the shoe including the primeknit upper This is the first boost adidas shoes I have every bought and I am not regretting it

These are literally the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The moment you wear these you go into another dimension These shoes are unreal and I am glad I made this purchase

It was too small and the shoe was big by toe would not get

Stylish and comfy Fits any gender perfectly Simple yet classy styles

The UltraBoost is my favorite shoe for this price

this item is perfect super cool super comfortable and light

Im feeling these These dope AF Adidas wayy better than nike

I like there sneakers so so much cause you Can wear Them to an Casual look but also to an hypebeast look and they are just the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn

Definitely part of my Top 5 Top 5 Top 5 All of a sudden fam

Awesome best shoes in world I wish I could get new triple black

Very comfortable shoe to the fabric and boost very well done

I Love it I Love this color I want it

Amazing and comfortable shoes Nothing will compare to these

I really like this shoe alot I own several pairs I even uncaged my reflective 1 0Looking forward to the triple black Hope I can successfully cop

The product is pretty much the most comfortable shoe on the market The primeknit upper allows for a free sock like feeling around your foot while the rubber cage or leather cage as I have the Olympic Gold Medal provides a lockdown fit for no slippage of the heel

This shoe has been very durable for me I have wore these all around Europe in my 3 week trip and I walked an average of 8 miles a day and they still look like new 7 months later I would really recommend to try them on in store first I wear an 11 in my Yeezy Boost 350 and a 10 5 in my Tubular Runners and I had to go with a size 12 Other than that terrific shoe

The shoe is extremely stylish Not to mention the comfort that goes along with it If you have a wide foot you most likely want to stay away from them Try getting these in person because most of adidasonline stuff has a few more defects than those in stores Nothing serious tho just more noticeable glue lines and less good suede ect Lastly I suggest going half a size up or to take out the insoles

This shoe is just straight up comfortable it is just super clean and dope

At first very snug fit however after breaking in fits great Extremely comfortable

The she is very comfortable and the color goes with everything Also the color does not show dirt

I love the shoe i wich they would not sell out fast so i can more pairs

Very comfortable tight at first but fits great after a couple days

Feels like a sock acts like a track shoe and it is amazing

Very comfortable shoes I went half size up for daily wear

I just got promoted to manager and was in need of some more comfortable shoes because I would be standing a lot longer I can say without a doubt these exceeded every expectation I had I can not wait to buy my second pair I walked around malls in Dallas for five hours looking for these shoes and I decided to try on a size larger than mine just to get a feel My feet instantly stopped hurting and I knew I had to order a pair as soon as possible

This is hands down the most comfortable shoe on the market I have had comfortable shoes but the Boost and the shape of this shoe is without a doubt the most comfortable shoe you can buy It fits true to size materials used are A the durability of the shoe is A With the Continental rubber on the bottom and how flexible the shoe is this can definitely take a beating but your feet will not Plus this shoe looks sick I mean look at it

it is like walking on clouds Ultra boost has ruined other sneakers for me for sure

it is a great model No large bulky toe box not saying any names it does not lean you too far forward Has a good ride it is honestly one of the best shoes out right now I usually wear vans pros for the insole and just flat feel A lot of runners give your foot a strange position from the sole These are like walking on clouds and do not feel artificial Thank you adidas Wish they were a tad easier to get sometimes that is the only complaint

By far one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned Wish they released a larger quantity it is hard to get your hands on a pair let alone a second pair if and when these give out Also I would like to see more colors for the actual boost material white mids can get dirty fast if you are a daily wearer

Very comfortable shoes I wear them more than my slippers to be honest

It is a good shoe and very comfy but runs narrow so for up half a size

Comfort is on another level literally like walking on sponges Upper feels like a sock Perfect for running or casual use Totally recommend this shoe if its within your budget

Very Comfy Perfrect for everyday used and perfect in style

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Very comfortable and very well made shoes

I am a Nike guy but this ultra boost is really comportable

Product arrived damaged and flawed The prime knit was stretched sole had marks and a piece of boost was missing

Great look I will definitely be buying another pair

I have a wide foot so it is a bit snug but I feel like after a few wears they will adjust Overall great shoe

These shoes were so great the first time I tried them on I really like the design and how the cage supports your foot when walking around I really enjoyed walking around in these shoes The material is great and this is the 2nd most comfortable shoe I have worn I have tried on the ultra boost uncaged and felt like the uncaged version let my feet free I love the design of the original though The cage seems perfect for style and support I was going to buy these but was not able to yet again because of the price I would love to own a pair and go walking and running

Excellent quality shoe Can go with so many different outfits The Boost is so comfy I even wear them in the house

Ordered these after hearing about them being restocked They are pretty expensive but these shoes are extremely comfortable and have a premium feel to them I was pretty skeptical towards buying them at first but I definitely feel I made the right choice I recommend these to anybody looking for stylish and comfortable shoes

The shoes are extremely comfortable when I go on my exercise routine and when simply walking on a casual day When running you can really feel the boost working cushioning every single step especially since I land on my heels when running Best running shoe out on the market for meI will definitely be buying more pairs of the UltraBoost Just waiting for those triple black 2 0to drop

Best sneaker on the market Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned The height of fashion and comfort in one shoe Well done Adidas all of your shoes should have boost going forward

Easily one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn I was hesitant at first due to the steep price point but finally pulled the trigger and I do not regret it Super comfy all around from the cushioning to the material around the shoe Great for casual wear like how I use them

Perfect mix of style comfort and quality A true everyday shoe that can be worn in any situation

I ordered my ultra boost core black from the official adidas website and when I received it i noticed the upper dye on one shoe was lighter than the other Really disappointed after trying hard to get my hands on a pair Hope I can be compensated somehow

Comfort

I wore them once and the stitching that held the plastic to the inside of the shoe came undone I didnt even run in them Just walked around school I would return them but it is too much hassle Reluctantly keeping them Not happy with this purchase as they were extremely expensive

Very comfortable and looks nice Worth buying and using

I actually got these a half size down since my true size was not available however the primeknit material is pretty stretchy so my toes still have wiggle room Plus I am not running in them aggressively as I primarily wear them at the gym so my toes are not being pushed up torward the tip of the shoe or anything I also have the Pure Boost 2 and for those in my regular size and they actually felt a tad big so that is the other reason I decided to half size down on these They fit like a sockkind of snug torward the top so you actually do not need to lace up too tight or at all At first glance the shoe just looks like a plain black but the design on the primeknit material is pretty detailed with different layers hues of black Sort of like a faded black charcoal certain lighting it looks navy then a darker grey and then black Any way Adidas has been coming out with so much FIRE this past year in regards to style and design with the comfort and performance to match

The boost starts to fall off and not comfortable

The Ultra Boost has to be the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn Absolutely love the fit and style Half a size UP from your true fit is recommended as they are a snug fit Wish more were Pairs and sizes were available

This shoe is the most comfortable thing I have ever put on my feet and they have been a great addition to my collection have not run in them as they are much too nice for me to want to

Very Comfortable and good look I can wear them to run or just go out on the town

I love the product Perfect all around shoe Great for anything casual wear athletic wear etc

Great looking shoe but what makes the world of a difference is it is a COMFORTABLE great looking shoeUltraBoost

This shoe is really comfortable and also looks great

The quality and comfort is unmatched The ultra boost is something everyone should own

Amazing shoe Super comfortable and a great runner

Super comfortable shoe with max style Definitely as advertised

Most comfortable shoes that I own I would like them in every color now

The product is very comfortable and is a everyday wear

It really does feel like you are walking on a cloud

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever bought When people said this shoe was like walking on the on air they were not lying This shoe feels unlike any other shoe I have worn Make sure you buy the right size and be aware that people with very wide feet might feel the narrowness at first but the shoe will adapt over time

Comfort and quality and color is onpoint as always

This is a great shoe for running or walking Fit very well

These shoes are so hard to get so I am glad I was able too Any adidas with boost technology are by far the most comfortable of any athletic brand

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Definitely recommend to any shoe lover looking for some swag

Very comfortable product the continental soles give the such grip my only thing is that once they get dirty they are hard to clean

Great comfort and style A little narrow than what I expected but overall good purchase

The shoe looks great and feels great initially but is a little tight and narrow and definitely gets dirty easily More of a lifestyle shoe than performance

got them for my son and me loves them Very comfortable

Honestly one of the most comfortable running shoes I have ever put on my foot True to size and the materials are supreme Bought these to wear to work but they are too fresh to get dirtied up

Shoe is not fit for people with wide feet buy one size larger if you really want this product

Wave is the worst thing to ever happen to Boosts This would be the perfect boost if it was 1 0 design but the wave is so ugly

The shoes are banging Would recommend No extra things to be said

I use the shoe for everything they are casual as well as great for fitness

Very comfortable and feels like pillows on the feet

Great shoe Only thing to import is offer wider width Although the primeknit makes everything comfortable I chose these over the Kayano 22 as the primeknit allowed my toes to spread Also the boost sole was definitely good throughout the footbed

I like it but it is a little small I am wearing us9 all the time but this one does not fit perfectly

These shoes lived up to the hype Most comfortable shoes I have owned

Heel pain made me switch to boost and it is meeting my expectations so far

Very soft and comfortable Would recommend buying if you like a comfortable and reliable shoe

Amazing shoe well worth the money Compare this to the Nike Air Max I would choose Ultraboosts any day Best shoe I have bought in a while

These are good looking comfortable shoes Repeated wear has resulted in pilling in the heel fabric though

I hope Adidas continues to make the regular Ultra Boost as right now it is tough to find them on the website in my size 10 5 I would also like to see them in loud colors bright greens yellows oranges and maybe even glow in the dark for night time running

best shoe on the market right now 3x whites other than yeezys best shoe out right now

Everything about the shoe is great except the sole wear Sole seems to wear down extremely fast on the pavement Hopefully can be corrected since the shoes are on the expensive side

Honestly these are the most comfortable pair of shoes to ever hit my feet and on the concrete

The perfect shoe comfort wise and aesthetically A must cop

What else can you add that hasnt already been said the boost technology is incredibly comfortable and the shoe is stylish A adidas

This shoe is comfortable well made and good looking

I have been an adiddas customer for many years have never had any problem with any products always consistent good quality materials I have a 2 year old daughter who wears her superstars on the daily bases my wife and I have matching pairs as well we have track suits sweaters tees I have a little boy on the way and he will definitely be wearing adidas gear as well Ultra boost are my go to for comfort and style

Very good and comfortable shoe I would recommend but it is overpriced

The shoe is so comfortable and fits perfectly to my feet Plus super clean and stylish

The adidas ultra boosts is the most comfortable shoe I have ever bought

These are THE MOST comfortable shoes I have ever owned in my life Hands down no question I have had foot and knee issues the last couple of years and with the Ultra Boosts I have had no issues at all because of the boost soles and knitted forefoot which does not smush my feet it is also very breathable and flexible The boost cushion is a freakin mazing It may be a bit pricey to some but think about it as an investment on your knees feet in the long run The bonus of owning these is that they are stylish as well so you can wear them anywhereBoostForLife

The shoes are very comfortable and beautifully crafted

Great product go and get a pair definitely worth it

Comfortable nice looking good shoe good brand

it is the most comfortable shoe on the planet and perfect for going places where you will be standing for a long time

Very comfortable shoes but unfortunately mine fell apart after 4 months of light wear The sole has come almost completely detached from the upper Very disappointed given how expensive these are

Excellent shoe Like wearing a pair of slippers Nice

These triple white Ultra Boosts are more impressive in person than in the pics Really bright and clean looking And yes they are the most comfortable boosts I own Great job Adidas

The boost makes these shoes so comfortable I stand all day at work and these shoes make it go by much easier I probably going go buy more colors are release the all grey ones

Great fit tight if you are not wearing thin socks

I love these shoes I wish they were easier to get but other then that no complements

This is a must to get essential to walking the earth

Very clean looking shoe all while being extreamly comfortable

Most comfortable shoe ever made Highly recommend

These are the most comfortable shoes out there I am on my feet everyday for 8 hours and I love to wear them everyday

my feet and legs usually hurt after an 8 hour work day I rarely get a chance to sit down since I work in a busy pharmacy My feet and legs do not feel as achy as they used to when I did not have these shoes They are extremely comfortable The only negative about these shoes is that they are very squeaky when I walk through the hospital

it is comfortable and stylish it is what everyone wants in a sneaker

Fits great and I can wear for hours on hours days

Enjoy this product because of the comfort and durablity The boost technology is far more comfortable then the Nike Free technology

The most comfortable shoe ever and I should have bought Boost when they first came out

These were the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn but the outsole wears out so quickly and I cant afford another pair

The most comfortable shoe I own I high recommend this product

Extremely soft when walking and running I was very impressed by the quality and the comfort A little getting used to as my feet have been so used to non flexible soles but it is in a good way Highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a new pair

One of the best shoes ever made no doubt about it

This product is amazing one of the most comfortable shoes I own The all white color way is perfect to make an impression

Love it Definitely worth the money Go buy some

Most comfortable shoes I have worn so far In them all day while at work Raises my self esteem knowing I have the freshest shoes around while not sacrificing comfort

Overall the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have 5 pairs of ultra boost and will continue to buy more colorways

Comfort is unmatched Little thin in construction The white is WHITEtough to keep it that way

Its the most comfortable shoe I have worn I highly recommend this shoe to anyone

Amazing sneaker feels like you are walking on air

Comfy and stylish I can not wait to get more in different colors

Out of all the shoes I have this one is my favorite I love it because it is comfortable

The most comfortable shoes I have seen ever had Worth the hype

Best cushioning Very comfortable Long lasting insert

if you have never tried boost your missing out on the new way to protect your feet from strainious everyday activities From working 8 hr shifts to running a couple of miles boost does it all and right now there is no competition

Fantastic best shoe I own comfortable and very stylish

I took peopleadvice to order a half size up and they fit perfectly I have only worn these shoes since I have gotten them and I have a ton of shoes Wearing these is like wearing a sock that gives amazing support from the boost I cannot recommend these highly enough Just a shame that they are always sold out but it makes sense I do not run all that much and I definitely do not work out in these but I wear them recreationally

Bought for airport travel and stalking malls easily most comfortable shoe I have owned for 20 years

I have always been a huge fan of ultraboosts The boost material is very comfortable This is my 3rd pair of ultraboosts and I can not wait to get more



really comfortable they bend and flex in all the right places so they feel natural

love them for work every day i am on my feet all day

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought just bought my second pair

Best shoe I have ever owned hands down This is coming from a 20 year Nike customer

Very comfortable shoe the boost feels amazing its like walking on a cloud The shoe is very nicley designed love the look are very dirbale You can tell its great matieral and durable Only reason i gave it a 4 was because i have flat feet and these are really good for thay except when i walk really fast or a long distance my feet will start to burn I did not expierence that in the under armour speedform vwnts that i had Not matter how fast i walked or how much long of a distance Maybe once or twice i felt like when i walked fast it was about to start but when i slowed down it was good And the speedform apollo vent keep you feet straight and are designed tobbe a naturall shoe Anyway great job adiddas iam fully satisfied just could be a little better for flat feet and yes i know you have the adidas hltra boost st but those look like a ugly tennis shoe no offenese These are the best looking ones add st to this that would be nice

most comfortable shoes I ever wore go half size up

I overall like this product because of the prime knit they use and the boost cushoning One thing that I did not like about this product was that my size was not always available for me to purchase but I understand that it was a very popular shoe but I think you should always have more in stock

most comfortable shoe i have ever owned and i look forward to owning more pairs of UltraBoosts

Show was a bitt narrower than I had hoped and not as stable as i was thinking

Very comfortable and great support for running as well as lifting

So comfortable and looks good I usually enjoy fly knots but these are so much better

I had already bought a pair of Adidas Boosts about four months ago and I was absolutely blown away by the comfort I do a lot of walking and these shoes are like walking on a foam mattress I have many athletic shoes some of them I bought for their style but some are not very comfortable I have been buying Adidas shoes since 1971 and have always found them very comfortable regardless of the style My first pair of adidas were Gazelles

This is the most comfortable shoe i have ever put on most people i know will agree with me A

Most comfortable fit like a glove overall a perfect shoe

Most comfortable shoe Ive ever worn beats any running shoe that ive worn to date It takes a while for them to break in and mold to your foot but after that youll never want to take them off

Very comfortable They run little small half size up

This product is great I can wear these casually and they look great Love these shoes

The purpose of this appraisal is to evaluate the Adidas Ultra Boost running shoe based on three criteria These criteria include comfort durability and performance With the latest technology integrated into their product Adidas claims that the Ultra Boost is currently the best running shoe on the market Therefore the targeted market for this product is frequent runners30 miles per week

A little tight across the arch of my feet But is starting to stretch out as they break in Also this particular color way is about a full size smaller than normal similar to nike

In less than a week after wearing these less than 5 times the stitching along the ankle has come undone

The reason I picked a low quality was because one of the shoes had a defect on the tongue of the right shoe the Adidaslogo is crooked other the that I highly recommend this shoe most comfortable pair of shoes iv ever worn hands down and they definitely have a wow factor

The Ultra Boosts are great shoes with two critical flaws in my experience if you are using them as running shoes 1 Primeknit durability and 2 sockliner quality

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn These are really comfy

In particular the cushion is very good

most comfortable shoe i have ever purchased they look great when worn casual as well i have 9 pair the upgrade to continental soles has been nice believe the hype

I loved the product due to the excellent fit slightly tight extreme comfort Limitless ways to wear the sneaker wth street wear clothes or with exercise clothes Big fan

Very light very comfortable very cushy I love the styling I would love to see some more with the midsole colored

The adidas ultra boost is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Only down side is the price tag and the availability of these shoes they can be a little hard to get your hands on Over all the shoe is one of the best running shoe you can buy

They look sick and I was looking for a successor to the flyknits I usually jog in These are better and nicer looking

Worth the money Great quality shoe Amazing comfort

BEST SHOES EVER My 4th pair of these Only wish they made all black including the boost material to allow wearing to work as well

Comfort lightweight material stylish and of course the boost

Kanye put me on to them They are very stylish and very comfortable

these shoes are godmode and take a dump on anything i have gotten from nike hands down so long as they keep making this shoe i will keep buying these thank you based jon wexler and thank you adidas

The most comfortable shoes ever made Perfect for every day use Perfect running shoes

Amazing shoes I really recommend them I use them everyday

The most comfortable shoes i have ever had and my favorite Adidas shoe

Nice looking shoe and the boost technology is the best to walk on The only thing is they are a little narrow at the toes

Ultra boost has easily become my go to Comfort is incredible only wish they were easier to buy colors sell out too quickly This is my second pair and I can not wait for more Fits like a sock true to size very lightweight

Best adidas shoes I have ever worn This shoes hands down look and feels comfortable

Most comfortable shoe I own I am a fan of the silhouette Great quality

Love the ultra boost comfort when you walking with it But when you are driving sometime you will start feeling the plastic strip on the side It will start giving you some uncomfortable feeling and which turned into annoying love you driving long distance But it is a best pair of walking and running shoes that you can every own

The color is too bright does not look the same the color in the picture

Unlike all the hypebeasts out there I actually run in these with that said I can say that these are the most comfortable running shoes I have ever had very comfortable They also give you that spring in your step you need for running 10 10

mesh over the front toe area is not supportive enough On a down hill run my foot slides forward laking enough stability That said it is the most comfortable run in my life Looking for a different model with more support up front with the same comfort HHmmmmm

I will start by saying I bought these for running and casual wear I am really excited about these shoes They are extremly soft and have responsive cushioning I did not get what that meant until I actually put in the running miles I live in the city so mainly I run on hard pavement and these bad boys did everything right when your foot hits the ground it supports all of your foot and not just the heel and when your ready to go up for the next stride it is really good at responding to that I urge those on the fence as I was for three months to get them Worth the expense if it does not dent your wallet so badly Also for my fellow sneakerheads these look great with joggers jeans and khakis no question they are worth the hype

Shoes are comfortable but for wide feet its not great

I have a hard time finding running shoes and these are the most comfortable Ive found

I have been wearing this shoe casually for the past 2 weeks and I could not be more happy with it The shoe is unbelievably comfortable it is great for people who have come off of knee surgery It provides the shock absorption that I so desperately need Big ups to Adidas for making a quality shoe

I love Ultra Boosts They are my second favorite shoe next to the Yeezy Boosts because they are so stylish and comfortable I probably wear Ultra Boosts 5 days a week

They are super comfortable and look great My new shoes for the NFL season go COWBOYS

I have large toes and the toe box is a bit small I have a pair of nikes where the print on the toe box started to peel since my big toe sticks up It is hard to fix this since the design is inside I am a bit worried that the silver design will made due to this unless the toe box is woven and the design does not start from underneath

This one like Fish skin But it does not matter 

They are the best shoes I ever owned and I love it

This is a great sneaker Very comfortable Wider feet may want to go 1 2 size up

One word ULTRABOOST A sneakerhead who loves comfort and design My only thing is if they can reduce the price so ordinary people per say can afford it

The color also awesome

Love the ultra boost product line The bronze heal was great addition to my ultra boost collection

I will not talk trash about the shoes I know they are the best pair of shoes I have ever worn Just make them them last longer than 2 months

So Comportable Nice fit and Great shape I recommend this shoes

I have two pairs of the Ultra Boost and both have torn in the exact same spot I have worn each pair a maximum of 10 times to work nothing strenuous and neither held up to simple walking Very disappointed

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn and I have been running for over 40 years

I have a normal foot I wear all kinds of shoes The Ultra Boost is unnecessarily tight over the top of foot and in the toe box I was excited but my heart sank No dice for the Ultra Boost and the Ultra Boost Uncaged looks terrible so no reason to even try it on

This shoe will help you run faster stronger and longer distance The comfort it provides is second to none

These shoes are honestly amazing The fit comfort and ride are all perfect and these shoes are amazingly comfortable One gripe that I do have though is that they are slightly flimsy In fact my cage tore within a week of wearing these shoes So watch out for the durability because these should last much longer considering the price tag

nice shose good ultra boost good good good good

The fit look and comfort of this shoe is spot on However I have never worn a shoe that repeatedly makes my feet so hot I either have to stop running or switch them out half way through the day due to discomfort A problem I have never had with other running shoes I thought these would breathe really well with the mesh upper but it does not seem to be the case For the price I can not say I would recommend these

My life is the best shoes too easy color costs in mind

Great color great fit very comfortable and the softest bounciest shoes I have ever worn

So comfortable and the colorway is stunning I can not wait to get another pair

The comfort level on these is off the chart

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have owned

Great shoe but came in poor shape Had glue stuck to the front of the shoe and shoelaces were stained

very gooooooooooooood this is perfect shoes i love it

Much more comfortable than the NMD without a doubt

Adidasadidas is the best when it comes to comfort

You can describe me as a new runners less than 18 months practicing running as a sport I tried difrents running shoes but these ones are the best ones so far it is like running on clouds I do not stop telling my friend that they need to buy one pair I have even use them to work I will definitely buy the Uncaged version I will never run in other shoes

I work for adidas and I am also and everyday runner I love this shoe but I am getting sick of the shoes not being in stock I for one run in the shoes like its intended purpose unlike the people who wear them for fashion My pair I have now are banged up and I need new ones But it seems like every time they restock it is all gonna I do not know what to do anymore This is frustrating

Great shoe Been wanting to try boost and it was worth it I really wish they had something like this for basketball though

I like this product because it is super comfy I would wear these every day

Because ultraboost size for men is no longer suitable for me

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever bought Usually I have to size up a 1 2 size on adidas but this is nice and roomy

Love the Ultra Boost On my third pair Buy the newest as they update

Other than narrow width this is a superior shoes

They are a bit too narrow After running a few miles I injured my feet due to the fact that they are too narrow I really wanted to love these shoes but after this painful experience I can not I have tried many adidas shoes before and i have never had this problem Maybe I got the wrong size I do not know but I can not wear them again to run

Overall a great combination of style comfort and durability all together Well worth it is price as far as quality goes Love being able to recognize the silhouette as an Adidas design without slapping a giant Logo all over it

This is my second pair I really like the addition of the Continental rubber much better traction and feels more durable Ultra Boost is the best distance running shoe I have ever had I notice much less impact on my body after long runs It is idea for steady pace tempo running

I like the product But I would like the ability to customize it or be able to buy it in all black

I love the boost technology the shoe is so comfortable it is so light but Adidas you just need to restock more of these can you guy email me about this shoe when it will restock again

I like this shoes because it is really comfortablexe2 x9d xa4

erhmagawdddd ive been living life all wrong up to this point

Best shoe I have ever worn and owned More comfortable than a comfort slide

The knit of the top shoe gives a custom fit on first wear This pair took a couple days to break in for the sole but now I am gliding along This is my third pair of ultra boosts ran my first marathon in my last pair and trained for it in the pair before This ultra boost set is for my own road running

These are absolutely the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn That being said it was difficult to choose a size because the best fit for running was my true size but unfortunately I would have to size up if I wanted to wear these as a regular shoe because of the way they grip my feet What feels amazing for running eventually hurts the roof of my foot when i am not active because of the pressure So unfortunately I will not be wearing these shoes as much as I would like to but when it comes to running I have never worn anything like it and it is definitely my favorite shoe

This shoe is very comfortable Quite possibly the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

I was first drawn to this type of shoes from it is style being black of course and heard from my good friend who had his own pair that it was super comfortable he described it as walking on clouds and he was right

I typically wear mens US 13 These felt pretty snug

Probably the comfiest shoe I own The NMD City Sock is close behind but this shoe feels fantastic on feet

Favorite shoe ever If you get this it is worth your mony the quality prime nit uper feels amazing once on your foot

There perfect for every day use besides just working out

Loving the boost Best shoe I have ever put on feet waiting to get more colors

Most comfortable shoes i ever had

They are a perfect shoe They fit perfect Love them

Great shoes very comfortable They do run narrow so go true to size or half size up for additional comfort

Boost is everything Great shoe to walk in and exercise One of the most comfortable shoes ever like no joke I bought these true to size for my foot and thank god the size and fit were perfect The only reason why I say that because it is so hard to even try on these shoes in store They either have them but not my size With some adidas shoes I have to go a half size down and sometimes up But if you like the snug fit I would go true to size for this running shoe Im definitely gonna try to get another pair

Lightest most comfortable trainers on the market

Great shoe Great style Must buy at least a half to full size bigger than your normal size

I have a pair of NMDand they are pretty comfortable so I knew that the ultra boosts would be to the same comfort but was I wrong The ultra boost are 100x more comfortable and fit really snug for maximum comfort the boost sole is just amazing

Got these for my husband And he loved them Not only is the color great for summer but the comfort is amazing He is looking forward to other color ways dropping so he can cop them too

bought these for my boyfriend and was not sure what size to get but the 11 fit great he usually wears 10 5 in nikes and the 11 in the ultra boost are perfect

Very comfortable shoe like the different colorways

These Ultra Boosts are by far the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned and worth every penny

it is so comfortable It feels like your walking on air

Probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn looking forward to the new colour ways to come

Fit and quality of the shoe is perfect My only complaint is the comfort I like to do 10 mile runs in the morning and I fould this shoe to be way to comfortable 

Well just like everyone says These kicks truly are incredible and comfortable Worth the investment

Boost is the secret of my energy Wear them all day everywhere

Great shoes very lite and comfortable Great color

Extremely comfortable running shoes that at least make me feel faster The Continental rubber is a great upgrade from the previous year model

The most comfortable running shoe I have ever had Great combination of style and performance I owned a pair to wear fashion wise but this was my first ultra boost purchase for actually running and wow Really comfy and smooth transitions from heel to toe

The ultra boost changed my life The comfort level is ridiculous It made me leave other sneaker brands behind The best feeling shoe and it looks good What more can you ask for

When I got these the moment I tried them on a fell in love with them

Super comfortable and great looking By far the best shoes I have ever worn

Very Comfortable Lightweight Great for long periods of walking and running

Once you go black Performance and And aesthetics Such a nice shoe So comfortable love it

See what nike has

Most comfortable shoe I have worn All around perfect

I went a half size up I am usually a 11 5 in mens and went for a 12 and it fits nicely I do not have a wide foot either That of course depends on your socks I do not wear the thickest of socks but I do wear socks with these Very comfortable and very light for casual wear would not be surprised at how comfortable they would be to run in

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have recommended to my friend an coworkers And the result is that they have the same feelings too

One of the most comfortable shoes around I have 6 pairs now in different colors I only recommend first time buyers to go up a half size just to be safe can not go wrong with the ultra boost

Most comfortable sneaker I ever wore also love the quality and style Will definetly be buying from Adidas in the near future I am off the Nike waveTeamAdidas

compared to free runs these breathe better so my feet do not get hot Very comfortable shoe it is also very low The new support for the 2 0 feels great

Boost is nowadays essentials is like you are walking in the clouds a pillow on your feet

Worth every dollar

 light comfotable softWorth itthat is all i want to say

it is a breathable comfy shoe that looks great on feet I live inCarolina so during the summer it is hard to look dope and stay comfortable but this shoe allows me to do just that

Overall the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Used to be strictly Nike but these shoes changed the game Get a pair now and try them out

These are by far the most cushioned athletic shoe you will try The full length boost midsole is like walking on a cloud and you can be on your feet for hours in these They provide a decent amount of support as well however I would not recommend them for running for there are more supportive options The primeknit upper provides a nice and light yet form fitting fit It holds together very well too My only complaint is that the Continental traction on the bottom is not all that it is hyped up to be Other than that this shoe is great

I own 5 pairs of these ultra boost and they have spoiled me Most comfortable shoe on the planet Now if they would only make a flip flop or sandals with boost soles

Very comfortable Very light as if you do not wear shoes i strongly recommend this shoes

you need to make white shoes with glow in dark black stripes

Everything is great with the exception of the sole on the back as it sticks out and is not cut in a specific geometrical shape nor is it symmetrical to the other shoe Makes it look unfinished as shown in the images attached

Super comfortable and quality is great If you are considering this shoe buy it

Typically when it comes to kicks I wear Nikesthat aspect of my life was a complete mistake I can say without exaggerating that the Ultra Boosts are the best and most comfortable shoes I have ever flexed on my feet My swag has exponentially grown since I purchased them and coincidentally they knock about 3 minutes off your mile time They look and feel awesome and I will run in them until the soles fall off

Major sneaker head and they are the greatest shoes I have ever owned

I uncage the shoes and after 5 wears to school the sole seperated one day in PE The shoes are now unwearable and were a complete waste of money and wish I could just return them

I do not use the shoes for sport but a great shoe for casual use in the summer

it is very comfortable shoes fit is too tight color is too whitey price is expensive

They are so comfy and look very good I have the all white ones and get constant complements about them

I have worn a lot of brands and a lot of types of running shoes with this being my first ultra boost I can easily say it is the best one I have ever had

Very soft and comfortable good for running and walking

The boost technique is fantastic Very comfortable to walk and run Highly recommended

This is my everyday go to shoe there is nothing that compares to the comfort of the ultra boost Not only the technology behind it but the pure aesthetic of the model leaves all of its competitors in the dust

These are the most comfortable shoes own and I own a lot of shoes

the shoes are super comfortable really recommand

I have only had these shoes for a week the greatest running shoe ever they offer good cushioning and support and also look great

Great shoe one of the most comfortable I have ever worn Had to go 0 5 size up for it to fit Fits like a glove Definitely adding many pairs to my collection

These are the most comfortable shoe I have in my closet

Best pair of running shoes there is Would recommend to anyone looking for a new running shoe

I have been a Nike fan my entire life I recently got my first pair of boosts I have about 50ish pairs of Nikes Jordans and this was my 3rd pair of boosts and I am am thinking of selling my Jordans to buy more boosts I love them I have the pure boost rocket boost and now the Ultras I highly recommend these to anyone

Always been a fan of them superstars now I am so addicted with all the nmd runners Quality wise is always a superb Highly recommended shoe brand

With the Ultra Boost Phenomenon going on its hard to grab a pair in popular colors An intended running shoe turned fashion shoe is super comfortable for casual wear Worth to grab the other color variations if you are a runner it is worth the investment for long distance runs

The most comfortable shoe i ever worn UB set a new standard for comfort hands down

As a sneakerhead I have owned a lot of shoes and these are by far my new favorites They surpass my other shoes in comfort fit and even style Love the way they look and feel Quality shoe that is worth every penny of that high price tag

The shoe not only fits great and looks great but the comfort of the shoes is untouchable

Best shoes I have ever bought Totally worth it because no other shoe is this comfy The quality of the shoe is so good that it makes your foot fit like a sock

They fit me true to size I am a regular size 13 would Medium standard size that most size 13 shoes are There pretty durable I wear for causal use what drew me to them were the not only the colorway but I tried them on in store and they felt like walking on cloud 9

Up and walking all day for 12 hrs no problem Ultra boost got my knees and back So comfortable

This shoe is amazing all around Comfort versatility and durability all in one shoe I recommend this not only for runners but for an everyday shoe as well

Best for daily use Good for hiking Especially on trails

The shoes are awesome after you break it in a little I would give it 5 5 on every category but the boot dug a little bit onto my upper foot After wearing it for a bit it started to loosen up The cushion is great and the design is very nice I can see why it is sold out in many places looks great wearing it causally or running in them

Love these ultra boosts the boost sole is like walking on pillows Had to go 0 5 up for the length to be good Shoe fits pretty snug around foot initially but loosens up with use Highly recommend especially for running

These are the second most comfortable shoes i have ever worn NMDs fit my foot better but I have heard other people say that NMDs are the second most comfortable for them

do not EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT HAVE ABOUT 7 PAIRS

Great shoe for people who need neutral running shoes Very comfortable but if you are an over pronator you should look into shoes that offer more structure On the other hand they look really cool so you can wear them as everyday shoes Not a lot of other running shoes can fit that roll

Last August I bought my first pair of Ultra Boosts I had done my first 1 2 Marathon that month in a pair of Response Boosts and when I decided to train for my first full marathon which I did in January I thought I would better buy the best Boost Adidas offers After putting about 500 miles on them a friend of mine who is a runner advised me to get another pair as I am training for marathon2 next month I took them pair2 out of the box and literally did a 9 mile run and their was no working them in at all Pure comfort right out of the box I do not know what slight modifications have been made to the latest model as opposed to the ones I just bought but the 2nd pair seems to tie better and hold my foot in place

I love this shoe it is the most comfortable runner I have ever used But the thing is there is way too much hype I just need to buy a black pair of ultraboosts for running however there are sizes available there is not my size The reason being is hypebeasts wanting several shoes to resell I just need one pair Just one Other than that this is the GOAT Please make enough quantities so that people who actually use the shoe can get them without worrying about resellers bots and hype beasts

it is a good shoe mostly hyped but if you like it go for it

this shoe is so amazing that i do not think that I am walking actually

Great shoe great cop you kust but comfort is phenomenal in every way imaginable

The gradient pattern feels a bit thinner than the OG whites that came out in 2015 but the continental soles lasts longer The fit is a bit more roomy I recommend these This is a great sho3 for summer it is like clouds on my feet

Comfortable quality materials and looks great But because of the color I definitely will not be working out in them

Purchased this shoes as soon as I got notifies in Twitter due to the comfort and style of the shoe

So I have mostly worn Nike for running and training but the ultra boost is indeed more comfortable The prime knit is very nice breathable more of a sock like material to flyknit and keeps my foot in place prob the cage as well compared to my racers The only thing I probably have an issue is that the outer sole does not really last too long Personally I use the shoe for training

Anything with adidas boost technology has an amazing feel Add the ultra post silhouette and prime knit material and you too may have a new favorite sneaker I highly recommend

The hype is huge but the comfort and sizing is all off And why make shoes that gets put on like socks with lacesChoose one socks or laces can not have both Making it impossible to fit and if I get a size bigger makes me look like clown feet My friends told me the most comfortable shoes ever But personally to me it was one of the most uncomfortable shoes

The Ultra Boosts are incredible I did not buy them to run or work out in just for style but I will definitely be buying a second pair for those uses They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I feel very relaxed when wearing them The soft foam like insides are great I am very satisfied with my purchase Adidas really stepped it up with this line and have satisfied many people

Amazing I have the first Core black ones and the first all white ones can not say anything about them other than the white ones get dirty really fast which is going to happen if you wear them These new ones are really solid They have a little more weight on them but the sole is really solid The old ultra sole tends to wear out pretty fast This new continental sole is insane I also have nmdand these are way more comfy One of my top shoes for sure

Best running shoe ever Super comfortable and stylish

I both this shoe like a few months ago and if your looking to by a shoe that has boost this the one they are so comfy they are the way more comfortable than any Nike I can not go back to no free runs these are the top

There is absolutely nothing on the market that compares to these Full length boost mid sole is the best comfort and most premium material you will find Top that off with the Primeknit upper which again is the most premium material you will find that is extremely soft flexible and comfortable

Shoes are so comfortably its unreal I bought them A To run in but To have a comfortable shoe for my long shifts at the hospital The Ultra Boost design is literally no joke I have been uber pleased with this purchase Wish they could be a little bit lighter but would not trade the cushion to make shoe more lightweight

a very comfortable shoe for walking and running will not disappointed well worth the money sizing wise stay true to size the fit on ankle is little bit tight but is normal

could not ask for a more comfortable clean shoe to wear anywhere

So Clean and Beautiful

love the shoes but i was wondering i have 2 pairs and one fits great and the other with the continental thread at the bottom is a bit tighter is that how it is supposed to be

The ultra boosts are by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever had and they are gorgeous

Had to get these looked comfy and they were I might get the grey ones if they ever restock

My ultraboosts arrived today and I went to try them on right away but they were not what I expected they felt a little to tight and the part where your foot enters the shoe seemed to be squeezing my ankle a little too much who knows maybe they will loosen up but for now not as comfortable as everyone says

I love the shoe it is self but the knitting gets dirty super fast and not many things can clean it

Pretty good product but I recommend going a half size bigger for a better comfort

These Ultra Boosts are all the hype and then some The most exciting shoe I have ever worn

it is a great shoe but the shoe runs a little small

Boost is the best technology I ever seen on a shoe grate for long walks perfect for running and amazing for everyday use I highly recommend these shoes to anybody fits through the size and the boost is just amazing

works great on myshort and long runs enjoyed them since my first run

If you saw any of the original ultra boost you would be surprised You you will be surprised because the old colors looked so appealing to the eye but these new colors are trash Exsurcharge the all white or all gray

Soft and comfortable is true but the quality check need to be improved

Can wear with anything

They are light and and comfortable at first The boost the material looses it spring quickly and its feel becomes a bit stale the sole does not last very long after a month of use the soles where already worn to the boost material wish they were designed with a tongue instead to be able to control how the knit material presses against the top of your foot

This is the best shoe shoe I have ever owned I have gone from NIKE to Adidas over night The Ultras boost is a must

PLEASE ADD DIFFERENT WIDTH OPTIONS FOR WIDER FEET Adidas

I have two pairs of these and they are all i wear They are insanely comfortable i believe these should be in everyones rotation my mother even owns a pair

The most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I have a decent amount of shoes and the ultra boost by far is the most comfortable If you are thinking about getting them do it It is a great shoe and the ultra boost sells out pretty fast So if a store has your size scoop them up

From the moment I tried on my first pair I was immediately addicted I have never in my 29 years felt a shoe this comfortable period

The shoe is amazing running on hard pavement My knees do not hurt after running

I bought these sneakers because of all the great reviews and sneaker of the year awards from multiple web sites The sneaker is very good looking however it is nearly impossible to get your foot into it The length is perfect but it is just simply too tight for the average man to get his foot into Quite frankly I would think it would be hard for any female to get her foot into it And for the people who say it fits like a sock I recommend you get new socks because you are probably cutting off the circulation in your foot Again great looking sneaker but avoid at all costs

The Adidas ultra boost shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever had I am a long and triple jumper and this shoe makes me feel so light and bouncy as if i were running and jumping on clouds If you ever want to send any gear i will be more than happy to accept it

These are the best shoes that I have owned in my life I have owned other brands These were my first pair of Adidas in 20 years The last 5 purchases since this one have been Boosts Nothing compares to this cushioning

The greatest runing shoe everTrue It is Period The only great problem I see with these are if you are rockin them slick white ultra boost and they get dirty I do not know how to clean it HELP ME

I have three pair of the ultra boost shoes and its my favorite shoe out right now They look awesome and are one of the most comfortable shoes ever I run a lot and have used them to train in but I just do not like messing them up

I got a size 9 but am going to get a 9 5 when they restock But that being said I am keeping the size 9 I got I will recommend them to people

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had These were the 1st pair of Adidas I have had in 20 years TWENTY I have always been getting Nikes and the last 5 shoes I have bought were the other colorways of this shoe

It us SOOOO comfortable Makes me realize how my comfort standard have been so low for so long

I get compliments all the time I was kind of shocked by that because I usually wear Jordanand stuff and these shoes get the most compliments They run very small tho I have read reviews that said they run big that is very false in my case I wear a 10 10 5 in Nike I have wide feet and the 11 5 fits perfect I love these shoes and they are very comfortable Better than any other shoe I have worn

The ultra boosts are one of my favorite shows Very comfortable and look amazing Recommend this product to everyone

Just got my pair in and they are amazing My little brother just got a pair and he loves them as well We both have slightly wide feet and all shoes do not accommodate us but these are fine width wise tight out of the box across the midfoot area but all I had to do was loosen the laces slightly

I am a high school cross country track runner going around 30 miles a week I was skeptical in buying adidas for distance running but I was impressed for the first few weeks After a while though they started to feel too narrow and my toes started hurting Not sure how this could be fixed but I would love to see an ultra boost 2 with a wider sole Overall a good shoe though

I have been a runner for a while starting in high school playing lacrosse and these are by far the best running shoes that I have owned Many other brands have tried to achieve lightweight shoes that are also durable and have failed Adidas came through with comfortable light shoes that are durable under use Highly recommend

I have ordered two pairs one white and one gray They are awesome shoes to wander around the city on a dry day taking a run at the gym or to just have on around the house or office They look hella good too

Swapped the laces for 3M laces

I love these shoes they look and feel great it is like walking on clouds Running is so much better with the ultra boost Te amo adidas Be mine on Valentine 

While the price can run some people away I can tell you with all confidence that this shoe is quality at its best I did not have any issues with this running shoe It feels great and performs better the boost technology offers only the best comfort the shoe is durable with a look that supports the shoe through where ever you go I would highly recommend this shoe this is a must have for any serious runner trust me you get what you pay for

The most comfortable shoes ever Although they might be too snug I suggest ordering half a size down

They run true to size and really have nothing they need to change I have been looking for a good running shoe for the longest and I think search is now over

Ultra boost are the most comfortable runners I have owned Best runners hands down

I personally really enjoy this shoe I use it not just for running but for everyday travel it goes with almost everything and he prime knit and boost tech combo is a work of genius I have a wider foot and I would recommend that you go a half size up if you do too

good good

it is will be more comfortable if they have wide sizes

The shoe fits very snug which I am a personal fan of However the snug fit is not for everyone I like everything about the shoe no issues Just be aware that they do fit very snug because of the primeknit upper

Absolutely remarkable shoe feels like your Dell Beckham in any situation best shoe ive came across and im on my feet all day everyday with that ups

These shoes are just amazing Not only do they look good they also are super comfortable However the price is a bit steep on these but the comfort just makes it so worth every penny The primeknit on the new Continental version gets fuzzy real quick so just be aware of that Also do not forget to pull the tongue and the heel tab when putting these on because I accidentally ripped something in the shoe to which I can not seem to find lolme Anyways these are definitely a MUST COP shoe

The sole last longer

They are narrow they run 1 2 a size big to your gender The boost technology is impressive I have the all white colorway and this shoe turns heads The sole holds up the rest of the shoe and I really like the material on the top of the shoe The laces are very soft and all around it is a great shoe for all of the seasons Adidas you had people turning heads last year and I have been saying 2016 is your year

This is the most comfortable shoe I have even put on my feet They fit very narrow so if your feet are anything but narrow you might want to size up Your best bet is to go try on a pair of them on in a store

I am happy

most comfortable shoe i ever worn the boost technology feels like your not stepping on the ground cant wait to see what in store in the future for boost shoes

I like the way it fit and very comfy for running

I have been buying Air Jordanand Nikes for nearly 2 decades that could be coming to an end The Ultra Boost could is the most comfortable shoe I have ever tried on The hype is real

The ultra boost does not only look great on feet it is super comfortable

I wear these because I want cushion These are not minimalist shoes it is for someone who wants cushion I feel I have to repeat that again because who complain are not understanding the purpose of the shoe The shoe is my go to shoe if I want to run on the treadmill run outside train at the gym and while I do errands on the weekend I have 5 pairs and have stopped wearing other brands The UBs are extremely comfortable and because I rotate between several of them I have not seen the wear and tear that some have complained about

Obviously there is a bunch of hype behind this shoe Took me about a year to catch it stocked in my size and it definitely lives up to the hype and then some

The ultra boost is a very comfortable shoe and the small white color way just makes it even better

Great pair of shoes

This shoe is extremely comfortable like walking on a slice of soft pillow Ive worn them for 10 hours straight before and my feet were extremely comfortable the entire 10 hours Strongly recommend for runners or anyone looking for a comfortable everyday shoe

One of the best runner I have ever owned I would highly recommend

I have worn all kinds of Nikes from flyknits to airmaxes and none compare to the comfort level of this shoe The primaknit makes it feel like you have nothing on while the boost sole adds to the comfort Continental Streatchweb gives unbelievable traction Not only are these shoes comfortable but also look great so you can rock them anytime I was skeptical at first but truly am sold after wearing these for a few days Run a bit small so I would recommend half a size up

Adidas is the best can not wear any other non ultra boost shoes

AVID RUNNER FOR YEARS LOOKING FOR A CUSHIONY SHOE THAT DIDNT FEEL LIKE IM EVEN WEARING SHOES I FOUND THESE AND RAN IN THEM AND FELL IN LOVE ABSOLUTELY BUT AFTER MY SECOND RUN IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE MATERIAL ON THE TOP IS STARTING TO FRAY A THREAD AT THE TOP CAME LOOSE ON THE LEFT SHOE TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOE DEBATING ON WHAT TO DO FOR THE PRICE I FEEL I SHOULD RETURN THEM BUT IS THIS BOUND TO HAPPEN DUE TO THE MATERIAL

It is super comfortable with the prime knit and the boost never goes out which I love

I have never ever left a review on a product until today when I got these as was so amazed just how conformable they are it like your walking on clouds it is amazing I am wearing these as much as I can never wear same shoes 2 days in a row before these I wore them for 4 days straight I 100 guarantee you will be happy with these I am buying the all white ones as well

it is the best shoes

This shoes is perfect for me its not only a running shoes but it is one of the best sneaker of all time I felt so comfortable and happy when wearing this running sneaker everyday I highly recommend it worth each penny

I own 3 pairs and at the same spot on every pair where my big toe touches the knit material is starting to unravel A hole is in the making It sucks because it is a very comfortable shoes I just wish that the top material is a little bit sturdier

it is like adidas went to a cloud ripped a piece off and made into a shoe xe2 x98 x81 xef xb8 x8f xe2 x98 x81 xef xb8 x8f xe2 x98 x81 xef xb8 x8f

I went to a specialty running store in order to buy some new running shoes I tried on shoes from every brand they had and when I put on the Ultra Boost I knew they were the one for me The comfort is unreal The upper fits just like a sock and the boost midsole is cushioned yet not mushy I went on a 11 mile run straight out of the box No break in at all required although you do have to be careful about not lacing too tightly The plastic frame will definitely dig into your foot if you lace tightly The good fabulous comfort without losing ground feel These are cushioned and responsive at the same time which I thought was impossible There is one HUGE negative though I have literally been on two runs with these shoes I grand total of 18 miles The nubs on the sole are at least half way gone and I am guessing when they are all the way gone the traction will take quite a hit Not exactly what I need in an Ohio winter Adidas is there any plan to modify the material the nubs are made out of I love these shoes EXCEPT showing wear at 18 miles is just not acceptable I am not a pro or extra hard on shoes by any means 51 yrs old 6 0 178 lbs approximately 30 miles per week

Even though the shoe was a little pricey I was very pleased with my purchase The shoe offers a great style for running or just the casual trip out The color I received navy matches well with most outfits The neon green aglets became my favorite design feature of the shoe and the boost material makes the running experience top notch

These ultra boost are the most perfect shoes ever Great fit AMAZING cushioning and the upper is unbelievably awesome You can run in these look good in these casually and workout in these What more can you want Best shoes ever The only shoe I have been wearing since I got them Super Durable too The only con is the outsole however Other than that they are perfect

After hearing so many good things about this shoe I had to get my hands on a pair I could not believe how comfy they were I have been a sneaker head for a long time and never experienced anything like this from any other brand It was like walking with memory foam on your feet Now if you could make a waterproof boost for the NW that would be amazing

Boost is one of the most amazing cushioning systems I have ever experienced This colorway is clean and eye catching

I am not a runner I work a manual labor job anywheres from 60 to 84 hours a week I own 60 pairs of shoes I had been wanting to try the ultra boosts for awhile but was putting it off I finally ordered a pair and as soon as I put them on I immediately ordered another pair I now own four pairs of ultra boosts and they have become my go to favorite shoe They are so comfortable I have worn every kind of shoe and sole combination on the market Most shoes with the latest and greatest technology I personally could almost never feel a difference until I put on an ultra boost This shoe really may be in my opinion the greatest shoe ever made So if your debating on buying a pair take the plunge it is worth it

Best purchase I have ever made Fits true to size and the primeknit upper fits your foot exactly like a sock The boost midsole is the most responsive thing I have ever run in the energy return into my stride is ridiculous I over pronate and have flat feet so I have been running in stability shoes for a long time but I feel like this help correct my pronation issues naturally without a big bulky forceful medial post The boost midsole works with your feet and adapt to your natural stride to boost your run and it works

I recommend this shoe to anyone and this shoe is for people that understand what comfort is all about because this shoe actually cares for your feet and I own 3 pairs and still planning on buying more everyone should own at least one of these

Bought these for the actual shoe not the hype behind it and it is amazing

The shoes are absoutely unrea Very stylish Always getting compliments

Went a half size up from a 10 5 to 11 but this shoe is unbelievably comfortable and I made the right decision Yeezy taught me well this shoe is like walking on a clouds

If you are looking a comfortable sneaker this is the shoe to get

The off white and white combination could not have been executed more perfectly than this Great job on really making this shoe stand out The technology behind it speaks volumes I have not been this excited about a Adidas release since the shell toes and Xenos

I can not praise the Ultra Boost enough I now have 4 pairs and they are my ultimate go to favorite shoe I wear them casually but sometimes I am on my feet as long as 8 12 hours in a day I have done this in the Ultra Boost and can honestly say the comfort is A I have owned hundreds of shoes as I have been collecting since 2002 but have never owned a shoe this comfortable by any brand

at first i was skeptical and thought the price was too much but let me say these things are worth well over retail Absolutely amazing

I bought my pair of Ultra Boost back in April and now have over 300 miles on them The shoes have far exceed expectations I have been running exclusively in adidas boost products for over two years now When these were coming out for release I was a little bit skeptical mainly due to the price I got to run a couple of test miles in a pair of ultras and quickly realized it was the real deal shoe

shoe is great and has a lot of durability for the pull it has on the fashion world

They are great shoes i walk miles on campus everyday and they feel amazing They look great worn in the mall or the gym

it is like putting on snug slippers They feel great and run great I am surprised that they do not breath better but overall a solid running shoe

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They do fit a little tight but because of the knit material making it more of a sock feel I would recommend going a half size up for more room but overall these shoes are amazing and very stylish as well

This shoes is so comfortable I had to buy it in two colorways I recently bought some air max 15 prior to buying my first ultra boost in solar red The boost are way more comfortable to run in than the air max I recently picked up some ultra boost in a core black colorway when the website had my size available and I have to say the primeknit material feels a lot different than the primeknkt material on my solar reds I am not sure if I got a defective pair but other than that it is still a nice shoe They also look great so you can wear them with almost anything

These shoes are really good My feet do not hurt at all They are super comfy Very light on my feet I would definitely buy them again

Adidas has done a great job with this shoe It grips and fits my foot so I feel confident while running and looks great

You feel like you are walking in the clouds I use them to work since i have to be standing the whole day Really comfortable My husband has them in 5 different colors already He uses them to go to the gym

I only wore Asics Gel Nimbus forever but on a whim I purchased these shoes These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Hands down I typically run 3 5 miles 3 times a week it is a breeze in these shoes And they are super comfy for just walking around

Ultra Boost shoes fit like a glove and have been perfect for all workouts in the gym I have used my pair indoor for about six months and there is no sign of wear at all They grip perfectly on the slickest wood floor during weight training They fit like part of the body and perhaps the most important point is that they are not noticed while running on the treadmill it is as though they are part of you Hardly any weight Added bounce Best workout shoes ever

My son and I walked by a new Adidas shoe store in the mall and decided to go in He was looking for a new pair of running walking shoes and was trying some on the sales person was telling us about these new shoes Ultra Boost shoes and here exclusive Adidas soles and tops that are so comfortable it is like walking on air and they boost you while running My son was ready to leave but I tried the shoes on and convinced him to also We did not take them off and wore them home I am on my feet all day and I love these shoes Probably the best shoes I have ever owned PI was wearing a new pair of New Balance running shoes when we went into the store

I love the shoe Very comfortable and you can really feel the energy return Only draw back is that i feel my heel slipping out when doing my runs had to remove the insole for my foot to go deeper in the the shoe and for my heel not to slip out

This pair of shoes are insanely comfortable You can walk all day and feel no discomfort on your feet Definitely recommend this model

1 for Me

MOST COMFORTABLE SNEAKER EVER I just wish they had more black and white in stock

Very comfortable and good design

These by far are the best shoes i have ever owned great cushioning that allows me to be on my feet walking around all day for my job with ease

I own 5 pairs of Ultra Boosts are these shoes are extremely comfortable shoes whether they are used for running or everyday highly recommend these

This running shoe has to be one the most underrated running shoe A perfect mix of weight cushion and comfort

When I first put them on they felt a bit snug but they are designed to be that way I am a sz 11 5 12 depending on the sneaker and the 12 works fine for me They just mold to your foot after a few hours and I have not wanted to take them off my feet since I own at least 100 pairs of sneakers and these are in the top 3 as far as comfort and they look great

I am an avid runner and I am always in the gym In the streets of NYC or in the gym I can not say I have ever been more satisfied with a running shoe I use these sneakers for all my fitness activity energy return is great tie down is great

the prime knit upper is just so soft and formfitting and the boost midsole is so responsive yet plush the best running shoes ever 

Since experiencing the Energy boost adidas and the flyknit lunar 3 nike i have to say that the boost foam in this shoe feels much better in the Energy boost and the would Rose 5 I must say that the Boost provided a better energy return then the lunarlon in the flyknit lunar 3 I have to say that my favorite feature of the shoe is for sure the Primeknit Compared to the Flyknit it was pretty much the same They are both elastic form fitting uppers that did their job I must say that the lock down in the Ultra boosts was a little bit better because of the TPU heal counter for that heal lockdown what Nike did with the flynkit lunar 3 they made the flyknit tighter in the heal area and they have flywire too I gotta say that i like the Flyknit lunar 3 more as a runner just because of the low to the ground feel that the Lunarlon provides I would wear the Ultra Boosts casually more because they are FIRE Plus Kayne wore them

I wanted to wait 4 months before posting my review to understand the durability and all I can say is WOW I have put down very long mile runs and also interval training varying from 100m 800m pseudo sprints and these shoes are great Very comfortable and the comfort does not diminish in time

for the most part these look and feel awesome especially as a fashion shoe albeit a pricey one I wear them often for quick jaunts and everyday tasks The fit is true to size for me but it is definitely narrow but will break in with frequent use I do not recommend them for anything over 5k unless you are doing slower tempo runs Because of the bountiful boost and pronounced heel jaunt I had very acute ankle and knee pains when I tried to run at longer pace runs with these Went back to my Adistar Boosts and and that alleviated most of that pain

This shoe is brilliant Extremely comfortable and even more stylish I have trouble finding a good fit as I have a narrow 12 13 menshoe size The shoe does fit narrowly but in my case it is nothing short of perfect I got a 13 but a 12 5 my true size may have fit even more perfectly I have the triple white and it is beautiful and I get compliments and looks from friends and strangers alike Highly recommended Spend the extra 80 bucks and be happy and better than all your Nike wearing peers

Most comfortable shoes ever but go a half size up because they are a bit narrow Length wise they are fine though

its a really nice shoe but the only downside is the traction but that is it I know the 2 is they make it will be better as long as they fix the traction issue But I love them I prefer the pure boost for walking but the ultraboost for any work out

This shoe technology I would wonderful feels like your walking on the moon Only huge problem for wide foot people of the world Fitting a size 10 my size was like trying to fit The Big Show in a toy car

I can not complain about the shoequality comfort looks or anything else for that matter besides it is narrow fit I love the shoe but it does run vary narrow In my opinion

I really like the shoe I am already onto my second pair Only negative point I would have is that the nodes on the bottom of the sole tends to show wear quickly I have used other Adidas boost shoes and the soles did not show wear quickly so not sure what is going on with this shoe But like i said i am already into my second pair so not too big a problem for me

This shoe fits perfect and it feels as good on day 500 as it did on day 1 it is amazingly comfortable

It has a great feel with a breathable upper and the heel has enough support to feel great while running

I purchased these because of the good reviews of ultra boost cushioning I am a 6 2 200lb soccer player and need a cushioned ride for running These definitely fit the bill Primarily buy Adidas soccer shoes but love these for running No shin splints from any indoor outdoor runs yet No break in required Wore them a few hours around the house before my first run and no blisters ever Rare from my experience

I have been running for two years now and have not found a better shoe than this I run 10 miles a day in these on rock asphalt track and sand Perfect for wherever you run My dad has 10 pairs of these He has been running for 40 years and has only missed 24 days of running since then He also says that these are the best shoes he has ever run in They hold up to the 16 miles he puts on them everyday We will never buy anything but adidas boost again

I love the feel of these shoes but the Adidas line runs very narrow and has become more so I am a female and have to buy from the menline because the womenseries it way too narrow for my foot I was extremley happy with the Boost 6 series but the 7s are narrower and less comfortable I hope Adidas will work on this aspect because they make a superior shoe but the width leaves out a significant portion of the running population When a woman who can normally wear a wide shoe from virtually any running shoe company feels stifled by a menregular size there is a problem Adidas please offer better widths

I have been forcing myself to become a runner I hate it Until I tried these shoes The are very responsive and absorb a lot of impact For the first time in my life my feet were not the first part of my body to fatigue they are the last The do wrap your entire foot and that took a bit getting use to Thanks to them my training has greatly improved

Amazing shoe I love the feel and comfortability

The Ultra Boost is easily the best overall shoe in the market Easily more comfortable and cushioned than Lunarlon Micro etc The Ultra Boost has a perfect mix of firmness but responsiveness You are not sinking into the shoe but it is very bouncy The Primeknit material is also much more form fitting than Flyknit I will buy more pairs in the future

I bought a pair of these pre release and was very pleased when they arrived I own 3 other Adidas boost series shoes Theses Ultra Boost look very nice and are very light The major flaw that I see with them is that they are not a true fit They fit very tightly especially around the areas of the arch of the feet It has a form fitting inner section which is very tight with no adjustments possible To say the least I am very disappointed after spending so much money on a pair of shoes that do not fit

I have worn 12for a long time and I have only had to size down to an 11 or 11 5 maybe once or twice This is the first shoe I have gotten that I will need to half size up to 12 5 My foot fits in it fine length wise but the shoe is very narrow around the toes at least for me making the shoe too tight around the toes

I have put 18 miles on these shoes Six 3 miles runs 2 on treadmills and 4 outside I am very impressed with the shock absorption so far hope they stay this way for a long time The upper is fantastic Super comfortable with good room in the toe box My previous shoes Boost ESM really hurt the top of my feet due to a poorly constructed tongue have not done any speed work yet on these but am looking forward to it I must say that these do tend to run a little long I normally get a 10 5 US but these definitely run alittle long Width is spot on I will up the mileage on these in time I have had 5 knee surgeries on left knee and shock absortion is of paramount importance to me I must say that it is a real pleasure to run in a shoe that absorbs shock without feeling like a marshmallow It is awesome on my aging knees A suggestion though The removable sockliner really needs a more pronounced arch i wil replace the the ones that came with these when I do longer runs Overall really pleased Maybe drop the price a tad but Great job Adidas

I love the Boost series I have bought many pairs and no longer even consider another brand Everything I could ask for in a shoe

These have been my most expensive pair of running shoes I have bought to date I have two pairs of Boston Boosts and Supernova Glide 7 and decided to try these out alongside They fit very comfortably have excellent grip on pavement and are good for walking light running

Most comfortable runners i have At first wear they are a little tight but once you loosen the laces and wear them for a little bit they are super comfy Awesome kicks

I love these shoes like them as soon as I tried them on Best energy return and the comfort WOW Just do not last the sole is what needs to be addressed before I buy another pair I have recommend to a few friends but with a disclaimer

After owning the Pure Boost I could not wait to wear these Ultra Boost Super comfortable and more stable than the Pure Boost better for running I will be curious how well the fabric mesh material holds up Would definitely recommend

Love the shoe Wish they offered in a wide fit

Adidas has a winner here Excellent balance of softness and responsiveness Very comfortable

The Yeezy Affect

Order 1 2 size larger for more comfort wear

This is my 3rd pair of Ultra Boost I just wanted different colors I love the seamless design and added cushion in these I have been using the Ultra Boost for regular training days as well as long runs and so far they have not let me down My only comment would be to make a thicker rubber sole maybe use the Continental rubber like the Supernova

REALLY NICE SHOE FITS REALLY WELL PERFECT FUR RUNNING HOLDS YOUR FOOT REALLY NICE AND TIGHT

It is one of the best shoes if not the best shoe I have ever purchased It is a really unique feel The upper does not have any structureit what so ever The only thing holding your foot in place is the heel counter and the three stripes soft synthetic that are located on the midfoot Despite the minimal structure they hold your foot securely in place impresivelly well They might feel a little bit unconfortable for the first few hours of wearing time but after some time you will get used to the new feel and the primeknit upper will mold to fit your foot After your first twothree days of wearing there will be no extra space between the upper and your foot

This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing and comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life This shoe is fashion forward and is worn by many of the biggest celebreties such as Kanye West The fit is nice and snug and when you walk it feels like a cloud The primeknit technology is very advanced and the intriquite weaving of the shoe is a work of art Minimal branding on the shoe because the superior design speaks for itself This is a great casual shoe to add to your daily rotation

Base LineYou will never ever regret this purchase and i am sure you will miss them if you are not wearing yours

When I bought the Pure Boost a year or so ago I was pretty disappointed I wanted to like them but they were just so narrow Also they were comfortable but not very stable I was rolling my ankles all day

The Ultra Boost are extremely comfortable it is like walking on rubber clouds The Primeknit is stretchy and comfortable The shoe does fit narrow as I had to size 5 up even wearing extremely thin socks

Any shoe that feels this amazing has to be bad for you Thank god Adidas does not make food

It is not an understatement to say these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Bouncy but not too much with a perfect stretch fit with the durable Primeknit and extremely breathable fabric The souls are grippy rubber and durable These are perfect urban running and street shoes On point styling

it is the greatest running shoes ever made What I like about this shoes is the combination of primeknit and boost technology that best compliment each other You will never get wrong with that combination but others say the price is a little bit pricey compared to other running shoes The price does not matter if you can have the best of both worlds First it is the most comfortable shoes for running second it is very versatile because you can be very stylish and trendy while wearing this shoes I am looking forward for more ultra boost colorways and boost products

I do not know how someone wouldnt like this shoe Its comfortable stylish and lightweight Its been my go to travel shoe and its easy to wear since it goes with almost everything Definetly recommend giving it a try

I wanted to like these shoes I really did For starters i think the boost cushioning is absolutely amazing probably the best cushioning out in the market The prime knit is also very lightweight and breathable What really hold this shoe back from being amazing is the lacing system and the upper in general There is no end hole to secure a tight fit which almost every running shoe out there has The fatal flaw of these shoes is the lacing system It uses hard plastic on the sides to reinforce the shoe which is a god awful idea When laced up the hard plastic hugs the side of your feet to death and allow literally no room for your foot to expand This leads to extreme amounts of pain in the side of the feet I cant loosen up the laces without losing a barely snug fit These shoes are also very narrow I bumped up a full size and my wide feet were still bulging out The cushioning is great but the lacing system just makes these shoes unwearable

These shoes are really comfortable I love everything except the outsole The outsole wears out quickly It also makes the shoes slippery on wet surface

Love the shoe overall however the sole is poorly made first it sounds like youre wearing spikes when walking around on indoor surfaces second when the surface is wet there is absolutely no traction i was planning on going for a jog in my neighborhood after it rained and ended up slipping multiple times on concrete surfaces i definitely hope that the UB 2 0 gets a sole upgrade

let us get straight to the point I fell for the hype let us break it down

I mean Kanye wore them Does anything else need to be said These are the Goat of shoes behind actually yeezys

I do a minimum of three miles a day and do a max of miles These shoe have been great for it and really comfortable

Quality is horrible Would not buy another Adidas product especially this one How can a running shoes have its sole worn out within a monthThis is outrageous

Interesting show and very versatile everyday running and trainer

I find the Adidas Energy Boost line to offer the most support of any running shoe out there The Ultra Boost provides the same support and cushion but with a lighter signature that not only makes for greater comfort for training but also for casual wear as well

I like the appearance fit and quality of workmanship I do feel some energy return after each stride but I want more My feet are size 11 1 2 but I weigh only 155 so the shoe foundation is too stiff for my low weight When I jump up six inches and land flat footed on a concrete floor I do feel a rebound but not enough to lift the sole off the ground My runs are good but not significantly better than with my other running shoes and therefore the higher cost is a drawback The shoes are very comfortable for both walking and running and I did not have any problems with them after several runs

The prime knit upper gives a one to one fit on your foot that cant be matched by any other shoe and boost is still the best cushioning set up ive ever felt It does not hurt that they look great too

One of the best shoes I have found in a long time Super comfortable Looking into buying another pair

Adidas always fit true to size These were no different feels great with a very neutral feel Well cushioned and seems to propel you forward as you roll off your foot Function feel wise I have no complaints However they look like those custom made orthopedic shoes when you have them on They have an odd shape especially the back that sticks out past the heel makes you look like a grandpa wearing comfort ortho shoes They look great in pics but on the foot it is a different story Just too big and clunky looking Too bad

Shoes were good except that the plastic stripes on the side bruised my foot Would prefer cloth stripes in a shoe that is built out of a comfortable well fitting knit Had to send back as I could not wear due to pain because of the plastic stripes Would recommend these if the stripes do not bother your feet as they are soft and fit well Please get rid of plastic stripes

It feels like your walking on clouds

I purchased these shoes for exercise purposes but i am by no means a runner But I do have bad knees from playing football in the past and still enjoy exercising I never thought that a shoe could be a solution for my knees during squats lunges jumps etc but I can say with confidence if your in a similar position as myself and are looking for a COMFORTABLE shoe for daily weight training This is the model for you Side note however I have only owned these for 1 week I am curious to see durability I hear a lot of horror stories

have not been wearing them long but so far very comfortable light and easiest on the knees that i have ever tried I have knee problems will need knee replacement in the next few years but these will help me to put it off longer

THIS IS THE BEST

This is my second pair of the Ultra Boosts I previously bought the black ones and fell in love I am not much of a runner but I do walk a ton at my job Whether it is running or walking you will not want to take them off

I purchased these shoes knowing that I would not be running 10to 100of miles them I purchased them because I needed a great gym shoe with good stability and extreme comfort along with responsiveness so I do not feel like I am dragging my feet through molasses This shoe is the most fantastic shoe I have ever owned This shoe actually makes me want to go on longer runs The Boost Foam is not a gimmick it is an amazing midsole that outperforms anything else I have ever run in based on responsiveness and because it is uber comfortable The upper the adidas Primeknit is also a major reason why this shoe is so comfortable and breathable It stretches and flexes and does anything you want but will always go back to its beginning position The shoe is a bootie type shoe fit which adds to its crazy comfort It feels like wearing an awesome sock The Stretchweb outsole is also great It has held up great so far with minimal wear The only downside to this shoe is the super high price tag but it is pretty reasonable when you look at what really went into the research and development of this shoe I love it

Being a owner of the original Energy Boosts and Energy Boosts 2 ESM model shoes the Ultra Boosts are a dramatic upgrade from it is predecessors First off the mesh uppers are breathable snug and supportive without being as tight in the toe box area as the original Energy Boosts In other words the Ultra Boosts are true to size

I really like this pair of shoes I had one but I would like to buy for my friend but i already go back Taiwan Could you help to assist sent to TaiwanBut free shipping valid on domestic Uorders only so if have to send to Taiwan how much should i pay

Just got a pair of the Ultras and overall they are very nice looking in person The knit material is more robust than I expected but has some stretch to it It is woven to allow little openings so you can actually see through it a bit The heel material is also more stiff than expected

I have had the shoe for about a month I really want to love this shoe but it is just to narrow Blister on my little toe with no relief with thin socks or band aids To late to return I guess I wear a medium width shoe in all other brands

Best shoe ever

I am a big fan and I love the Boost Collection I own 3 pairs 2 Energies Boston Boost These by far are the best shoes right now They are sleek comfortable light and def ultra cushiony it is like walking on bouncy clouds

Absolutely the most comfortable shoes for me EVER My feet smile whenever I put these on and run I loved my Energy Boost 2 but these are a whole order of magnitude more comfy

One wordHeavenly Wow I know 2 words could not help it Most comfortable runner I have ever worn Out of box slipped in my foot beds busted out an enthusiastic 4mi and now I do not want to take them off

Its look like comfortable from the fist wear but after a while you will start to feel how narrow it is and you will got the pain after that

I have been a runner for 15 years and prior to this did not run in Adidas I met with the Adidas rep at my running store in Boulder CO and agreed to give these a chance I was and continue to be very impressed This are amazing runners and I can feel the boost material spring back on every step I was able to run on snow ice trails and obviously pavement I plan on picking up other colorways and these will probably become my default runners

Received in the mail today after ordering from the adidas website Just finished my first run 4 5 miles The shoes fit my foot better than the Boost and I think I will be a fan of the tongeless you Boost Definitely a sock like fit During the run my toes got really numb I am attributing part of that to the fact that they are fresh out of the box and I need to break them in a bit throughout the course of several runs So I will have to report back after a week or so

At first the price tag almost made me skip this inaugural launchbut with all the awesome reviews coming in I had to jump in And I have not regretted it since Best Boost and runners I have ever purchased I even started to wear this daily for work where I am traveling on my feet a lot The only criticism I have is regarding the nubs on the soles As some folks have already pointed out they do wear out faster than one would think I was a little suprised with this especially after hearing that this Stretchweb layer is basically the same material as rubber tires so they should last for some time But that is not what I am noticing I hope Adidas fixes this on version 2 0 Otherwise this is a killer runner Oh and LOVE the Primeknit Boost combo and to have it available for the general public unlike the initial ultra limited ultra difficult to purchase Primeknits

I also wish Adidas would make the boost foam in colors other than white as it is hard to keep clean Give them a try you will love them

Extremely comfortable shoe and I love the knit material It fits so well on your foot 2 downsides though I feel like there is not enough support on the shoe I have flat feet so I need an extremely supportive shoe and I have noticed after about 3 weeks some stitching has come out Overall great shoe and great looking shoe

In the words of the Lego MovieEverything is AWESOME

Purchased the shoes during the general release and did a 6 mi and 20 mi city run in them at an8min mi pace I can not lie they are comfy and felt nice but after my run I noticed EXCESSIVE wear on the soles in comparison to a pair of the Glide Boosts The pavement shredded the black treads For a product at this premium price point I would hope they last long enough to train and RUN THE ACTUAL RACE YOU are TRAINING FOR At this rate the soles will be bald in a month

I have been waiting for this shoe for weeks read all the reviews and hype videos and they finally show up I do not think I could be more disappointed in a shoe than I am right now I think all the hype over this shoe plays a big role in my disappointment

I purchased the ultra boost as I was curious about how they would hold up in a run I run about 20 miles a week I wore the shoe all day to kinds get used to wearing them and then wore them on my morning run the next day Took about 3 miles to get used to running with them on They were comfortable but not the most comfortable I suppose I currently love running in minimalist so the added comfort kinda bothered me Super comfy shoe to wear by far

could not be happier with these Very comfortable just the right amount of cushion

Fantastic shoe in so many regards Fit well comfortable great cushioning But I agree with other reviews here that the wear is through the roof it is nice and grippy but compared to the continental sole on my normal boosts these just evaporate Whereas I would normally get 2 months out of a pair I have had these a week and they are just about toast already This does need addressing The only fault though this aside they are remarkable

Ultra nice shoe Runs very large Boost is very comfty More colors please

The Boost continues to improve as it is the most comfortable shoe ever

Much better forefront cushioning than previous generations of the boost lineup They feel as consistent for indoor runs as they do for cold outdoor weather runs If your looking for a soft neutral ride get the ultra boost

This is one of the most comfortable running shoes I have run in My only concern is the durability of the stretchweb outsole After less than 10 miles many of the tread bumps are almost worn off Within the next 2 weeks I will monitor this carefully and determine whether or not I need to return them per the 30 day return policy

First this shoe is amazing Im an ex collegiate and athlete with a neutral gate and forefoot midfoot runner I am approx 200lbs and need a cushioned ride I have been looking forever for a shoe with enough fore mid foot cushioning for the heavier neutral runner and I feel as though everything is focused on Heel cushioning these days but this is amazing for the mid forefoot striker Extremely cushioned and soft yet responsive feels great on the foot needed two days to break the shoe in and no injuries since I have had them You do not want to take these babies off believe the hype I almost missed out on a great shoe

Most comfortable shoes I have ever had

This shoe feels great when I run They feel so comfortable and make my run fun

I like the way this shoe fits because I do not experience heel slip like I do in other shoes However I did find it seemed I was using more effort in my runs with these shoes compared to my Supernova Glide 7s

I want to start with the fit since that was what I was most concerned with before I bought them Every athletic adidas shoe I have ever bought has been too narrow and I usually buy a half size up or a full size up I bought these in a half size up and it fits fine I am interested to know what a full size up feels like but I must admit these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Great for running If I could afford it I would buy ten pairs

Adidas has done it again What a winning formula other brands need to take notes Me feet and I thank you

I have been wearing the boost shoes ever since I tried them on in the store and felt like I found the magic slipper These are expensive shoes but feel my feet are worth it This new model is a bit harder to slip on my foot but then again having a tongue that does not move has its advantages we well Now I only wish there were more colors

The most amazing running shoes ever It is exquisite I could actually run more with it More workout time I loooooooove it Looks good And plus it is worn by the biggest stars in sports

I have had two pair of Boost prior to these which I really loved However when I slipped these on I could instantly tell that they were a lot more comfortable I love running in these They have the spring that the Boost are known for but with extreme comfort Love them

I have been running in Boost for several years now The new Ultra is superior in every way The original Boost was to narrow The fit is excellent and I have shaved time off of my runs I am training for the Boston Marathon now and just purchased a second pair for the event

I am a Special Operations Solider and a routine weight lifter This shoes makes me feel a least 10 lbs lighter awesome shoe for a heavier runner

I am buying another pair when there are more color choices

I have been a big fan of the boost line since it arrived on the market and the Ultra Boost are no exception At first when I tried them on I thought they were too small but once you start running in them they contour to your foot It does take some getting used too but the break in time is very quick They do run true to size I did not have to order a larger size like I had too with the original Boost or Boost 2 0 I did find the Ultra Boost less clunky feeling I am a heel striker and the transition from heel strike through the gait cycle to toe off was super smooth The fit is really nice It is snug but allows more flex than the original Boost or Boost 2 0 I noticed a great improvement in the traction The Boost return on these are incredible As I became tired on a long run the return energy really helped a lot and I found my self not having to struggle as much as I became more tired as my run went on There is a definite improvement in the cushioning It is a softer ride like the Supernova Boost 7 and Response Boost but it is not squishy or too firm Seems like they nailed it just right Are these the best running shoe ever that is up for you to decide what I can say is that the Ultra Boost is going to be very difficult for the competition to beat I read in some other reviews that the heel was not comfortable I did not encounter any discomfort at all I will be using these for my regular trainers and for an up coming 3K run The materials have a nice sturdy feel to them I only have a few nit pick negatives The laces are thin in width I wish they were wider like the Supernova Boost 7 how ever it did not hinder performance at all Next is the steep price It would have been nice if there was a more friendly price tag on the Ultra Boost or maybe include a free Boostshirt or carry bag

These shoes out of the box recquire no break in time immediately out of the box and are immediately comfortable I have owned 5 pairs of ultraboosts over the years and I certainly will not stop buying them anytime soon

Great shoe all around my son loves them He is a runner and thinks not only do they look good but fit perfect

Other than being 1 2 size to small these sneakers beat just about any sneakers I have purchased in comfort If you want a nice looking pair of sneaker that are extra comfortable then you will love these

These shoes not only look good they are super comfy I got them as a birthday gift for my husband and he loves them He told me he gets so many compliments and they feel good on his feet He is a sneaker head so if I was able to empress him with my pick of shoes for him they must really be the real deal

Quality the design and colors are outstanding Highly recomended

If you like a classic design this is a great show I always want to love the Iniki 5923and they look great in pictures but when the shoe arrives it is disappointingly flimsy with very shoddy materials This shoe is a similar look and design but with upgraded mesh and other materials feels more solid I am desperately waiting for more colors to come out can not recommend enough

The product page says these are made from mesh and synthetic suede but the actual label on the shoe says they are made from cow suede This is super annoying for people who avoid leather and purchase these based on the incorrect website information

Had to cop these Love how they mixed so many different Js for these retros Match with a bunch of outfits Got them for the whole fam Got the OGs back in 07 and they look exactly the same to me

Finishline was able to satisfy my need at the time so I purchased from them

It was nice deal I am totally satisfied

I like the way they look on me and there very comfortable the colors match with almost anything I wear definitely official

This Oreo spizikes are really good their cool I would highly recomend to other

These Jare one of my favorite pairs I like that they have a little bit of four classic Jordans in one shoe Sick kicks

Good overall shoe goes very good with jeans Comfortable however does require some breaking in If you are looking for a nice shoe good for almost any casual occasion you will not be disappointed with these Jordan Spizike

This was a great addition to his collection

I like the color and the style of it I wish the tongues were made of a harder material but other than that it is a pretty dope shoe

My son loves these sneakers These are his favorite Jordanso when he asked for them for Christmas I was glad that I could purchase them for him knowing it would put a smile on his face Great product Great Price and they look great on his feet

I do not by retro Jbecause I was born when they originally came out I do love the Spiz ikes series Had tons of complements on my shoes Thanks Finish Line Thanks France

Dear Nike

Very comfortable shoe to play in Lightweight shoe with very good grip indoors and outdoors so you will not slip and you can make fast cuts and movements without having to worry about slipping

Good traction is the only reason i gave the shoe 2 stars The lunarlon feels basically like phylon And i feel they could have made the shoe more breathable Im so happy i didnt pay full price for this under whelming shoe made from Nike for Kobe

I got these at my local factory store at a good price I would wear them casually but not as a basketball shoe to play in I agree with other that the tongue is too thin and their is limited breathability on these

This shoe is comfortable and tight feels like a low top I only wear lows but the Kobe A would is a great acceptance

If you love Kobe shoes you will love this that zoom air unit in the heel is amazing and the shoe is so comfortable i would say about a week for break in period but its a amazing shoe and the tech in it is always good kobe did great with this shoe love the look It definitely looks premium and nice and you can book it down the court in this bad boy people need to break the shoe in before reviewing it thats where the bread and butter comes its amazing tho love my kobes

Worst Nike bball shoes I have used ever Crazy hot no ventilation caused blisters and calluses Traction was just ok The tongue is too thin and not comfortable Soles are thick and too rigid can not wear these anymore

The cushioning is good but the tongue is very thin with a heavy outsole that does not feel very flexible

Runs narrow Not worth the retail price returning

I ordered this shoes and I was so excited to receive it But once I did I saw signs of wear As a collector this is really disappointed me

I love these shoes and they finally feel like the Kobeof old last yearKobe ADfelt like a huge step back The only flaws of the shoe is that there is no ventilation which causes your feet to get extremely hot and can even lead to blisters And the only other issue I have experienced is that the tongue needed to have more cushion because the laces dig in to your foot right under where the tongue logo is Otherwise traction is awesome fit is perfect and cushion is the perfect balance of court feel and impact protection

I have had a great history with Kobe shoes and have been trying to find a replacement for my beloved Kobe IX Elite for some time now I have been waiting for the white gum version of these but pulled the trigger since there is no real ETA on that color way I felt like the shoe did not really move with my foot well and that it felt wide but not terribly stable As mentioned the traction was very good better than my KDX but the KDX feel much more connected to the court and better fitted I think the ankle protection on these is much better than the KDX but still not really confidence inspiring Overall I think I will return them and wait for something higher and maybe a Flyknit which moves better

If any of you tend to get a lot of sweat in your crotch region these do NOTHING to keep you dry I got them in the bright blue color thinking I would be fine and ended up looking like I peed myself Try harder Nike

OMG This shoe is LIT I purchased on June 21 2017 via Nike com They arrived yesterday June 26 2017 They look even better in person I have read peoplereviews about being uncomfortable playing basketball crease when running etc If you are wearing these while playing sports you are a fool

Used these tights for kickboxing class and it performed well Will definitely buy these tights again in black

Tried these on in the store immediately fell in love I have larger hips and butt and a smaller waist and often struggle with finding leggings that fit my waist but do not stretch out throughout the day I put them on later that day for MMA where they offered incredible tummy butt support and I did not have to are adjust them every five seconds The fitFlawless Unfortunately after my second time wearing them I began to notice insane pilling between the thighs I tried to ignore it at first but when I was warming up one day it was so unbearably obvious It was a big white linty patch covering my crotch and it looked AWFUL I stopped wearing them as activewear and wore them as casual pants which helped reduce the pilling rate Nonetheless after a few months of owning them I had a friend point out that I had an enormous hole in the butt of them and there was a huge tear on the hips I no longer wear them in public but they are by far the most comfortable nike leggings I own Shame they fell apart so quickly Still intend to buy another pair

i love these leggings they are super comfortable and the fit is just amazing you can wear them to the gym yoga or just lounge in them in my opinion they run thru to size and are not see through

So I kind of had to have these I was definitely worried about these being see through per the other reviews I did my squat test with my brightest underroos on and these passed Totally stoked and feelin fancy during my kickboxing workouts Thanks Nike

true to fit very durable just wish they offered more colorssize 9

I own 2 pairs of these the olive green and the black canvas version Both are supremely comfortable and I love them However on the olive version the laces are different than the black canvas which comes with waxed laces The olive ones you HAVE to double knot them because no matter what way you tie them otherwise they will come untied within 5 minutes of walking around That is my only complaint but comfort and style wise these are on point and fit TTS

The legendary tights are my favorite style I was excited to see they are opening up to more colors to expand my collection

I am 5 feet 25 5 waist 35 5 hips I bought these in an extra small They are very comfortable and you can not see through them You can wear them for exercise lounging around home or errands I love them and I will buy more pairs

Love these shoes especially with the poison green accents Also love that they combined certain aspects from different Air Jordans onto this shoe The shoes are a little stiff on first wear but I am pretty sure they will be fine once they break in

Great shoes for casual wear or training your butt off

This Jordan spizike is very eye catching and stylish I am glad I chose this show because it is comfortable cool and versatile with multiple outfits The materials used to make it are good quality and durable

I am a huge fan of the SpizikesI previously bought the Wolf Grey Spizikes so I had to get this one with the crazy colorway They look real great My only complaint is that I purchased these using the size of my other pair as a reference which is a size 12 It fit me very tightly I felt some discomfort after an hour or two of walkingit felt small I might return them or exchange for a larger size

The shoe is amazing I am a frequent puchaser of Jordan shoes and I really like this shoe I would most certainly recommend this shoe and purchase from Nike com do not hesitate because they may run out

The look and style of this shoe are great Because I am flat footed I have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably But bring able to order a 12 5 was great Though the road to getting my shoes was rocky I truly appreciate nike for working to complete my order

These spiikze are nice for children As for adults I do not think so

My wife and my 15 year old and 13 year old kids have Jordans and they love them They told me that I needed to step up my shoe gameI did just that with these Spizikes and I do not know why I did not get them earlier I love these shoesstylish comfortable great fit If you are thinking about getting yourself in the shoe game I highly recommend these Spizikes Nike nailed it with these shoes

Fit as expected great shoes got lots of compliments from them

I wear size 16 am and the fit was perfect I like the color combinations but the top of this particular model is to busy looking for my taste I returned this pair begrudgingly because of the busy look If you do not mined the look I recommend you give them a try

Great style Great fit Dress down or dress up Awesome

Is very comfortable and I like the style I recommend this Jordan

Awesome JordanLove them one of my faves 1

I love the style and fit of this shoe It is very durable and comfortable

I had to get these A must have for a shoe collector

Great shoe Comfortable light weight and true to size

I own a lot of spizikes and they never let me down

i want them all

Goes very well with jeans and shorts I will be buying this shoe more in the future

They are comfortable and colorful and I like the Jordan spizikes

I bought this shoe to wear both on and off the court They have been great in both places Off the court people always tell me they love them and where did I get themOn the court they have great support for the ankles and are very cool looking The worst part about these shoes is the traction I think that these shoes were designed more for casual wear than for playing in Overall this shoe is the best I own

The shoe brings 4 great shoes into 1 I own 5 pairs and counting Comfortable and clean retro look made my own with Nike ID silver and black for my fav football team Get some son

great kicks i love jordans there nun like it gd for any occasion

I bought Jordan Spiz ike in March with another pair of Hyperdunk I only wear these for basketball twice a week from August until October I play ball on an outdoor hard court These shoes were uncomfortable on the first two tries It did not get much better after that The top side is hard When I bend my toes the top leather maybe not leather creases and pushes into my small toe In about 3 months the creases I mentioned started to crack on both shoes Left insole broke

Amazing shoe very comftrable and great ankle support Definately one of my favorite pair of shoes i would highly recoomend it

I do not know why the are popular

very comfortable nice shoe this shoe is great ni

I like the style and color scheme of this shoe a lot and have worn them frequently My only complaint is the yellow arch straps at the ankle get dirty immediately I really take care of my shoes so I do not get it But I would not be discouraged from buying it for this reason They are worth it

I love everything about these and I am happy that I purchased them I HAVE ALREADY BEGAN MY COLLECTION

it is a great shoe but I only have 1 complaintThe yellow part of the shoe is just paper and it came off so easily

Got them and loved them so much I eventually plan on getting another pair Would definitely recommend to a friend

Bestttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

Honestly would not have touched spizikewith a 10 foot pole until this color way came out Nice pop and the shoe is actually comfortable Impressed on the above average build quality and detail on the actually shoe

Great shoe jordan brand did it again the quality is amazing this shoe is a head turner

these shoes are too dope goes with everything interchangeable laces come with them

this is one of the best looking shoes you can buy goes well with anything and its a classic although it isnt super comfortable doesnt really concern me though becasue if i wanted a comfort shoe i would have gone with a 360 full air

I waited too long to buy these shoes and when they went on sale they sold out of my size in every mall in my area I paid DOUBLE the sale price of these shoes and bought them online because I wanted them so much DEFINITELY worth the troubleampmoney I LOVE THEM

I have been collecting and rocking Air Jordans and other Jordan releases since 89 and these Spizikes are in my top 5 they look so good I did not even want to put them on The pictures and youtube videos reviewing them do not do them justice The shoe is HEAT If your undecided about this shoe cop it before it is hard to find The style and the comfort of the shoe is top shelf one of the most comfortable of any sneaker I own Nike Jordan did extremely good on this shoe

This shoe is great for basketball The traction is great and it is very comfortable for my feet

and feel great on your feet The black is so good lookin

I probably have all of the Spizikes but these are my FAVORITESssssssss Hands Down it is like walking with a piece of Art work on your FeetGet you a pair while they LASTTT

usaully do not walk much in my jordans but i walked about a mile or so and red part of sole on one of the sneakers wore down to the grey luckly it is on bottom of sneaker should last a little more then a mile but they are hot sneakers jordan quality isnt like it used to be

Great shoe pretty comfortable plus it doesnt crease The infrared suede and pull tab are fly Goes great with jeans and shorts

These Are Fresh There Pricey But Worth It When I Took These To School Everyone Loved Them You Get Every Pennys Worth Recommend comfy and stylish plus great colorway dang great 

Got a lot of compliments on these The colorway specifically the touch of varsity purple is great

The 1st pr of JordanI ever bought Got them a sze too small cuz i wanted them that much at the time Have been the perfect wkend bar hop shoe and flashy enough to get by strict night club rules

The shoe is not for all sneaker heads but it holds a special place in any Jordan collectors arsenal I like the look of the shoe especially the red colorway and the materials and craftsmanship is very nice alot better than its predecessors especially the tongue and lace overlay Now the bad the shoe is 7 out of 10 for comfort due to the heel area near the achilles tendon It is extremely rigid and has very little give Maybe it may soften but after an hour of wear you still feel it pressing on heel Better shoe but not a great shoe

Fortunately Nike reimbursed me

These shoes are tight and got many compliments Even though its pricey it is worth it Comfortable and flashythe perfect combo

Fits very comfortable last two pair of spikes have felt great

I was not too impressed with these at first but after I put them on and saw them on my feet I was very impressed These are super hot and the design flows well together They combine pieces of some of my favorite shoes into one and this color way is not to loud so its just my style

the shoe is good feels good but i wish that this shoe did nt show any of the glue because we paying so much money for them and the quality is garbage and every jordan that come out you can see the glue

Got these yesterday after being mad over the fact that I could not get the motorsport 6s and They didnt dissapoint They got like the best new shoe smell and I havent worn them cuz they are just so nice to look at and smell and I got the cool grey spizikes when they came out and after wearing them so much they are pretty beat up and I do not wanna do that to these but they are really Nice but i cant say how they feel cuz i havent tried them on

The jordan spizike is one of the sickest jive ever owned they are the comfiest jordans i own plus they are my favorite props to mars blackman this is one of the most known jordans ever this is a great shoe

Patronizingly Haughty and a very perfect shoe to wear it feels great and snug on my feet the same feeling everytime and i love it and i will continue to buy them until my last day

okay so these i had to think about the pictures did not look good on websites but when you have them on your feet they are absolute HEAT

This was always the one Jordan shoe that I thought was the sharpest the one that I truely wanted Now I have it I call it the one because it captured want MJ was on the court Both stylish and elegant on the court But a solid performer as well I think it was his greatest shoe of all the shoes he ever designed Wear yourwith pride

do not go by the pics These are hot When you see them you will know GET THEM NOW

Shoes came in less than perfect conditrion Was not imnpressed with the order overall Would still do busihness with nike again though

this is a nice shoes i love the design and the colors

these shoes are so sick i trying to get the whole entire colletion of them

both of these jays are dope i could not decide which pair to get so i bought both i am a very big fan of spizi ikes i have most of the colorways thay have produced including the exclusive fire red spiz ikes the shoe is very comfortable great fit just another two pairs to my collection other then that this is very comfortable shoe and you should buy it

 fake

YO I copped the Cool Greyafter copping the online release White and Varsity Reds and wow am I Thrilled This sneaker represents a collective selection of Jordans that during their time were unmatched and still remain unmatched today when it comes down to exclusivity making these Bad Boys as exclusive as any other numbered Jordan I would definetely cop a pair and put away a pair Peace

Do The Right Thing and get these These Spiz ike shoes are hot Fit good look good smell good Feel like getting my momma a pair

I have been waiting for anything in the cool grey colorway for a while now The best looking Spizikes by far Still very comfortable

This is by far one of the best colorways for the Spiz ike in my opinion They look better in person than on any computer monitor The customer service at Nike is unmatched

it is comfortable kinda runs narrow but other than that they are great your feet will adjust

Excellent great fit and they look are very cool I Hope that in a near future they make other fusions for example III XVIII and XX

These shoes are real headturners whenever I go to school with these or anywhere Just because these are all sold out in whichever mall I go to just because of the colorway and the great design I am really happy that I copped these so they can be in my various collection of Jordans

I have been searching for this shoes for like 3 years and finally I got them Love them

This the best released colorway since Nike Air Jordan introduced the Spiz Ike The quality build on these jordans are impressive and look better in person These were long awaited and should belong in any jordan collection

Very nice love the shoe jordan needs to release more spizike need more color ways very very good shoe

These shoes are a really nice buy They are expensive but if you are a shoe guy they are a must have The color is great and might be the best that this model has These shoes are not the most comfortable I have The shoes are rather narrow and give me pain once in a while The shoes are great because of the great Jordan shoes that it combines The shoe is hot and people will turn their heads to see these on you It comes down to if you are willing to pay the expensive price for these guys

comfortable and stylish as great as i had hoped for

Was not a fan of the Spiz ike line until this colorway I had been planning to purchase a pair online because of the Europe only release until I learned of the pending US release Fantastic Shoe

I do not USE THESE TO PLAY BASKETBALL IN BUT MORE FOR FASION I JUST WANNA THANK NIKE FOR RELEASING THESE IN THE USA I THINK THERE ONE OF THE BEST SPIZIKES TO DATE

I do not wear these shoes too much but i love everything about them From the colorway to the laces Great lookin shoe Goes with everything

Great Shoe Great Color and Cheap This Jordan Spikes are better than the other Spizikes and more popular

The shoes fit perfect I can walk wearing these kicks all day long And the color way is unique yet easy to look at

These Jordans Spiz ike are very cool i use them for basketball and i like them I use to use Nike Hyperdunks but i prufure these Jordans

very good shoe comfortable and looks good too great shoe

it is really comfortable not to mention it has great designs and the color just tops it off

i bought these late this december they are really confortable and they can last you alot because they are black this shoes is one of my favorites because they look great i also like them because they did more than 1 fussion in these shoes

I got the 11 12 cdp but these were my second option they are very nice

First of all these are my absolute favorite Jordans ever This is because i think they are the most comfertable and look the best But other than that the swagger in these shoes is crazy so for every Jordan feind owning at least 1 pair of spiz ikeis a must

i woke up early to get these after missing out on the 11 12 cdp i had 2 get some jand im glad i got these and the cool grey 1 

very happy wit the product besides a little scratch on the suede grey part

The red Spizikeare everything I thought they would be and more I am an avid collector and I have seen this shoes for up to triple the price I am glad you guys brought them back Keep the Jordancoming

its a very nice shoe fits well Im a big fan of the jordan brand I mainly collect and the shoes fit nicely not too tight not too loose just right Im very satisfiedthanks

These shoes are unbeliavably beautiful These shoes does not have the traction needed to play basketball so i just use them for casual wear They are a real headturner

These shoes came out excellent i love the way it looks

comfort elegance and style mold into one Great shoes

my favorite colorway for the spizike by far i was not lucky enough to get these when they first came out but heard this site got them so i had to cop right away i did get the true blue spizike and it is probably the most comfortable shoe i have then when i realized the comfort came from the jordan 20 shoe i searched for a pair and came across the quickstrike 20im looking forward to good deals and the trend setting items that nike jordan is able to provide

As much as people hate on Spiz ikes this is by far one of the better colorways

Foams are my favorite shoe of all time Had to have this one

Love them I find an excuse to wear them everyday they are so comfy

They fit true to size even if you have wide or narrow feet A little tight awkward at first but the more you wear them the more they mold to your foot I love the look and the zoom cushioning is perfect

The color is fantastic and it feels good to wear My son has fat feet and he can not wear them

Another pair of foams and this color way looks dope with jean joggers and a white Tee

Awesome fit and easy to clean and very comfortable great product Nike

These shoes are very comfortablein have a nice fit around your ankle These shoes are very easy to clean And do not have any problemsshoe does not scuff easily is very easy to clean and is very durable overall a great shoe

When Nike came out with foamposite I was all over them The Material of the shoe makes the feel of a normal shoe completely different in a good way Comfort For me I love the looks of a shoe and the features of it but the number 1 thing for me is the comfort and Nikefoamposite definitely has that I have a few pairs of foamposites myself I frequently wear my foamposite Weatherman It is a great very comfortable Everyday exotic looking shoe to wear And I love when shoes are exotic and foamposite is a very exotic shoe everything about the shoe is great and I love wearing them and they are definitely the most comfortable shoes in my shoe collection A lot of people would put Jordan or Lebron or KD or Kobe or Griffey over foamposites but I would put foamposites over all of that Foamposites are definitely THE most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn however they are not good for basketball because of the weight or the non flexable material and they are a bit pricy but usually that is not a problem overall Nikefoamposite is a great shoe and I absolutely love wearing them

Really good shoe cool colors LOVE THE SHOE NIKE ITS WORTH THE MONEY

Purchasing this shoe was definitely the best decision I made when it comes to buying sneakers it is my first pair since all I ever bought were JordanAnd in my opinion Foams are way more comfy than any JI have put on Keep up the the high quality foams and dope colorways nike

for those who have never had a pair if you are wearing them for casual wear they will last a long time and very easy to clean they will feel a little tight id say they are accurately true to size they will losen and break in the more you wear them and feel alot better for basket ball they are extremely durable not much room for an ankle brace unless you go up a size

This my first pair of foams and I love them They are true to size and fit perfect I wear them all the time and for long periods of time and at the end of the day my feet do not hurt like some other pairs of shoes

Thx

These stealth foams are super comfortable because the foamposite material molds to the shape of your feet the more you wear them because of the warmth from your feet They fit TRUE TO SIZE TRUE FITTING do not get a larger size because then the the shoe will look big on your feet and when you being to break them in they get a little looser Deal with the tight fit for a couple of wears and then it forms a perfect fit on your feet

I have been a sneakerhead for over 20 years and these are the first Foamposites I have ever owned Never really thought about them in the 90s because I mostly wore Jordans however this colorway won me over They style is an instant classic At first the fit felt tight and snug but after a few hours the foams start to form to your feet Highly recommend these for balling or just casual wearing

great shoe purchase

These sneakers are great and the make the shoes a everyday wear I suggest you go up an half a size they run a little small unless you do not mind breaking them in Me personally like the shoes to be a little loose so you do not have to break them in

Foamposite are extremely durable and will last you a almost a life time if you take care of them and it is a nice color way

I just got my pair of platinum and crimson foamposites the other day They were my first pair and already I cannot wait to get another They look so slick and are flexible which is surprising because the shoe is rather heavy Give them a few days to break in and they will be fine for playing basketball The material quality on the shoe seems excellent as well The lip of the hard black material is showing in the middle of the shoe toward the bottom is coming up slightly but other than that the shoe seems flawless in every other aspect So whether your wearing these shoes for style or for sports I recommend them They are worth every penny

finally this foam posite was my first time as born time

This shoe is great to play Basketball in it basically wraps to your foot The Shoe is also good for casual wear and show I have 3 pairs metallic red pine green and these and I like the metallic reds the best

Best Sneaker On The Market Hands Down Cant wait until March 17th for The Golden State Foams to Drop

Shoe is Excellently made Super comfortable Colorway is super attractive

I have this sneaker in every color Nike has released it and I think it may very well be one of Nikes all time best sneaker designs Hope I can get my hands on the galaxy foamposites

Great shoe It seems skinda heavy in your hand till you put them on and realize it feels like walking on air After your feet warm up the shoes the foamposite mold adjust to the curves on your feet to not only provide support but to also give you more control over the empty nooks in your shoe One of the best shoes of all time Def a must have

Fav shoes evr got Super comfy and hugs my feet A little tight though

all i gotta say is these sneakers are too ill very comfortable and are my favorite kicks

this was a great buy i am really enjoying the product

Shoe is true to size and fits snug Played in these and they are really comfortable Only downfall is there is no ankle support A great shoe to even sport in shorts just like Jordans

I just bought 2 of these 1 to rock 1 to stock that makes 44 pairs of foamposite 1s and pros in my collection Even though the quality has dropped since the 2009 Eggplants I still love the foams

ONLY ONE THING TO SAY SENSATIONAL BOUGHT THEM EARLY FRIDAY MORNING WORE THEM THE SAME DAY LOVE THAT FEELING WHEN YOU ROCK NEW KICKS THAT EVERYONE NOTICES WILL CONTINUE TO LOVE THE DESIGN AND COLORS WILL NEED A NEW CLOSET FOR MY COLLECTION THANK YOU NIKE FOR CHANGING THESE SNEAKERS AROUND FOR US TO ENJOY I WEAR SIZE 13 NOT 9 AND THE WEEK BEFORE A BOUGHT THE ELECTRIC GREEN NIKE IM GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE A WAY TO WRITE THESE OFF ON MY TAXES THE WAY I KEEP BUYING THEM LOL

It looks even better in person Nike keep them coming

By far the foams are the best shoe nike has every made Purchased the royal to go with my coppers cough drops and pearls Pewters drop on 3 16 11 big Jiles Mooks and Woods

Goota get all the colorways these shoes really mold to yourf foot they are definitely a staple for any sneakerhead

Absolutely one of Nikegreatest creations Been wearing foams since their debut in 97 at 14 years old and will continue to love wear the foamposite one until I am layed to rest This shoe was truly ahead of it is time Much love for Nike on this shoe Worth every Penny Big ups to Penny Hardaway as well man the foamposite is nuts This shoe is so ill

The title says it all One of the greatest sneakers God ever made

the first time you wear this you are gonna think that the posite material is uncomfortable because it is so hard and narrow inside but once you start playing on it your feet releases heat which will soften the posite material and eventually will form to your feet to give you that maximum comfortability that your feet demands that is what makes this shoe so special

DOPE shoe

Great overall shoe The foamposite material form to your foot so overtime it feels like you only wearing socks Zoom Air in the heel provide great cushioning specially after landing or jumping on the court Overall classic and great shoe

I just got this color way today 12 23 10 and already own the eggplant and copper color ways of these shoes They are SUPER comfortable as well as SUPER comfortable These shoes last forever PSi would go a half size up they seem to run a bit small because of the sock lining

I am on hunt now for the next one coming

not as good as the ones from last year the grooves are shallower and less defined returned them and got a pair of 09 

LOVE THEM

I love the color and material on these they really have that penny feel to them It was worth me waiting up late to get these look out in a couple of years when these are hard to come by

This is what true basketball sneakers are made of I will not want want to ever regret the but because of the realest of all sneakers is right before your eyes Carbon Fiber patent just intensifies to a magnitude to make the shoes look real rude Quality over Quantity ANYTIME I will always be an addict for sneakers and especially for eggplant ones peace

This shoe is very durable The only problem is that the sole is to thin and wears fairly quickly The sole is thinner than the original Varsity Blue Foamposite One This product runs small so recommend getting a half size bigger Overall a very comfortable and secure shoe

These are great shoes to ball in and to just wear around I do not know why people are saying to get a size down or up because these fit TRUE TO SIZE Out of the box they are laced a little tight but when you unlace them and relace them to fit your foot its perfect whether you have narrow feet wide feet like me or somewhere in between The copper color pops when you see them in person and the icy soles just give these an even better reason to purchase do not let these get by you or you will regret it

The shoe is increidble i actually bought a size 10 5 even though it says 15 when i wear a size 12 I tried the shoe on and it actually fits It is very snug but its a 1 5 size difference I would recommend buying a size down The quality is amazing i love the shoe Buy it

Always check here first before you decide to wait in line for hours in the snow After I got the 1 2 cents I definetly had to add this shoe to the arsenal Pennys are some of the most comfortable shoes

This is the best shoes since the royal blue 1 2 cents

I do not know how i was able to get these online but I did they are sick shoes the foamposite is a little stiff but they are so comfortable and clean looking

Very comfortable and fashionable shoe A highly recomended shoe for any athlete or sneaker collector

The penny foamposites is a classic and a must have amongst sneakerheads shout out to NDC for making products available online

havent worn them yet but they are impossible to get and i got my pair quick shipping and good contact

I usually where a 12 but with all the reasearch i did ahead of time I went a 1 2 size bigger because of the inner sock What can I say the shoe is a classic I am glad I have them hopefully they will come out in more colors like the pearl

The Classic shoe The Classic Fit The Classic look Not a cheap retro and true to the orginal in quality and turn the head potential A must have

At last

hard to top the royal ogs but this comes pretty darn close

these Foams are sick you will be happy when you get them i love mine one of the best colors

One of the best shoes of 09 they should release one of these shoes in every color

Hope you all didnt sleep on these joints They are mad compfortable but run a half a size small so make sure you guys order half a size up from your normal size Cant wait to see nike drop a Pearl Foamposite

in my opinion i think these are the most classic but sleet basketball sneaker to hit since the great mj

Very dope shoe These shoes are so much nicer in person Sole is supper icy Great material Love these a lot more than the Varsity Blue Foams When you try these on they are so comfortable Great Overall shoe

Sleep if you want but theses are a must have Styish and a instant Classic For all shoe collectors

Quite possibly the best Nike release in a very long time Superior quality form and function make this a must have item for on and off the court

Very comfortable Easy slide and super light Feels good while walking and moving around

Comfortable Only style sliders I wear and will continue to buy

At first I thought I may have needed a bigger size But after a few wearings of getting my feet to very front of sandal the padding broke in underneath the top and now they are just perfect Slide on easy but also stay on well is nice Colors look sharp toolots of where did you get those questions

Bought two pairs this summer for the teens to wear to pool and beach They were comfy and perfect Kids loved them No problems at the beach and pool True to sizeand fit

A little snug at first but they loosen up a little over time Great value for the price very colorful

Great price and cool style THEY RUN SMALL I went up a whole size Very comfortable I highly recommend them

Great slide sandal They are comfortable and stylish

Comfortable and priced right Purchased the red color for my nephew Very stylish too

I advise to buy 1 5 to 2 sizes bigger as they are actually smaller then true size and narrow Other than that this is an excellent product

Great support great style Really like how comfortable they are

I got these for nearly free I wear a size 13 and the straps are not adjustable so the fit just right If you have fat feet this may not work for you the comfort is fine

I Like to think of myself as a Nike ambassador Meaning i only love to wear Nike This is going into my collection amazing footwear and i love to wear it around

great value on sale like the snug fit and support

Great price

great pair of sandals sliders looks great and comfort is on point can not really go wrong with a any pair of sandals

These Nikes are pretty cool They actually feel great and have some cushion for long days of wearing Best Part is the Camo look Bought them for a 17 year old and then his dad asked for a pair too

a bit small get 1 2 sizes up then normal they are comfy but a bit snug but that is okay

At first these slides were great They fit nice they were comfortable and they were just starting to really mold to my feet Then this happened The part where your foot bends just suddenly tore on one slide I checked the other just to see and the same exact thing happened Really I have had these less than 6 months and I have barely even used them I used them partially in the summer and just this past week for a trip Annoyed Figured Nike would have better quality materials than this One star for you

Might need to size up at least one full size

boguht 2 pairs one for myself and one for my wife my wifesize is her sneaker size and fit perfectly I also bought my regular sneaker size 14 i could not even get these things on my feet i have never had a problem with the fitment of any nike sandals before but these are just ridiculous the arch of my foot is not even high at all but i could only get my foot half way into these

They are very stylish or eye catching but not comfortable in my opinion The sizing in this model runs small so you might want to go up a size for fitting correctly

Great fit very comfortable good arch support thickness

I love the look and the Just Do IT print on this slide and I really really want to love them but they just do not fit right And after trying Kawa slides and not loving them either well it is not you Nike it is me While Nike sneakers fit me better than most brands the slides do not The fit of the Benassi slide is right at size 14 but there is just something funny about how my foot fits on the footbed it feels like my heels are falling off to the inside as I walk it is almost like they need a bit more of a curve to the slide itself or maybe my foot is just curved more than most people

These are my 9 month old puppy favorite chew toy He chews on them all day long and they STILL have not lost their shape You can barely tell the damage im super impressed all my other sandals are destroyed 10 10 would recommend

Buy them a size up especially if you plan on wearing them with your game day socks They feel a little tight with even thin socks

The slides are very great in terms of comfortably and style too You can just slide them on when going out shopping or doing other kinds of chores as also wearing them to school when you do not feel like dressing up

Good product for the price Very basic slide Pretty comfortable just a little big but very durable and washable

When I do not feel like wearing my shoes I put on my Nike slides they are very comfortable and affordable

She says they are comfortable and really cool she can not wait to get more allowance and get another pair

These are those comfortable sliders ever these are my 3rd pair in 3 different colors

These slides fit a bit smaller first few times to wear they are getting more comfortable as I kept wearing them Very comfortable Nice to wear after working out

These are the best sandals for anyone They are comfortable and everyone should have a pair of them

They are definitely comfortable and a great pair of sandals considering the price but run a little narrow Wish they came in half sizes

These slides fit somewhat true to size however the actual part keeping in your foot is somewhat tight and can get quite hot at times otherwise i great product just wish there were half sizes to size up

I wore these maybe 30 days maybe 40 days total before the sandals broke My last pair of sandals from a different manufacturer lasted me 8 years of normal use Needless to say I will not use these sandals again

These are a good and comfortable pair of slippers but they run a little narrow

Look no further buy this product It was exactly what I was looking for and for a great price

This product was complete what I expected from the site It was durable correct sized and was all mine Thank you so much for your services

Ive sent it back via UPS It was too small I ordered a size 10 and sent it back requesting a size 11 Other than that no complaints

Very comfortable and easy to slide on when you need to go quickly

Got them in three colors for my best friend and he can not stop raving about them

this is the 3rd time ive bought these since I was a kid they are just the right sandal for me comfortable last a long time and so easy to care for thanks

More comfortable than the other brands for sure Nike did good with these sandals

Sandal is comfortable but runs small Sandal needs to be stretch At first very tight fitting I had bought a bigger size and still should have bought one more size up

This is an amazing product and fits great I definitely will buy this again

It look way better in person Great Slippers Everyone should own a pair of Nike slippers

First off I have to give it to Nike for the A 1 shipping of their products They do not hesitate or hold your order The second they can get you item out the door to you they do Thumbs up for that As far as the product Its great Durable great price and long lasting materials Thanks Nike

My boyfriend loves these flip flops and he wears them all the time He wears them in the house too as slippers

it is very stylish and comfortable Great for lounging

The product runs much too tight and narrow in my experience I am about 5ft7 and am of thin build so its not that my foot is abnormally fat or anything of the sort The only way these have been able to fit comfortably are with very thin socks which I do not plan on wearing with these comfortable socks tend to run on the thick side I am exchanging these for a size up and would advise future buyers to go ahead and order a full size up All that considered they are very comfortable and provide very good arch support

I love the shoes that I bought my boyfriend they are very comfortable and very durable he tells me he loves them a lot and would like another pair

This product was a gift for my husband He loved it and wears then all the time

Excellent value very comfortable would definitely buy again

This slip on is perfect for everyone I recently bought every person in my family a pair for xmas and they cant get over the comfort fit and ease that they have come to expect from Nike Perfect 10

I got the male size because the womens was sold out runs a little small but fit really snug This shoe is comfortable for just relaxing around the house or running errands

These are great shoes that cradle the feet for comfort Love relaxing and wearing these

I use my slides everyday and everywhere I even have them on right now Nike slides are the best and I wouldnt use any other brand

These sandal are very Comfortable practical and stylish too

I really like this product I have bought them for my sister boyfriend and myself and we all love them Super comfortable and would definitely recommend

Good price and good look Recommend people to buy it when you wear it at home or walk

Very comfortable slides Although seem to run small

The best made Sandels for the price it is well worth the purchase even late in the season I purchased a pair in August

Great shoes great price and great comfort and as a special bonus the shoes arrive before expected

Best slides ever and the color is bananas I even bought pairs for my kids

Great for the beach lounging or after a game perfect fit

Bought these for my son to wear to and from the gym for basketball He does not have a thick foot and very tight for him to slip his foot all the way in Heel of his foot almost hanging off the back Already wore them outside so can not return

These slides arrived just on time They look nice and are comfortable The length was great but the band was a little tight at first We just assumed maybe you need to work them in so we kept them

Great for after a workout or just to be comfortable

This shoe is really great My son loves the slider type shoes They are easy to slip on and can be worn around the house or stepping out to the store Im thankful for previous reviews because I had to purchase the shoes a whole size bigger for comfort and they kind of run small Overall I have not gotten any complaints

Very comfy Got the mens ones and sized down because they were a better price

This slipper is what I have been looking for it is comforting and has has great support Ideal for moderate exercise and relaxation

They were smaller then expected but I still like them

Size appears appropriate with ultimate comfort after break in it will feel a little tight across the front at first My kids want to wear mines to school so they be in the cool crowd Wow my kids think I am hip again

These slides are the real deal HolyField lol Very clean and simple but gets the job done Very durable and comfortable feel Taking it back to the basics not complex just a good overall product No major complaints

My son has wanted some for sometime Finally I got him a pair and he hardly takes them off He said they feel so good to his feet and he loves them Several of his friends have now bought some too

DOWNSIDEThese do not dry quick So if you get them wet the inside will not try quick unless you want to wait overnight so they do not really make a good shower sandal

Comfortable and easy to put on they do not fall off and good in water

Width and length fit me just fine but the strap is too tight and is not adjustable I use these only for showering at the gym and for that purpose they are fine Overall I am satisfied I paid a low price with them being on sale

They are very comfortable I really like them and you can wear them after a shower or after a sport They are very nice I recommend them to anybody

i like this shoe it is VERY comfy it also looks very good i personally do not swim i use this before and after basketball and football

These are great slides I got th blue ones ive been complemented on how they look and they are real comfortable

great slide comfortable and great price My son wears them after football practice and loves them

I love the nike sandals the only thing is that you should order a size up or two Thats the only thing

takes a while to dry i recommend to only by one size up i bought mine two sizes up and its kinda loose when i wear them great buy though Nice slippers for a good price

good slippers Fun to use Very comfortable I am probably going to buy my brother a pair You can just walk around in them or use them for any after sport activity

These were for my 14 year old son Acually he wears a size 14 not 8 as listed above He loves them He wears them to school and also toand from school basketball games and said they are great and just what he was looking for I would recommend them to anyone looking at a pair of sliders for a reasonable price 99 9 of the shoes in my familyhouse are NIKE and we could not be happier with their products

These are great shoes Nice to wear after games etc Very comfortable The only thing is that you do not have the ability to make the shoe tighter so you have no choice as to how lose or tight it is on your foot Otherwise its a perfect fit

These were a gift for son in law he loves them HE BRAGS ON THE WORKMANSHIP HE IS ROUGH ON FOOT WEAR BUT THESE HOLD UP WELL

These shoes are great for when your done playing basketball and you want to relax your feet Or if you just wnt to walk around in the house in them

IF YOU WEAR A SIZE 9 ORDER A SIZE 10 OR 10 AND 1 2 BECAUSE THEY COME IN SMALL SIZES SINCE THEY DID NOT FIT ME I GAVE THEM TO MY MOM IDK WHAT SHE THINKS OF THEM I GUESS SHE WOULD SAY THEY are OK

Handles everything I throw at them perfectly Snatches Cleans Running Double Unders and Rope Climbs No need to ever change into an Olympic lifting shoe comfortable out the box stable every chance I get I am buying another pair

I bought these shoes for gym use only and since they exceed expectations there I now find myself wearing these shoes casually too Great level of comfort while serving as a good enough shoe for heavy lifts such as squatting deadlifts

I have been looking for a good training shoe that is also comfortable to run in and these are it These have a much softer base for your heel to land in and are solid during my workouts have not had any issues of late i know ppl say the back loop comes off mine is still intact so I will just be aware of it now But great show got a lot of compliments of how they look comfortable

I just received these shoes today and they look very good and and fit pretty snugg except the heel My heel moves a little when i walk in them and after walking around my house for a little while my left heel really started to hurt and I looked and there is absolutely no padding in the backs of the heel just hard plastic covered in fabric Even if theses shoes did fit me I cant imagine running and training in them If i go a size down I feel my toe would be squished

These are my first pair of Nikes and I could not be happier To run in these on a treadmill is like running on clouds now Highly recommended

I wear a size 14 for the Nike Free Metcon And I need to tie my shoes tight just like anyone would who is working out The holes that hold the laces already broke and I have had the shoes 1 month 1 broke on my right shoe and 2 have broken on my left shoe About done with Nike Unbelievable

The shoe looks great and fits well but it definitely lacks durability I am a physical therapist so I am on my feet all day lifting and moving patients I ordered on Jan 29 and they arrived early February At nearly 2 months in the soles are wearing out and the back loop for pulling the shoe on has begun tearing off at the back of the shoe Not only is the loop tearing off it is tearing the shoe with it

I feel like the shoes feel too loose like i wish i could tied them up higher and tighter yet there is not way to do so they constant feel loose i am an 8 5 on every nike shoe i have ever purchase yet this feel perfect yet on the heel a bit loose it sucks because i love the sole of the shoe its perfect for woads that require running since the metcon feels too hard i wish the upper was the same as the metcon so i could tie my shoes properly without feeling the heel loose and then it would be perfect

OK Nike you want to make headlines with Steph Curry making good on his promise to a young female that he should make his shoes in girls sizes and not just boys how about you apply that to these shoes and all shoes for that matter Stop passing these off as unisexThey are VERY wide as a menshoe SHOULD BE and my average width female foot was drowning in the width of size 10 5 and 11 Womenthat I ordered The box showed up and was 100 mensizing on the packaging both on the box and on the shoe as Men9amp9 5

Good looking shoehowever it is not for good for agility work or anything that involves cutting The first time I tried to change direction in a shuttle run the flyknit upper stretched so much that I rolled my ankle This is not a shoe for change of direction Returned

Had these shoes for a couple of months and loved them for my gym shoes However a hole has worn through on my right heel and it rubs against my heel so bad I had to stop wearing the shoes altogether For the price of the shoes I would expect more than 3 months of use Would not recommend these to anyway unless changes were made

I have bought every version of the regular Metcons and ended up returning them I really wanted to like them because they were just way too stiff heavy and did not feel right when squatting and performing other lifts in the gym so I kept going back to my old Converse shoes I had always been thinking to myself that if they made something similar to the Free Trainers but more stable they would be perfect So when I saw these I immediately ordered them and they nailed it with these Hope these are here to stay and eventually replace the regular Metcons

I love the look and reasonably light weight of these shoes but like so many styles now they do not have a tongue If you have a high arch it is impossible to get them on especially with socks SO disappointing

Bought these in the black black black I needed some real training shoes as I had been wearing my Nike Free running shoes and while they are good for cardio stuff I felt unstable during certain movements and exercises These feel great with good stability and flexible enough for short runs They look fantastic in my opinion and now I want the grey color For most shoes I wear a 10 but with Nike I always wear a 10 5 and that is what size I got in these and they fit perfect

I have been going to the gym for a while wearing my Nike Frees and during leg days I would always take them off in order to do back squats since it never felt stable These shoes are awesome They are comfortable for most exercises at the gym but the best part is that they feel as if your feet are firmly planted to the ground during heavy lifts I like the look as well as the fit and will definitely buy another pair when these start to wear out

I absolutely love these shoes for lifting they have great support and are very comfortable I have had no problems with them while running only while cutting While nothing has happened I feel like I am going to slip every time i change directions at full speed

The shoe looks great I love how they are designed with the colors top sides and bottom however after using them as my regular workout shoe workout 3 4 times week they have broken down after only 3 months on the inside The exterior still looks great but the interior of the shoe have broken down to the point of not being able to wear them to the gym anymore The interior heel padding has fallen apart and cannot even walk in them without getting blisters I have other Nike Metcon brands that perform great under gym conditions over a long period of time oldest pair being metcon2 which is a few years old now and still can do everything in them However these shoes did not hold up which makes me sad and deserve a 1 star rating because if you can not wear a shoe anymore it is trash even if the exterior looks great 1 star

All in all I would HIGHLY recommend these shoes but we will have to wait and see what their durability is like

I got these shoes and loved how they looked If I am just doing standard lifting there are no issues and they work wonderfully but once I start doing things such as high knees they start to untie and slip off

Easily the best metcon I have tried I am a fan of the free trainers most notable the free train force flyknit the the free trainer versatility and free trainer 5 0 I have tried some metcons but never really like them hard to get your foot in too narrow in some part of the fit and too stiff in the sole this shoe is like a free but stable enough to actually lift in Mid area of the sole is solid Almost alarmingly stiff when you unbox them but after a gym session they have the right amount of flex These have a nice little bit of arch support and could easily be wearable on the treadmill or even as a lifestyle shoe They do not have that on the ground feeling of some of the more dedicated powerlifting training shoes I have used but again these are much more wearable outside of the weight area There is a tiny bit of heal slip in them and the materials are not as breathable as I would like I would also like better colorways I got them in the olive which is OK but I would like a bright red or bright blue They fit true to size for me Overall I am very pleased with them They exceeded my expectations

The darn shoes will not stay tied with a double knot it is very frustrating to be in the middle of an intense workout and have to stop to tie your shoes I have started triple knotting these bad boys Please fix this Nike I would be really happy to receive a pair of laces in the mail

Absolutely love the fit and the feel Good CrossFit shoe for WODs that include running jump rope box jumps and most barbell KB DB of light to moderate load The problem lies in the bottom of the shoe When doing heavy load work that does not keep you in one spot ex Sled Push heavy Farmers Carry etc they do not hold up Both shoes started to lose the little inserts on the bottom and both of them tore slightly in the areas that have built in holes Regular Metcons would be much better for this activities

Versatile and durable I have been wearing these all Fall Weight training in the AM around the house short runs etc

I bought these to replace my current gym shoes and i have had them about two weeks I love these shoes everything about them is perfect for what I need them for they are firm yet comfortable but I am extremely disappointed in the durability the inside of the heel of my right shoe has already worn a hole through the cushion material after only two weeks they have been used maybe a grand total of 20 times over the course of the two weeks I have had them so at first my thought was they must be too small but I have checked multiple times during various movements in the gym and I am never straining the shoe I have room at the toe and my heel does not rub so to say Needless to say I am gutted that they have already broken down as I am in love with these shoes otherwise

I have 4 pairs and i love the look and feel of the shoe When i originally tried them on i was so confused as to why my heel felt so squished after a week of wearing them they broke in perfect That being said the fabric where the back side of my heal touches has torn on all 4 of my purchases it doesnt feel any different but its still a bummer to look at overall my favorite shoe to wear walking around town and at the gym But when it comes to bar lifts snatches squats deadlifts cleans i prefer my metcon 4the flat surface feels much more stable

Purchased these as a trainer and light running shoe If you have a narrow foot these are not the shoes for you They are not the most comfortable Nike feel loose and the back my foot always feels as though it is about to slip out Unfortunately these do not work for me and time to ship back

I bought this shoe prior to the Nike free trainer v8 I do plyometric exercises and this is not a comfortable shoe I only wore this three times Too bad I am past the return policy date

They just do not fit Have fairly average feet went through the entire metcon line but heel lift in every case even down a size Was finally able to lock my heel down in the Free Metcon moving the line of action down and back using the lowest holes on the side stays that was good but gave me the opportunity to then feel the lack of support in the forefoot rolling off in hard cuts could not possibly stand up to a good HIIT workout the lacing just does not go far enough down the instep to lock in the ball of the foot roll line Seriously disappointed in the foot last design really really wanted to love these not sure who feet these were designed for but glad I got into the Upper East Side store to try them all out otherwise it would have been a mail order nightmareRZ

I absolutely love these shoes for the gym The toebox is plenty wide enough for foot splay and the heel cups well I get compliments all the time on them

Really loved these shoes but they just have not held up I have had them for less than 2 months and the tabs are ripping off from pulling them on I use these for crossfit workouts about 3x a week and they are great whenever there is running and lifting in a workout where i want the added stability of a more metcon style without being as heavy as my metcon 3s A huge chunk of the bottom ripped out doing rope climbs an issue i have never had with my traditional metcons and something I would not expect from a shoe like this Any shoe advertised for crosstraining needs to be able to stand up to rope climbs and these do not fit the bill Oh well the heel straps are only a few weeks away from ripping as well

Love the versatility style and just good all around everything shoe however ripped a hole without much effort In fact do not even remember how it happened Only look down in the afternoon and the material in the front toe box area just ripped a sizeable and noticeable hole

I will receive them tomorrow and hopefully it could help me reach half of my weight lost goal

Love the feel of the shoe but the quality is not great The pull tab for putting them on ripped after only wearing them for a little while

I bought these shoes to be my everyday go to shoe They are durable and look good enough to wear casually with jeans and nicer shorts I work out in them whenever I am not running for distance I ran 2 miles in them once and felt they were a little to clunky for longer runs and not really designed for that I have not sprinted in them yet Overall I would definitely recommend for everything other than distance running

I have used these for only about 4 intense training conditioning and training sessions and they have already came apart One of the patterns on the bottom of the shoe came right off and the bottom is also ripping I hope this was just a faulty single shoe or maybe I have the wrong shoe for the training but still this shoe should have lasted longer than a week without pieces falling off Everything else is great but the build quality was not good for my pair

By far and away the most versatile and comfortable training shoe I have used to date Flat and stable enough for moderately heavy barbell lifts but cushionedand flexible enough for moderate cardio

These are my favorite Metcon yet First of all they look the best by far I get compliments all the time while coaching and working out Stability while lifting is on point as well as mobility during runs or shuttle sprints The fit is snug like a sock and there is no heel slip With that said my buddy did 1 WOD with 20 rope climbs in it and the front top of the shoe the meshy rubbery feeling stuff which I think is an attempt to make the shoe durable but flexible started tarring He has the black ones and those worn areas started turning white I love the shoes so much that I own two pairs of them However they will be left at home on days with rope climbs and I will resort to my 2 year old Metcon 2s Nike this is a great start to the perfect Metcon Could you please come out with a second version with a more durable front upper like the metcon 2s to combat rope climbsPlease please

When I first put on the shoes they seemed very tight to the point where I thought I may need to go up a size I do not have a very wide foot size in dress shoes but this shoe was tight the entire length of the shoe After the first WOD though they did feel like they stretched out a bit so I think I did order the correct size

We just bought these in May and both of the tabs on the back of the shoes are ripping off Not satisfied with the quality at all with the amount of money that you pay

Really great shoe for working out but already falling apart after a month or so NOT DURABLE

These Metcons are absolute perfection They have the stability and grip for weightlifting and the cushion for short runs I use them for Crossfit Pump and Combat They feel amazing I have three pairs and somehow I think I need more

Bought these to replace my metcon 2s which I liked but the toe box was a little wide for me I absolutely LOVE these for my lifts and cardio involving jumping I would not personally run in them but that is just my preference I am giving 4 stars only because one of my laces came with loose threads which was disappointing If not for the junk laces totally 5 stars

BUT I went to put them on this morning and the back loop that you use to pull them on SNAPPED RIGHT OFF Now it is just blowing in the wind and they look ridiculous I am so upset because I loved these shoes and was hyping them to everyone but now I can not even wear them

Bought these because I needed something with some stability Were way too wide for my foot I moved the laces to the lowest part possible and they still were too loose Felt comfortable just did not fit right In the process of returning them

I have been looking for a good training shoe that is also comfortable to run in and these are it These have a much softer base for your heel to land in and are solid during my workouts The one issue i encountered is after wearing for a couple weeks of workouts the heel loop ripped off which is disappointing

Comfortable shoes that breathe very easily and are incredibly lightweight Was looking for something more flexible than my original Metcon 1s and could not be happier

These bad boys are amazing Being active duty military I tend to workout PT with my squadron 3 times a week and we do various workouts like HIIT or Running or Hero workouts These shoes have kept up with all my workouts on and off work and then some Completely surpassed my expectations Buying another pair because I love them so much Thanks Nike



I have tried almost every version of the Metcon to date but this shoe is by far the best that I have worn I like the fit of the shoe and the comfort that it provides The shoe feels a bit thinner at the front of the shoe than previous metcons and is also more flexible Sole feels like it might be a bit more giving than previous metcons but I have not really noticed any instability when squatting moderately heavy weight I like that the price is much less than the Flyknits and depending on preference may be better The metcon frees are also a bit wider than the Flyknits I primarily use the shoes for CF and workout 5 days a week So far the shoes have held up well so happy about the durability as well

Never been a metcon fan but boy are these amazing Game changer Had to get a half size smaller Comfortable shoe for al around exercising

Easily the best pair of shoes I have ever purchased As comfortable as the Free line with the stability almost of the Metcon 4 Satisfies the best of all worlds for me I use it for squats at work and basic casual wear The perfect shoe and it looks amazing I have the Deep Jungle pair

I have had the shoes for about a week with only occasional use Overall they are very comfortable and good for working outhowever I am disappointed in the overall quality The back strap to help get these shoes on is already breaking off Hopefully the rest of the shoe will not fall apart

I have owned at least one pair of every Metcon released to date in some case two or three pairs and for me this is by far the most comfortable version yet The toe box is of good width it is feels great in the heel and mid foot and it is just seems to work well for every Crossfit or HIIT exercise I am not lifting enormous amounts of weight in terms of squats or Olympic lifts but heavy enough and I do not feel any lack of stability Looking forward to more colorways can we get something in red

I tried jumping rope in these and I could feel my heel slipping Never had this problem with traditional metcons

I wear metconalmost exclusively to the gym however I was looking for something with a bit more cushion WHen these were introduced I jumped on a pair as theyu seemed to be exactly what I was looking for Much to my surprise they do not necessarily have the same feel as the metcon IV and previous iterations but they are REALLY comfortable on treadmill runs feel like a sock cloud great lateral support for side to side movement and have taken the constant beating I put on them under heavy weights on a daily basis This will be my new go to trainer unless durability becomes a problem in which case I will use them as an everyday shoe as they look good as well

Bring back lagoon pulse in smaller sizes for women but do not get crazy and redesign it for women Literally just restock the smaller sizes

These shoes need to carry some smaller women sizes I would buy them so fast but they do not make my size

The fit and function of these shoes is pretty much spot on They are the perfect combination of flexibility and stability everything you need during a CrossFit workout I have used these for everything from running to Olympic lifting and have never felt the shoes underperform I would not recommend these for anything over 3 5 miles but for shorter runs they are fantastic The outsoles grip and dig in quite well during Olympic lifts and the cushioning is firm so you do not sink into the shoes and lose power

I have had Metcon 1 2 3 4 and the Flyknit 1 and 2 I have loved every pair but these are the best style yet I beg of Nike for more designs colors of these I can not say enough good things about this shoe

This shoe delivered on everything this morning The fit is amazing the comfort is perfect and the overall performance of the show delivered I ran with them and lifted this morning I have been currently using the Metcon 4 but wanted something different When I heard these offered some flexibility I was eager to try them I tend to wear a thinner runners sock with my sneakers personal preference so I like the fact these shoes have the custom lacing option which I changed 1 notch down to give the shoe a snugger fit for my heel This shoe is a homerun so please Nike lets keep this going for years with minor changes please Definitely come out with tons of color options that you are doing with the Metcons

Make no mistake these are NOT the Metcons or even the DSX I have used all 3 for cross fit workouts and definitely prefer the others with the DSX being my go to The Metcon Free has a much boxier feel on your foot With that said this shoe is AWESOME as a hybrid between Free Trainers and standard Metcons Way more comfortable than the others while still feeling stable enough for Oly lifting in workouts There is just the right amount of cushioning a little not much on the bottom and the flexibility of the toe is brilliant

this product gives you all the comfort for working out it is flat for squatting and bendable for running the shoe overall is perfect for working out if your looking for a shoe to workout with this is the one

As a performance coach I value stability flexibility and feedback from footwear I hope Nike continues this Trainer line Highly recommended

My black and Hyperion blue pair arrived today I wore it to an Orangetheory session to see how it performs and it was fantastic Running on the treadmill felt good balance and stability for weight lifting and floor work workouts was solid I wear size 9 and ordered size 9 Thought it was a perfect fit Build quality is superb looks pretty dang good too Highly recommend

More room Compared to other shoes i wear an 11 in the airmax 270s and 11 5 in ultraboost But overall these are great Hopefully they come out with more colors

Only con I say is that the first time playing ball in them they do give blisters happened to myself and a friend who also owns a pair But after that they are great

These are the best feeling basketball shoes I now own I love the traction and lightweight feel And they are stylish

Great grip and strong performance at court Preferred indoor games

Easily catches the attention of the hoopers and grants you magical shooting ability like Steph

Crazy traction even on dusty courts bites the ground real well if too dusty a wipe will do the trick

 Great price point

Curry 6 is a great performer great shoe only downside is it runs too big I normally wear a size 10 in basketball shoes Running shoes I wear a 9 and 1 2 I got these in a size 10 as my normal basketball shoes but they are really big I have to wear an insole on top of the normal insole They feel like a size 11

Have amazing grip for indoor court Best basketball shoes I have own so far First time buying curry and I love them

We read the reviews and took a chance on buying them bc my daughter really wanted them Only wore them on the court 6 7 times and started falling apart in the toe and the bottom Very disappointed UA was great with return we opted for money back and we bought a different brand We usually do not have problems with the curry but I think they are not made as well

I have owned almost all model of Currys Curry 2 is the best one And Curry 6 is the second Performance is great and very comfortable

The title says it all buy with the ultimate confidence

Those are my first UA basketball shoes Grwate looking and very comfortable

My husband and I both got a pair of the Curry 6 shoes for indoor pickleball games We bought the blue and orange color and think they look so stylish We absolutely love the fit and comfort of the shoes I have had surgeries on both feet and love how wide the toe box is and how they fit my wide feet

Got the Fox Theatre pair and love them Wear them casually and they run true to size

Bought these for my 12 year old son He loved them so much he wanted every color He says they are comfortable have good grip and look amazing

I have owned every model of Currys and the Curry 6 is only topped by the Curry 2 in comfort and performance

Bought them for my husband and he absolutely loves them

I brought this product for my son and he absolutely loves them

I bought the pair of curry 6 in red on January 18 this year but today this is the third time I worn them to play the basketball in indoor stadium I do not believe that the problem that people said in the comments happened to me The rubber under the sole on the right shoe seperate I am a big fan of Stephen Curry and I felt really upset because I really think these shoes look good I hope to receive the response from your team and give the solution to me I did not use them for daily walk and just for playing basketball I believe it is not my problem so please help me with that

These shoes are great but unfortunately they do not fit true on your feet

The shoe does a great job holding you down into the shoe however it lacks a bit of security when it comes to holding the foot back into the heel for maximum security

I cannot comment on the performance of this show as I seldom play basketball these days due to my bad feet and flat feet My podiatrist prescribed me basketball shoes to wear to stabilize my feet and I been wearing since 2 years ago I support Curry and been buying underarmour for a while now and find them to make quality shoes These Currys are very comfortable once you break them in after several days I like that they come in low top and the design and color are very nice 2 months so far with no issues

Shoe feels great Performance is great Only draw back for me personally is if I try wearing the shoes for just normal day activity it tends to rub right on my ankle but does not happen when wearing basketball socks Great shoe can not wait for the 7s

I have owned and worn every version of Curryto date This version is the closest yet to the cushioning I desire The Hovr cushioning is a big step forward and I love the lacing system Very comfortable fit that runs true to size Keep the improvements coming Under Armour

This is my first ever pair of Curryand I was really excited about them and my first venture away from Jordan Brand I had my first chance to play in them two days after their delivery As a big Curry and Warriors fan I was really happy and appreciative of the graphic inside the show on the sole heels saying In the Town with the Oak branches Sadly while playing in them I felt something in my shoe while running but they did not bother me enough to stop take them off When I was done with my games I realized that what was rolling around in my shoes was that commemorative graphic that rubbed off and bunched up into balls of whatever material they are made of The graphics were not salvageable I am really really bummed that my shoes no longer have this commemorative dedication to Oakland It would be really great if UA and Steph find a way to weave the graphic into the soles or a better way to print imprint them so that they do not rub off during the first use It means a lot to Dub Nation and especially natives of Oakland to have this effort made

These were actually more comfortable than I expected The ankle support was more rigid than other shoes I am used to wearing but that is to be expected I wear these at my normal work shoes not so much for basketball and I have had no issues on my commute or during the normal work day Would buy again

After trying on all the other name brands my son came back to the Under Armour Curry basketball shoe The Curry 6 is by far his most favourite UA basketball shoe since the Curry 2 No other shoe compared to comfort and performance well UA

Great shoe I have had 4 pairs of them Which is great but also bad I have had to return two of them because the bottoms rip off Not a lot but there is always the same exact part of the bottom of the shoe that rips off

Excellent Sport shoes I love it Under Armour brand

I have long been a fan of curry shoes My daughter who plays organized ball and I who play 5 6 days a week love them We agree Aside from underperforming curry 3 they have been very good Curry 4 was outstanding and Curry 2 is still a go to But the Curry 6 has beat them all The look is fire the cut is clean The comfort better than all previous If you are looking for a hit in lock down comfort court feel and looks this is the shoe

I have a lot of positive things to say about the Curry 6 The fit is great the traction is sharp even on dusty courts and the support is really good for such a lightweight shoe That being said I could never recommend this shoe to anybody because of the same glaring flaw that so many people are pointing outthe peeling fraying of the 2 piece outsole it is so bad that even Steph wears pairs that are a uni body construction After only TWO games of pick up I was already experiencing peeling on the outsole which is so bad that my trust in UA products is falling fast I had a similar issue with rubber tearing off of my Curry 5after limited use so I really hope UA is able to figure out their atrocious durability issues

it is a great shoe so far but I am cautious due to widespread complaints on durability

I felt like the Curry 6 was the most comfortable of the Curry line yet the Hovr technology has been impressive on the court I love the way the shoe feels wrapped around my foot I feel like you can stop and cut and change direction with ease they also feel very bouncy when jumping I love everything about the shoes also I purchased the curry 6 Fox Theatre Edition the 1st day they came out and I have been using them outdoors and they have been durable and the performance has been the same to this day from the 1st day I wore them

This is a gift to my 13 years old nephew he wears it try on the basketball court right away and felt in love with the shoes

Love playing in these shoes they are very comfortable and supportive

Best Curry shoe yet By far the most comfortable design and the most fashionable I have not experienced any problems at all Just ordered my 5th pair of white and blue Love them

Got it for my husband Arrived on time it is just what he asked for He loves it

Great shod comfortavle great stability No complaints from me

This is exactly what my son wanted He says they are comforting

Great product and fast delivery i only wished i ordered 2 more of these as they seem to be going as collector items i just want to wear these all the time because they look good and represent the fox theater oakland

These shoes are very well designed and comfortable I do not play basketball but wear these to work the gym and just walking around wherever I am surprised at the ankle support from a lower cut shoe The fit and comfort are spot on

I actually bought these SC in this color to match my SF Giants gear I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and the kind of wide front end of these shoes Very easy to slide on and off without tying the laces I Like how secure my foot feels in these Now my Grandson thinks I am cool Thanks

Love the shoe Good fit I ordered 1 2 size larger Comfortable solid ground feeling Good side support Avoid ankle tweak

I received the initial release Fox Theater colorway for my birthday they were ordered online These shoes would be used exclusively for AAU basketball tourneys this summer Because the shoes run wide we had to return them and the colorways available now do not appeal to me I use 10 12 pairs of game shoes so they will be replaced in the rotation by something else The shoes are very light and comfortable but my foot slid right out in my first warmup There was little ankle support with these shoes Many reviews discuss the lack of overall strength and longevity of these shoes but we were not able to find out I may try another pair if other more exclusive and attractive colorways are released

The shoe wears very stiff I definitely recommend ordering 1 2 to 1 size smaller than you normally would The support around the heel is great however the top of the shoe caused pain around that area of the foot The color selection is great and even better with the Icon option Traction has seen an improvement from the past release and the grip is pretty good

I bought these for my teenage son They are great shoes and are exactly as described Plus apparently they are the cool shoes for Junior High

Bought these while on vacation got home and they were definitely worth waiting for comfortable and wear nice

I own 3 pairs of these shoes The original red and yellow The originals I had to send back as the material seperated from the fabric around the toe No problems though the promptly refunded and I bought a new pair I was a little worried as I read lots of people having the same issues but so far the others have help up just fine Would recommend highly

My go to shoe been buying the past 3 years Great product

Hands down the best shoes I have owned Always highly satisfied with UA

Very comfortable shoes Fits well Price is reasonable

Nice performance for workout I do not play hoop but it is good for squat

I have been playing in Currythe past several years and always very happy and I was super excited to try the 6However after my first game I found the same problem as many of other people have found in the traction A portion of the bottom tore off This is after wearing this shoes once in my game on an indoor court I have 3 pairs of Curry 6 I have this issue with all 3

We got the package yesterday and when my son opened it the outsole beneath the toe area is damaged he is read some reviews and knows about the issue but for him to receive the shoe with the damage and have not even wore it simply blows our mind Shoe is great overall but to receive a damaged product is unacceptable What happened to the quality assurance before shipping the ordered product

All of his shoes are great but the curry 6 are the best

Hello Stephen Curry I have been trying to write this review for a while I am loyal to underarmour my first underarmour shoe was a running shoe I loved them so when I was going to get my first curry shoe I could not wait I based my game off of you but after the first 4 days the outsole gave out on me I was really disappointed when I had to trade in your shoe for a different one I really wanted to play and practice in your shoe so what I am trying to say is if you could fix the design of the outsole from ripping that would be amazing and the rubber from fraying easily that would be outstanding to thank you for reading this review from a loyal curry supporter

I wanted to love this shoe but it is durability issues are a major concern for me Once I started to get the shoes broken in the sole started coming apart as many other reviews have mentioned Keep in mind I have only had the shoes for two weeks Everything else about the shoe is perfect it is very lightweight and feels more like a running shoe but perform like a basketball shoe

Traction is amazing and when I rise up the shoe does not weigh me down since it is so light And one more thing that I want to address is that it hugs my foot so when I make a sharp cut my foot does not move inside the shoe Over all it is a great shoe

These shoes had so much protential one of the best looking shoes I have seen They are uncomfortable at first but I am sure would break in and conform to feet after a few uses UNFORTUNATLEY I have never worn a new pair more than once without them breaking As you can see with other photos the split outsole has ripped on every pair of shoes and I have had 3 pairs I have owned every curry shoe and try to love them but curry deserves a better signature shoe then one that breaks after the FIRST use

These shoes are the coolest looking most comfortable most functional shoes I have ever owned They fit my foot perfect Plenty of room in the toe which I like I think most shoes are too narrow Insanely light can not even tell I am wearing shoes Not quit as breathable as I hoped Overall a 5 star plus and I am not even morally allowed to be a Curry fan being from Cleveland and all Dude can shoot though I want all the colorways Please come out with more

Full time hoops coach who is on his feet daily Support and comfort are A as well Looking forward to more colors

First of all I have been playing in Curryfor pretty much last several years and always been very happy and I was super excited to try the 6However after 1 session of a shoot around I found the same problem as many of other people have found in the traction In fact the one I got completely tore off and nowhere to be found This is after wearing this shoes ONCE in a shoot around on an INDOOR court

Loved these shoes a bunch and really wanted to be able to write a good review too Despite hearing about all the issues with the traction pattern coming off of the shoes for other people I wanted to buy these anyways They fit great and were incredible on courthowever they only lasted until my second wear I looked down and unfortunately the toe box on my shoe was coming off Apparently I am not the only one with this problem

I am a big Curry fan and I love his shoes I have the Curry 4 5 and 6 I have two colorways for the 5and the 6but I would have to say that the 6are the best that Underarmor has come out with I love the Hovr cushion and the shoe locks your ankles in snugly These are by far the best shoes I have ever worn I love them and they provide excellent traction

Fits a little to big After the third use the outsole came apart Non durable what so ever

When this shoe first came out I was excited to buy a pair I bought the black color because of the style Once the shoe arrived I wore it for a few days and then actually played a one on one Basketball Game After just 10 minutes of playing the bottom of the shoe began to rip apart I returned the shoe and was sent another pair only to have the same thing happen again on the same day I put them on Sending this pair back and will wait to see what UA does

The first time I use the shoe the traction peels off with only 1 hr of use on in indoor court I was very disapointed because the shoe was a great preformer

This shoe could have been great I love the traction love the cushion light weight feels great on my feet I was really enjoying these but then I noticed the toe box where the outsole is glued together Only 10 games played max and it is starting to separate not only on my right but also left shoe Wanted to buy more pairs but it is pointless if the shoe will not last over a months use Very disappointed

Been wearing this shoe now for several weeks on the racquetball court since they were first released I have had several compliments on the look of the shoe which has been nice How does it fit and perform you askIt fits pretty darn good and conforms nicely to my feet but I need to are tie the shoes several times each game to keep it snug enough so my feet do not feel like there is slippage inside the shoe The laces are not that great The grip and traction of these shoes on the court is AWESOME Great for side to side and front to back movements during the game It really helps with quick cuts and getting to the ball But unfortunately my biggest complaint is that my feet ache and hurt after I have been wearing them for a while and when I take the shoes off the bottoms of my feet feel like I have run a marathon barefoot on concrete I thought this new HOVR technology was supposed to be all cushy and make my feet feel like they are cradled in clouds Guess not I will give them a few more weeks but may have to make a change to something more comfortable soon

Overall best Curry that UA has made but it seems as always there is slight room for improvement I will continue to be a loyal UA basketball customer

Played in a game and man the shoes did not last more than a quarter This is embarrassing This is your A brand athlete You gotta do better Man so disappointed I really liked the comfort so folks if you planning to hoop in these be aware it is a major flaw on the sole of the shoes

Just a wonderful basketball shoe Performance looks comfort etc Im giving it high marks in all categories Personally I miss and love those Curry high tops 1 2 and 4served me very well but these Curry low tops are really growing on me Im not even a guard but these shoes are serving me very well on the courtim playing fast and hard and this shoe can withstand all cuts and movement while Im playing I love the all black heart of the Town shoes a very unique colorway and I might have to cop these all red ones that im just seeing as well Im not really understanding these other comments that are criticizing the shoes durability because ive already played with my shoes 10 times for 2 hours at a time and they have easily held up just fineand i play hard too not halfheartedly Im still nostalgic about the Curry high tops that I used to ball with and still do some times but these low top Curry 5 and 6 have surprised me and Ive embraced them as my go to shoes when trying to get a run Keep it up UA there is always room for improvement but there are no glaring weaknesses and overall Im giving the Curry 6 a 9 10 and Im usually a strict grader

OUT OF ALL THE CURRYS I HAVE THESE ARE THE BEST ONES GREAT IN COMFORT PERFORMANCE GOOD GRIP AND BETTER ANKLE SUPPORT

I got these shoes one week ago and played in them twice on a nice wood court I have had them on about 1 5 hours total and the rubber on the bottom is totally peeling away and tearing off I see one other reviewer said the same thing I also thought it was very loose fitting and I could not get it tight enough This is my first time getting a low top shoe instead of the high top style I can say it feels good but for sure there is less padding So even though I play ball about 4 times a week I got blisters from both times of wearing these But shoes do take a little to break in so I would guess it would get better

I have worn these for about a weak now and I love them personally the sole on my pair is yet to be a problem although I am aware other people are having issues they did run a little big I wish I went half size down personally but not a big deal the traction is great but does require a wipe every once in a while The court feel is awesome which is something I look for in a shoe they are light have great traction and you really feel the court the cons the cushion is pretty minimal which personally does not bother me but I know other do not feel the same and I found they ran a little large

The HOVR cushioning is near perfection for performance The shoe is light and has very good traction UA has the sizing right as well Best Curry shoe to date

Just had spine surgery working on regaining my balance If this design can keep pro basketball athletes on their toes in the heat of an intense game then it is no problem to assist this old vet in regaining balance and sure footedness while rehabbing Nice snug fit easy on and off I feel like a pro when going through the rigors of negotiating stairs and lateral side stepping If I keep this up I may return to the court Thanks

I bought the Curry 6 on the release date 01 04 took a while to have them in my hands only because I live in Brazil and it would cost like BRL 999 00 which is almost 8 times more expensive then the US store This is my 7th basketball shoe and it is the best shoe I ever bought I heard about the midsole peeling off but I have been playing indoors and outdoors with it and nothing happend

The Curry 4 to me has the best traction of any Curry shoe The Curry 1 was the most comfortable to play in The Curry 6 takes those two things and mixes them together for the best curry model yet The traction is great on most surfaces and good on others The full length Hovr cushion that is present in the shoe is great for providing both impact protection but also a low to the ground feel The lacing system is something I have never seen before and it works to give you a unique 1 to 1 fit The stability in the shoe is superb as the wide base speed plate and heel counter provide great ankle support The materials are light and breathable yet durable So if you are someone looking for a stable shoe that provides you with impact protection light weight 1 to 1 fitting materials great traction at a good price this is definitely the shoe for you

The style of the C6catches your eye plus the insoles in the shoes feel like you are wearing the most comfortable pair of socksC6twothumbsup

I like the color and it makes me feel fast My jumpshot feels so much better and I feel like a pro

The best Curry sneakers to come out The traction and comfort is amazing Not to mention the amazing colourways

After using the curry 4 these feel amazing and i love the traction in these shoes They are super comfortable and even look better then before

These shoes have that retro 90look to it Which I totally dig And these are not common so I guarantee that you will start a wave with these fresh boys

My grandson wante these shoes for school they came right on time he loves them

I do not use my Huarches for physical activity they really are my favorite sneaker next to Air Max 90 Everyone who has ever own a pair knows that when you initially put them on its tough because of the built in sock After that they are super comfortable and very stylish the matte black with the vibrant purple and orange look great

If you are a fan of huaraches I would recommend these pair About to get me a pair in black soon

Very comfortable but hard to put on Mine slightly ripped in the heel area while trying to put them on

very light nice design only problem i had was that its a little narrow

The overall look of the shoe blows me away The shoes are very comfortable They are multi purpose shoes You could wear them to swag out or play sports in I highly recommend these shoes

Got this for my brother very stylish yet comfortable Definitely a classic

Great shoe and it fits just like my last pair I had YEARS ago

Feel good and fly I like the fit of them I love huaraches

Great shoe very stylish with great comfort Great product

I love the Huarache line I am always checking out new styles These shoes are excellent and provide comfort and stability alike These have a slightly narrow fit just like any other Huarache they do run small Get a half size up break these shoes in for a week and they will feel just fine I highly recommend this to anyone

Had these shoes when I was in middle school Been waiting on them to bring them back out They feel just like they did back in the day just like a glove Great shoe

The features of this product are great If you are looking for a great shoe to train in I suggest these Huaraches not to mention you will look pretty fly in them

This is a great sneaker but I recommend purchasing a half size bigger to improve comfort

Not the original colorway from 2000 but nothing has altered the shoes Still that amazing glove tight fit Cool Blue looks a lot darker in pic so actually look a lot better in person

Great looking shoe in a nostalgic colorway Like the 2001 retros go at least a half size up though This shoe fits like a glove I went from a size 13 to a size 14 without any problem I have a wide foot so keep that in mind

I liked all the packaging condition size performance

do not miss out This is one of the highest quality shoes I have recently bought very happy with suede quality and overall craftsmanship A

Runs narrow and snug on feet I ordered a size larger than I usually wear but after about two weeks of wearing them they are extremely comfortable I can wear them all day unlike other shoes I stopped buying Nike shoes because of their poor quality and how uncomfortable they are compared to New Balances However I do not like rocking my gym shoes 24 7 and do not like looking like a dad at 22 So I bought these They are made out of nice materials and look awesome I got the whites with red blue accents I never thought I could stunt so hard on these hoes being a Caucasian male

I would like to start by saying I bought this shoe a full size up knowing that the 95s have been historically narrow and knowing that my feet are wide and they are still a pretty snug fit for my feet I think the shoe tongue design is especially detrimental since the tongue has a collar that extends around your foot further compressing it which adds to a slight sense of discomfort

Pitch Black from top to bottom red tongue and windows These are 1st class Holding the air max to its highest potential for looks on these bad boys I do not wear them often bc Im a sneaker head and rotation is important Super air unit with the bounce and height to stand out on their own A must have or try Size is exact to fit

Sneakers fit true to size Very comfortable sneaker

Loved the colors used great quality super comfy and looks great on Husband will only wear the Nike Air Max shoes Each pair lasts a lifetime

Air Max 95 have always provided the best comfort

I got these for my husband for our 13th ANNIVERSAY he loves them they are so comfortable he has made them his work shoes I have to now order a second pair most precious gift I have gotten him he say

I neededa casual summer shoe This shoe looks great and fits great Has a classic look

This is a Super Comfortable Shoe at a more Comfortable Price How could you not Buy these Worth every Penny you can not go wrong

This is my first experience buying shoes online I am quite satisfied after 2 3 weeks I like being able to find all white shoes The fit was a little bit tighter than I anticipated because I usually wear wide shoes but they do not hit me as tight anymore

arrived at store on time and the shoes are comfortable

I bought the rose pair for my 13yr old son to play basketball in He loves them Says they fit great and have amazing traction

Was a little skeptical about the design of Kyries until this release Love the look fit is nice though a bit narrow on my foot and comfort is through the roof Seriously one of the most comfortable pair of Nikes I have ever owned Highly recommended

I work in a health care facility and needed a new pair of shoes The all black goes well for work and everyday clothes Comfort is perfect for being on my feet all day at work And I also work out at the gym with them

Great buy for my son to add to the collection Team Kyrie CUp

All black and lightweight make these a no brainer Color matches EVERYTHING And these fit like a soft glove Very fast with great support Great design Finish Line shipping was right on time too do not hesitate pick up a pair

I was looking for a shoe in black that had clean lines was versatile and comfortable I already had a pair of Kyries that I like but they have bright pink and yellow embellishment Plus those are at my regular size 11 which are a little tight for all day usage So I got these Kyrie Lows in black white and I am 11 5 I am glad I did because the price was great they are very very comfortable and go with just about anything I wear Highly recommend

I ordered these for my bf after he got a different pair Kyrie Flytrap that he LOVED so much These Kyrie Lows unfortunately he did not like quite as much so we returned them Fit and overall style were on point but the velcro strap stuck to the laces and would definitely shred them up over time

Bought these not only because they were on sale but i needed a black pair of sneakers to play sports and work out in They are pretty comfortable They have a good spring in them when balling But i would not recommend if your feet run wide They are very true to size

Love them very comfortable and clean look I will be buying another pair

Try on this shoe in store if possible or other kyrie shoes

My son picked these shoes for his birthday and he likes them He has them in the rotation of his weekly shoe rotation he is a Junior in HS He likes the fit they do not hurt his feet trekking all over school We would recommend them

JV basketball player loves them Comfort and good ankle support Light

My daughter has these in the floral print and after only wearing them a few weeks to school the white logo partially peeled off the tongue and got lost somewhere on the school grounds Very disappointing considering what I spent on them

A very good shoe to use for a player who does play a lot Specifically indoor as they do take a day or two of usage to break in Once broken in shoes have great traction and a great fit I do recommend going up half a size if you do not like a tighter fit

These shoes look great but do not perform very well on the court The sole is thicker than i would prefer i like to feel the court but the ankle support and lockdown on the foot is great The traction tears away pretty quick My foot started hurting after about 4 hours and needs constant wiping Still a pretty durable shoe though

Decent fit and minimal comfort but horrible durability After using the sneaker indoors for only a few weeks the whole sole started wearing out and became bald Very disappointing quality I would not recommend

Fits well and feels good until you make quick and low cuts A bit of heel slippage which would be fine if you tighten the laces up top however a combination of tight laces and the strap at the same location near the inner ankle creates discomfort I would recommend the regular Kyrie 4for a little bit more

So to be honest the black ones I ended up returning in exchange for the gold trimmed ones I liked the style and fit but the black ones under certain lighting made the fabric or material look plum purple and the inside of the shoe almost lavender So I exchanged before I even wore them once I am so glad I decided to get another pair vs quiting all together because these have been my go to shoe for work and running errands I love them

Just received them on Friday Ran my morning 5 miles like it was nothing Shoes are great

I have always stuck with airmax and have not been too happy with the vapormax as a replacement Purchased these after some research and reviews and I was very surprised They are very light and comfortable The cushioning and support are also great although I feel it is not as good as airmax for extended standing There are mixed reviews on fitment some say they are true to size but I did go a half size up due to wide feet Airmax always fit true for me I did try these in the store for fitment

I purchased these shoes to casually wear around when I know I will be doing a lot of walking now they are almost a daily shoe for me Very comfortable performance shoe they have a lot of cushion and support a lot of flex and softness to it and the best softest flyknit to date Definitely a must buy Shoe runs true to size I will be purchasing a second pair

Heel blew out after just a month Perhaps a defective pair but worth noting 165 pound male for what it is worth

I have been wanting a nice low profile shoe that I could shoot around in and then hit the gym I saw these and was concerned they might be too narrow like other Kobe reviews have said This model fits great probably the best fit I have had in a while The only reason they did not get a 5 star rating is because I think they could be a little softer soled Still a little hard to believe that Nike maker of Foamposite shoes has not used that as their standard cushion

I loved the color and the design on it And it was on sale for a great price as well I came I tried it and I never regretted it it is nice some people think it is a balenciaga lol do not know about that But great shoe

I liked the style and bought 4 different products from snkr project through Finish line This one has not even lasted up to like 3 weeks the top has already started to peel I was surprised as i thought it should take a while before this would happen but i guess i got what i paid I know they would probably not read this but this should help other prospective buyers They seemed to me like they were trying to get rid of all the collections

A pair that all sneaker heads should own I got mine

This is a very interesting shoe The moment i saw it released i was marveled by it i love the shoe being all black as i can match them with any outfit initially i was a little confused on the strap zipper and lacing system until after trying on the shoes i was able to figure out how they worked the air bubble is really comfortablethe padding in the rear of the shoe provides supreme comfort and protection for the achilles tendon i love the texture of the leatherit is very soft and does not crease easily making the shoe more durable i no longer play basketball but if i did this would be my go to shoe i have yet to wear them in public but i know i will turn heads when i do i am very satisfied with this shoe as i am with all nike products A

The color was off and they went back to the store

Amazing dad shoes super cozy can wear all day I would highly recommend these and for a 100 retail you can not beat it

Too orthopedic looking on feet Different colorway might be better but these are hard to pull off

They run a little big id recommend going a half size smaller Look even better in person

I would recommend the shoe to anyone looking to feel comfort

do not like product very poor sole and tread

I liked my purchase so much I originally purchased it for my boyfriend that I ended up buying a second pair for myself that is how great they were

One of the most comfortable shoes that I have ever bought

Inexpensive and comfortable Took me 3 trys to finally get them but glad there here

Comfortable and great quality Love this brand and recommend to everyone

I had been looking for the perfect running shoe for years and now have finally found it

I like it that is due to being lightweight and very comfortable while running

Very comfortable nice looking shoes and cheap price

In my profession I have to stand up sometimes for 13 hours a day and these shoes feel good The color the fit and especially the support The shoes looks good too The material is soft and moves when I move Thank you

These shoes fit a little bit big on me but overall I like them I would buy them again if given the option

Fits me perfect length wise and width wise But it in terms of height it lacks depth It feels tight around the tongue area I feel like it I had purchased this one instore than I would have gone half a size up to compensate

They look and feel awesome on my feet I want to buy more adidas has great deals

Bought for work at gym great comfort and breathability Holds up to all the running around I have to do

I have wide flat feet and have stayed away from tennis athletic shoes for nearly 10 years but then I found these shoes to be a complete game changer After a decade of wearing nothing but skate shoes I am thoroughly enjoying the comfort these Duramoare delivering

The hard plastic in the show was digging into the top of my foot

Contrible snickers like so much will buy it again

I love the color and how well they fit They are also not bulky

The shoes look to big despite it fitted me I purchased size 10 5 and the shoes size appearance look 12

Great price for great quality Would buy again at this price

Great price and the look of the shoe is pretty good

I found the Duramo 9s to fit really well as well as being very comfortable I would recommend these shoes to a friend

These are shoes for the price They could have a thicker sole for my preference

This is a very comfortable pair of running shoes with good cushioning The style is cool too

Very happy with the shoe Lived up to my expectations

I Love Adidas Product Because they are Affordable and comfortable

Quality is really poor Really uncomfortable not suitable for sports hiking or just a walk my feet And legs really hurts after using them Horribles Sorry about that I love adidas and I think your shoes are amazing but not this one

Very comfortable worth the buy stylish triple black can not go wrong

Great shoes for working out and can match any outfit

nice look comfortable shoes very black color makes them perfect for business casual dressing

Great Price Great Shoe A lot more than I expected

Because there good shoes and very affordable next leave it more cheap economical Berber Sanders 2020 baby

Very comfortable light weight Mesh is great for circulation Would buy again

These are honestly so comfortable They fit well and are easily to wear around the whole day A nice breathable material that feels good throughout the day rather than get uncomfortable

The comfort and quality of the shoes are great I have always loved wearing Adidas shoes because of the cloud foam soles

Sleek and stylish Great buy for the money

Shoe is comfortable and light Bought for basketball refereeing and it is a great choice

For the price of the product I have no complaints it is comfortable just that size 10 is too narrow

Very comfortable but already coming apart after 2 weeks

The shoes are fine and would probably be comfortable but for the opening were the laces start it is much to tight to be comfortable and the tongue is not wide enough to cover my foot from the plastic piece the laces loop through

They are so comfortable and they look great thanls

Very comfortable and durable great purchase What more can I say

Nice affordable shoe that I can walk hours in and not irritate my knees one of which has been totally replaced These shoes make me feel like I am walking on air

These shoes are comfortable the material is durable and they look great in all black The only bad thing is they run a little big maybe a 1 2 size if that

It is a comfortable shoe for working and or running

Perfect shoes for being on your feet all day I purchased these for my retail job as a salesfloor associate where i am constantly on the move They are super comfy and fit like a glove

I would buy this product again if my son asked me to

Shoe is a touch narrow but not a deal breaker Breaking in nicely Adidas are the best shoes hands down Cant beat this price

I like the order because I am a coach and we signed a contract with adidas so that is all I wear now

When I look for a shoe I have to be comfortable and this shoe at its price is a good shoe to just have as anaround the house shoe or a shoe that is good for all of the daily activities

Lived upto expectations

Fits perfect and comfortable and perfect color

Good looking and comforable shoe but the tread on the outsole is very thin It started wearing out after just one week of running on roads and pavements Also it barely offers any traction in wet conditions

pricing different online vs app overall good but for the price

Color is awesome looks so classic and stylish

I like them because they are perfect to walk and jog

Very nice and confortable style with an affordable price

best shoes my boyfriend loves them he wears them almost everyday

The shoes are very comfortable in general I am not a big fan of the design on the pull tab but it is ok

Great shoe with great comfort I would recommend this shoe for anyone who wants needs a good cushioned shoe

Met expectation Good style Good quality Look forward to using

This seems to be a well made durable shoe runs a little large

The only thing i did not like was how low the heel felt on my foot

Super comfy shoes I am always on my feet at work so it helps

I like the material that was made but do not like they run 1 size smaller than my actual size

I enjoyed the product it is a good show but had to buy a bigger size shoe because my size was not available

Okay shoe and the price was great along with delivery

Looks cheap and dimensions are huge very wide wish I could return them for another selection

Good shoe to run around the track Bought for sons track practice

Very comfortable Looks great enjoyed the presentation Thank you

Great quality shoe for a great price Highly recommend for an everyday shoe

Shoes feel great got them for doing some outdoors activities like hiking etc But I find myself wearing them all the time the cloud foam is amazing A lot of people say the shoe is too wide which it runs a little wide but there are another set of lace holes that are for people with a little less width in their foot 100 worth the buy

Awesome price for an awesome shoe The price comfort looks=WIN Thanks Adidas

I brought for my husband and he said they were very light on his feet

Very comfortable for work Great for the price Loved the style

I hate the way they look but their so comfortable

Comfortable and durable shoe and great shoe for the workplace as well

These shoes are high quality for the price They are also very comfortable

Super comfortable I wanted to buy an additional pair but they were sold out

I stand all day it fits the bill Good product and I recommend this sneaker

Great price comfort and look The delivery was earlier than expected

I like the products very good on my feet looks good I like good outfits

They are not comfortable at the top rubs on my instep hard plastic for shoe laces are not flexible and hurts my feet

it is really nice i would recommend it to my friend

I like the color and comfort nice all around shoe

The quality is good and the materials are comfortable

Great quality for the price Would be nice if adidas had non slip version of these or something similar to these in nonslip

Bought these for work and they make my feet hurt worse than any shoe I have ever had

Super comfy shoe for the price I am able to wear a smaller shoe to get the width I need

It is comfortable fits well light for walk running

Its comfortable and stylish at the same time which is something not all shoes have

Would highly recommend to a friend and make more purchases from this site

The shoe has held up to my very physically demanding job and kept its comfort throughout

perfect for my job when I am standing on a hard floor

Provide absolutely no heel Achilles support when a lot of flex is exerted

Great quality shoes Very comfortable They are constructed well My son loves them

So comfy and effortless to walk around in And they match everything

My son loves these he has a wide foot and he said they are very comfortable

Bought for my son Versatile sneaker with a clean design

I like the comfort and style and reasonable price

Not a good shoe you could do better not HAPPY WITH WHAT I GOT

Rigid plastic strip for laces is apparently causing me a lot of foot discomfort

Satisfied with the Sporty look My choice for the Black on Black

Great fit have a wider foot and this shoe does not constrain my toes

Very comfortable Quality is great would buy again

Nice cushion and fit for the price point Recommended

If you do a lot of walking moving running this shoe is not for you it is not even comfortable just for a throw on shoe to get up and go The price is why I purchased it but it is not a comfortable shoe at all

Found Duramo 9 to be a very comfortable shoe and am quite pleased with itso far

Size is perfect and really lightweight

My friend really liked the comfort and size Good shoe for people with wide feet They run a little large so order accordingly If you are on the 1 2 size order that instead of going up

I like looking so nice and very comfortable sooo good

This is the 2nd pair of Duramo 9 I got I am looking for more in my size I am a stickler for comfort I do alot of walking and always look for an amazingly comfortable shoe Well these are it They are so soft on the inside and there is more than enough padding to ensure you are comfortable The width is perfect as I have a slightly wider foot and I am not uncomfortable

shoes inner sole is not properly placed its looks good but not finished well

Affordable purchase great product Nice and comfortable shoes

This shoe seems quite durable and provides decent protection for the price

Solid shoe great materials super comfortable The best part is the shoes breathe very well ventilation wise

Because are so light and I am not got tired when I walk for hours

The shoes themselves were very comfortable but there was these plastic pieces on the side that every time I turned my foot they rubbed it raw I returned them but I still have huge sores on the side of my ankles

It a gift and the person really appreciate it He loves it

Very comfortable Durable Just a little too wide but not annoying A great shoe for the price I paid

I fell in love with these the minute I slipped them on and they run wide which is great Pretty light too However I found that mine runs about a half size too big this is also my first pair of Adidas and not used to how the sizing is I am right between a 10 1 2 and 11 and went with the 11 and they felt like a 11 1 2 or 12

Best brand most comfortable you will not fine a better value for your money

The shoes are very comfortable there right fit and great all around

Material felt pretty cheap Kinda plasticky Also was very uncomfortable

They are the best and the most important thing is the quality I sincerely love

Adidas makes the best shoes and these are super comfortable love the all black

Looks Good Very Comfortable Great Price for what i purchased

Great price Comfy and great looking I usually purchase wide does but these feel great

I like the product because it is comforable and it is an excellent price

Got these for my boyfriend He works on his feet and is always looking for a good pair of all black shoes that he can stand in for long period of times without cr and Ing up He just told me that we should of bought 2 pairs He is really happy with these shoes

Very light and comfy The cloud foam does the trick with these In a word these are CLEAN These have adjustable shoelace slots for adjusting the width so narrow and wider feet alike can wear these

I am able to comfortably fit my orthodics in these shoes This is difficult with most athletic shoes

I really like the shoes for working out or walking and they are really affordable good job adidas keep it up

Comfortable and roomy I like that there wide I would buy again

Great shoe going to buy a second pair for me and for my spouse

The shoes are comfortable to use while working out

I love my current Adidas shoe and was trying to replace it After fishing through each picture on the website I thought I had it Another reviewer had said they run wide But it was not the same shoe and did not run wide They were very uncomfortable I am returning it and will now go elsewhere to find a new pair of shoes

Great purchase They worked out perfect for my son

It look great on my feet and I like it It very comfortable

Really great shoe for everyday walking and use Very comfortable and provides good cushion

Cant beat the price as well

Good fit comfortable shoe Hoping they will stand the test of time

These are great looking sneakers the only problem is that they are narrow The souls are nice and spongy like you are walking on on a cloud

Comfort level is off the charts The material used for shoe lace may cause some irritation for users with a wider midsole

Purchased for work because I am always on my feet moving They are my second pair of CloudFoam adidas A adidas

Probably the most confortable shoe I own Looks great but the quality seems a little on the low side like it may not last that long but I hope it does I would recommend this shoe

All sizes are whole Poor no halves And a little wide

I use it to go to the gym but its very good everyday shoes also

it is a good fit it looks good Just all around good shoe No complaints

I am female I bought mens shoes because some of the womens shoes toe box is too narrow and my foot is slender so I can not buy a wide width I have flat feet and these were so comfortable

Thx

The Duramo 9 offers comfortable athletic fashion a good value The breathability is great if your not in the rain or puddles

I love Adidas products This new purchase is a great and comfortable shoe

Service was fast and the quality of the shoe are great Useing them as workout shoes as of now and they feel outstanding

These shoes look ok and fit nicely However they have a crease in the front part of it This happened after an hour of wearing them The quality of the materials holding the shoe shape is just awful

I would definitely recommend this sneaker to a person who is athletic

For the price they are very mediocre shoes Not the most comfortable but that does not mean they are uncomfortable I just needed all black shoes that I can wear everywhere without worrying about getting them dirty and these fit that bill

I bought them because of the low price did not really think much about these shoes But they are my dailys now I wear these shoes every day to work because they are comfortable They let your feet breathe they have cloudfoam on the bottom and they fit really nice on my feet Very discreet shoe

Clean looking sneaker very comfortable and the price is great

Great comfort Nice look I use it at the gym good for weight training Fits good on my feet

super comfy my son loves his new sneakers size is kind small but overall perfect

Very comfortable stylish and they look good with anything I wear

they are a bit too wide in size other than that they are very comfortable and pretty good quality

My shoe fits perfect and makes it easier to walk and stand in

I wish I would have purchased more colors

I would recommend these shoes they are comfortable I have had them on for 2 weeks

I wore these all day at Disneyland Park Comfortable and affordable

it is a great show but it is a little to narrow for my feet

My boyfriends first pair of Adidas and he loved loved them The perfect fit style and comfort gave him the reassurance he needed to buy more Adidas sneakers soon

They fit perfectly and feel great I will definitely purchase these again as long as they are available

Does feel secure on my foot the front end of the shoes has a weird gap and has a an awkward look to the front the remind me of anti slip shoes

2nd pair use them for work On my feet all day and gives them the support and comfort i need

You can never go wrong with Adidas

Love how these look Comfy yet seem durable and will last

The shoes are great makes me run faster and very comfortable

Bought this product for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it

Very comfortable shoe for the purpose I use them for

Looks orthopedicish oh yeah they are I did not see that in the description but they are comfy not stylish by far

I wear these at work where I walk a good bit These shoes are a great deal for the price They have held up well so far giving me good grip cushion and comfort

Because they are comfortable and made with quality

Order about 1 size up because I wear a 9 but that was too small so had to reorder to a 10 and that was prefect

ProsThe shoe has perfect sizing and are very comfortable with rich color Consnot breathable kinda cheap materials When you look closely in sunlight its a little embarrassing Verdictnice very comfortable shoe for the money Time will tell about durability

These are super comfortable shoes I am on my feet 9 hrs at work and they are amazing Get them

He said these were one of the best shoes he owned and on top of them had a streamlined look to them

I believe it is a good shoe for the price definitely enjoyed it

If I put a Gel soleBoy what would it be Heaven

This is a great sneaker for the price will using at the gym often

Love how they feel on my feet Very light and comfortable

Amazing shoes and very comfortable to wear as well

The shoes are super comfortable to walk on The only thing that I did not like is that the Plastic part of the shoe where the shoe strings go kinda sticks out and the edge is a bit sharp So sometimes it digs into my skin and scratches me That is the only thing that I do not like about the shoes Other than that they are great to walk on and are super comfy

They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I run 6 miles every morning and my knees have always hurt but with these shoes they do not

it is comfortable and light I recommend this shoe to others either work or casual

I have had these for a few months and i work 8 hours on my feet and their super comfortable

Pretty decent shoes they look better on feet Kinda chunky shoes but overall not bad Pretty comfortable Got them on sale so I am happy

these shoes are long lasting and they are also comfortable

Great quality I expect from Adidas Always fair pricing Great comfort

I have had a few different pairs of adidas shoes I recently purchased these within the last 3 months and the plastic component that holds the laces in place broke already These are great looking shoes and they are great for my jobI am just sad that I will have to purchase a new pair of shoes so quickly Unfortunately I may not choose adidas with my next purchase Shown in the photo I had to stitch them with surgical sutures until I can go purchase a new pair of shoes

Very light and super comfortable Great for long standing and for long walks and runs

This is a comfortable shoe the price was very reasonable I will purchase the same shoe again

I liked the tennis use until today to go to the gym it is very comfortavel

Confortable light weight fresh looking and price

They are very good looking and perfectly comfortable I get compliments all the time

Thought i was buying womens shoes so they are a little big

I can not recommend or not recommend at this time I have only worn them twice Once I figure out how to lace up the top area and break them in a little more I will be able to let you know

I give this as a gift to my son and he is very happy with the shoes

it is very comfortable and fits perfectly they also last long

it is a value for money purchase Really good one

I can use them for anything and they are very comfortable

Follow my on instagram jaesogoofyyyy Definitely worth buying a great shoe for running



I am happy to have this running shoes It is one of the best running shoes in my collection I strongly recommend this shoes who loves high quality

shoelaces always untying Adidas were is your quality control

It is not comfortable Sometimes it makes me hurt

These shoes were great just too big for my son We sent them back and he decided on something different

Shoe sqeaks when I walk but otherwise are very comfortable and durable

I love it I have the triple black and it is so functional and stylish at the same time it is so soft and bouncy and I have no qualms running a good 6kms in one go

I am a professional flooring guy that being said I go through a lot of shoes These by far are the most comfortable shoes I have had in a long time have not even had a tear in them yet either Usually the mesh lasts me 1 week before it starts to rip Very satisfied with these shoes

GOOD PRICE COMFORTABLE AND ELEGANT STYLIST COMBINE ALL WEARING

You do not even know your in a pair of shoes so comfortable

I can honestly say that the first time I tried them on I felt like my feet were in heaven I will definitely buy another pair soon Adidas is the best

I intended to wear these for my running training but they look so good I also wear them with a casual urban look On top of that they are ultra comfortable

They look fresh and nice for quick trips not being to much on your feet Look periods of walking feel uncomfortable

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had I work in a warehouse where I walk around miles a day The sole feels like I am floating on clouds The tongue on the back of the shoe also makes them very easy to put on without any struggle Lastly they look just as amazing as they feel

These shoes are like walking on clouds Very comfortable

I love these sneakers the fit perfect and are ultra light

i work at finishline in Fredericksburg Va and the shoe is so amazing very very light super comfortable As soon as I put the shoe on it was like walking on a pillow Nike team all day baby

Shoes look great with shorts or jeans I was impressed that I ordered additional color ways Would recommend to anyone

These slides are beautiful By far my favorite I really recommend these to anyone who loves NIKE

Nice looking shoe but the design with the plastic piece across the top hurt my foot and seemed to obstruct the laces Seems to fit small and narrow Great looking shoe but structure needs an upgrade

Very nice casual shoe First time wearing them they were not really comfortable but after a couple days i can wear them all day long Were a little too big might want to try half a size down but i did not mind

Looks great but make your feet hurt so bad can not wear them all day Feet has a heart beat if you do

Shoes look nice and they wear in nicely These shoes in white are versatile and simple while still having details that draw in the eye If you want something more simple go with Stan Smiths Comfort is not anything to get excited about but they are still pretty comfortable In terms of sizing true to size if you want a little wiggle room and half size down for a more snug fit Overall these are a great everyday shoe as they are stylish versatile and comfortable You also can not beat the price

Great Silhouette Leather feels great can pull off great outfits with them

Shoe fits TTS Pretty comfortable Was slightly scuffed when it arrived but not a big deal to me I plan on purchasing in other colors

I love these shoes They have a timeless design that will never go out of style and the quality is amazing I have bought these over and over again and I will continue as long as they sell them

These shoes look great and feel great Only thing is that its leather so it can be scratched easily

Nice clean kicks for spring summer Run about a 1 2 size bigger than other adidas kicks I own

Exelent product very nice color way and beautiful style

So i tried on these shoes in the store was unsure of the style and look but decided to buy them anyway After i broke them in and walked around a bit I am so glad I bought these Very comfortable and they fit great I bought the white ones and its a nice clean look Would definitely recommend

this is a well worth it purchase strong and durable as well as fashionable strongly recommend

The shoes are very comfortable and they are good looking 20 10

it is comfortable and it is a very good design You can use it for many outfits

I was initially happy with these but after wearing them for one day I was disappointed the inside wall started bulging out in the middle I would not purchase these again

Comfortable and the color is to die very nice shoe I would recommend this to everyone go out and get a pair

I liked that it is a sleek simple model that is versatile with almost anything and the leather is decent tumbled leather i am not going to lie but you guys have to be more aware of quality control because some pairs are defective shoes I had to return these twice before I could wear them due to one shoe being worn out and the other one being brand new and the second time it was a chip on the toe box feel big in my regular size 9 5 had to go down half a size Been using for two days straight to see how they feel and they are good for a model that does not have boost

Great shoe for any casual occasion Looks good no matter how to choose to style it

It has that classic look and it is really comfortable and the price is just right for the shoe since almost everyone can buy it

Has it ever occurred to you to make larger like up to 15 and wider say 4E shoes

I ordered these online and when they arrived they were very tight and uncomfortable in the toe area I figured they just needed to be broken in a little NOPE They are just tight and I even got a 1 2 size bigger than I normally wear To top it off the insole began falling apart in just a couple weeks and the rest to the shoe seems to be of pretty shoddy quality I put my old Sambas back on and have been wearing them since I love Adidas but this product needs revision

I have been really wanting these shoes for so long I bought a pair for my brother a couple of months ago and now I finally have my own I saw a few reviews that said that the fit was a little big but mine fit perfectly The comfort and quality is great as well The only problem that I had with mine were that out of the box they were a little dirty and had a few stains but thankfully I was able to remove them Even with that I still love my new shoes

it is very comfortable The quality looks ok but PLEASE ADIDAS CHECK THE FINAL PRODUCT It arrived with a lot of traces of glue I would exchange but I am going on a trip and I really need the shoe

Great purchase Very cute I would recommend ordering about half a size smaller than your normal shoe size I am an eight for every other shoe I own so that is what I ordered but they are a little loose Keeping them because there are no smaller sizes to exchange for but just a heads up Still love them

I recommend this shoes Looks good and very comfy Quality of this product seems good

I must of exchanged these shoes a million times and adidas kept sending me a pair of shoes that were not identical left shoe was new and nice and the right shoe looked slightly different and was used and worn out I really like the look of these shoes if I could only just get a pair of new identical shoes that would be amazing

I love it because it gives a great vibe while still appealing to comfort and functionality

High quality leather and nice firmness to the body of the shoe

it is stylish affordable and comfortable What more could you ask for

Absolutely fantastic looking shoes with great comfort and aesthetic

I love these shoes they are classics They look great and they feel comfortable They also stay white for a long time if you take care of them

Super comfy shoes overall and super easy to wear would buy again

Shoes were way too big and way too wide Definitely a men shoe not unisex as advertised Returned shoes Too bad

These shoes are so cool they work for men and women I sized 1 5 down to convert to womensizing and they are a little snug but not unwearable Very comfortable and I get a lot of compliments

Lather is so soft and comfortable and easy to clean

The color is great the look is old school which I love

Sleek retro but still very IN Comfortable too and nice height for sure

Shoes looked really good on pictures but they are smaller and way narrower than my other adidas shoes They are extremely uncomfortable

Good quality throwback shoe that goes great with today fits

The shoes go with like any pants and they are easy to keep clean

Sneakers fit great and look good Nice all leather upper and comfortable soul A definite keeper

Bought these because my superstars were died and figured these would work well it was much better than I thought Great look to them and functional

Looks good and comfortable and it is beautiful design

Simple design but classy looking shoes that fit great

I like because is very simple design feat perfect

I normally wear a size 7 in women and bought these in size 5 5 They are a tiny bit big but overall I do not regret

I like this product because it gives what I want It is over all a nice shoe

This shoe is perfect for style If ur looking for something to wear to a night out or a day a work it is perfect because it looks great It is also pretty comfortable and perfect for those types of occasions

I recommend these because I like the style and they are pretty comfortable

it is a lifestyle it is how you feel about yourself every day what you wear when you face life tough challenges Adidas

Like the red stripe on the side of the all black shoes Have worn classic black with white stripes and liked having something different

It goes good with almost anything I wear and a very simplistic shoe

These shoes are fire They go with just about anything That is all

I like the style of the shoe a lot and it is very comfortable I did have a little issue with the delivery

These shoes are a great buy they are really cool and they are comfy I have wide feet and they fit great

These shoes are so cool They look vintage but also modern My fiance loves them and how versatile they are

good shoes I really like the texture and feel of the shoes

This shoes are the most accurate for training they will help you to reach your goals absolutly

They are slightly bulkier than expected but they are not bad I recommend

Well done I have loved all Adidas products I have purchused

These run big and they are rather uncomfortable I believe it is because the poor quality materials used I would pass on these

Looks great and feels great They have become my favorite pair of shoes

Not the most comfortable but pretty good overall

I gave them to my boyfriend as a gift and he absolutely loves them

I like these because they are such a classic clean shoe

Great shoes Arrived a bit later but it fits nice Would recommend

Really comfortable and casual shoes for everyday Took a week to arrive but Was worth the wait

They look so nice in person They are super trendy and so comfortable

Our son said they are very comfortable We bought them for him for Christmas Only problem is his brother got him the same ones

Got what was advertised like the look of the shoe

It has a good look I like the color and the feel inside is great

Feels like foot is meant to be in these shoes Aside from the perfect fit the color is great and the weight of the shoe is not heavy

I really like this product because of the fit and the style

Phenomenal shoes Great fit comfortable and slick I do recommend

I was disappointed that the size seemed to be a whole size and a half bigger than expected

My Granddaughter asked for them for Christmas and she says they fit perfectly

I love these shoes They are a beautiful 80s throwback the leather is soft and rich the footbed is comfortable and welcoming

This is just a classic looking shoe that is ready to dress up or dress down

I am a womens 9 8 in adidas womenSo I got these pink Continental 80s in a size 7 and they are perfect for me Like with my Superstars these are so comfy once you break them in Hands down my favorite pink sneaker I have because they are made the best and are the most foamy comfortable AND stylish Adidas is the best

The shoe is a casual design that you can dress up or dress down

Super comfy Great color Trendy and awesome Love

The shoe itself is great but if you have wide feet I would recommend breaking it in ver well

Cool shoe and easy to rock with anything Cool colorways as well

A good quality and comfortable everyday pair of sneakers

The show feels good on my foot but since they run large parts of the shoe rub against my foot and can make wearing them a tad bit uncomfortable I would buy the yellow or gray shoes again

I like this product because of its high quality design and modest price

One of the best looking sneakers around and they also feel great

Its a really great shoe all around It looks really good and its so stylish

Once I received my shoes I saw that they were creased really bad already

Amazing leather great shoe would buy again The fit is perfect highly recommend

The sizing is off very tight had to get bigger than usual

Incredibly comfortable quality material I got 2

it is simple and works with almost any outfit since they are white

Comfortable looks great great to walk White goes with everything Leather creases a little too much but it is leather

My niece loves the throwback looks These are unisex and great Anybody can rock them and super comfy

I like the materials of the continentals 80 a bit narrow but great

Very comfortable shoe I love how it looks Fits perfectly

This continental 80 adidas shoes is one of the best classic style I recommended

But the number of characters for a review too long

Good price range for a good shoe is not uncomfortable only problem is that the back of my sock runs against the back of the shoe and somehow it ruins my socks

Good looking shoe but may be a tight fit for flat or wide feet Stretching has helped a bit but the comfort does not approach Stan Smith levels and definitely not Boost levels

nice vro i really like these shoes and they are comfortable af

Super comfortable fit with a stylish look that compliments my athletic wear as well as street wear

These sneakers are very comfortable and great quality Very happy with my purchase I bought the pink and my husband got the white

i like the color of the shoe its basic but it works

Very comfortable sneakers soft leather and awesome design

True to size Comfy af Decent cushion in the midsole and really soft leather upper Get them

These shoes are awesome First day wearing them I got nothing but compliments Great price too

it looks like the kanye calabasas yeezy and good looking shoe

The leather is softer than other brands that have retro classic styles This is great cause it is more forgiving with wide feet like mine My problem now is how can I hold back from getting all the colorways for my collection

It ran true to size for me Feeling of the shoe is amazing and can go with any outfit I have the off white cream colorway and it looks great

They look amazing and fit the arch of my foot perfectly Very comfortable

Comfort and style Just the way I like it classic

They were great Worn them every day since Only thing I would change is I would exchange them for the beigeish colored pair but you all were out of stock but these were nice as well

I like it for its looks quality comfort and its cool factor

I love the comfort price quality and color selection of these shoes We bought three pair

I liked it because of the quality and design The overall look was really nice and everyone complemented on the shoes

I really love adidas shoes and they came in only 2 days which cames as a big surprise to me

I like the brand for their comfort and styles Great walking running footwear just fits whatever lifestyles you are in

My husband said they are a little hard inside but he loves them

Perfect look and style Top notch quality A little narrow

Nice and comfortable summer shoes maybe a little bit to thick but nothing to woried about

it is the perfect pink Very comfortable and super stylish I get compliments on them all day

Extremely comfortable and nice looking Would definitely buy again

Very cool shoe to just go out and have a good time

These shoes are a classic and look just as good as they did when they first came out The shoe is made of really high quality leather and look amazing on foot

it is a nice shoe it goes nice with regukar jeans and adidas pants

These are a little narrow but they look great I if you are looking for a great shoe look no further Best bang for your buck

Has a good look and feel to it Recommend to anyone that has a laid back look

This product is perfect I love the design and the quality of it all The leather quality is so good for the price Abd people love when I wear them

These shoes look great but they are way too narrow for me Unfortunately addidas does not offer these shoes in wide sizes Unfortunately I must return them

I really recomend them they are one of the most comfortable shoes i have

I used this same shoe in the late 80s to play tennis and loved it The new yellow color is awesome Super stylish

Comfortable good sizing I would recommend to friends

These shoes are so comfy straight out of the box I love they are not stark white the blue tint makes them look a little old school Just a great shoe

Shoe looks and feels great Only issue is that it is stiff at first and hard to break in

I like the style as well as the color Not too flamboyant yet very classy

Comfortable and Attractive gotten quite a few compliments on these shoes

Overall a great shoe but if you have wide feet they may be a tad narrow

They look amazing Retro They fit to size I have had so many people compliment me

Weird in the sides but good quality and very good

Great looking shoe it does fit a half size too big for me though

Just check size IMO were a bit too big I wear 8 5 and purchased 8 5 and I believe an 8 would off been better

classic clean comfortable runs small so half size up shoe is good for all occasions

The color is amazing It definitely pops out and stands out

Product came in just in time for a gift And he loved them

They are quite comfortable the material is very good and I like the style

My son loved the shoes They are comfortable and very stylish

They fit great feel great and look great The only problem is they crease but it is ok because I can wear them with basically anything

These shoes look great are not too bulky and are very easy to clean Highly recommend snagging a pair of these

Classic style great material excellent fit Not sure what else can be said other than buy a pair

Reminds me of the Reebok back in the day Bought them for my son I liked them so much I bought myself a pair in the pink

The quality of thise shoe is very nice and the shoe locks like the yeezy power phases

The design is nice but the leather used creases as soon as you take them out of the box They are a little narrow and the quality is a bit low for the price These would be a lot more updated looking in heavy canvas or suede Not a fan of shoes that crease and look like thrift store shoes after a day of wear

they look better than expected love them great addition to my wardrobe

I like the color and design it is something that I really want it

Love the shoes Classic Fits well Goes well with Jeans

They are very trendy except when they came they looked more blue

Sizing is not great otherwise good shoe although some of the glue is coming undone after two wears on the front

The style is perfect

Excited to wear this out Definitely will be the new go to weekender classic

I absolutely love the color way and old school tennis vibe

Great shoe Comfortable Similar to Stan smiths or superstars but a lot less mainstream and a softer material Color very unique Tint of blue Gets a lot of compliments and is great for the price

Retro tennis shoes with better support than Stan Smiths Nubbed sole gives excellent grip on the court

See above reviewFinally found a pair of sneakers that are comfortable and reasonably priced too

Favorite adidas shoe yet release more colorways please

Make sure you get the right sz because they are wider at the toe and run at least a half sz larger

matching with my guy love the leather the pink and the size is perfect

Go with everything fit and feel great for the price classic style

The shoes look nice but they have a texture that makes them look creased If you are into that then go for it But if not maybe go for a different style

I love the color and style of the shoe but I wish the body of the shoe was a bit thicker so it would not crease quit so much when walking

I like them a lot I was gonna but the pink ones but ended up buying the light blue ones and I love them Totally recommend them

an easy white sneaker that you can wear with any outfit

Great shoe and looks awesome if you keep them white

Great cheap basic shoe to go with nearly anything you can think of

Great looking shoe very easy to match with any outfit Comfort wise wish there was a bit more arch support

i like this product because of the feel of the sneaker and how it looks

Nice fit looks great will buy more and in diferent colors

I loved the style and I felt them really comfy at the store but I started using them and they are incredibly tight and painful to wear I do not know what to do I saved up for this and now I can only look at them

did not even need to break them in My feet are big so the leather folds a lot That may bug some buyers but I like it

I am a huge fan of the 80s and it was a perfect throwback

My son loves his new sneakers When he is happy I am happy

The shoe color matches very well with the website plus the shoe is a little wider than most shoes I have bought Thanks very nice as a man with large feet size 13 Would definitely recommend this shoe for purchase and at the price point it was releases at it is a no brainer This shoe is a steal

The stitching inside the shoe was very rough and uncomfortable once you put it on

Shoes fit perfectly I wear a size 14 so sometimes fit can be off but these are great Look amazing too Been getting compliments since i put them on Ordering a couple more pair in different colors

did not like the style but they were very comfortable

I bought these shoes because I liked the Yeezy Powerphases so much but these are not their equals as much as I had hoped pretty good everyday shoes or beaters but not for me

I love how it fits my legs and how it looks when i wear it

Inside toe stitching was very rough and shoes ran wide Also looked like leather outside would be difficult to keep clean

I Like the product because of the color and very comfortable

Nice fly Og Best Og Shoe Out right now and keep making sz 14  or 15

Aesthetic wise this sneaker is on point Comfort wise it is alright I am normally a size 5 5 in womenadidas so I got a size 4 expecting it to run a little loose The left shoe was so much more narrow than the right and I had to use shoe stretchers to fix it Maybe I just got a bad batch

Perfect shoe to pop any plain outfit Love the retro style of the shoes as well

Comfort stylish all around great shoe I am a huge adidas fan I will continue to be an adidas customer Just wish some of the limited product was for NJ also

This a legit shoe to have in the rotation Obviously not as comfy as boost but still a clean shoe to wear

Not good at all Shoes were frayed and I am hesitant to order again online

Best shoe adidas has out right now Best shoe adidas has out right now

I wish these were just slightly wider in the tie box but they are close to perfection

I love th love the OG look and they are super comfortable This might be one of my fav adidas

Very comfortable and stylish I bought the black ones

Great product Glad they brought these back and will definitely pick up another pair next summer Keep it flowing

Good quality shoe would advise to wear as a good shoe and not to get them really dirty

I only wear ADIDAS Originals sneakers I love the look and feel of these shoes and get a lot of compliments on them They are the perfect throwback to my 80s childhood and relevant enough that my 15yr old son is jealous that i have them

Makes my foot hurt Too many interior exposed parts rubbing against my foot

they look nice but they are pretty uncomfortable bulky and its not real leather and for its price it should be real leather but they do look nice

The style is simple and unassuming but catches the eye it is versatile and works on a number of levels including being a super cool sneaker to brag to your friends about plus only 80 bucks like common son let us go

I loved the shoes but they were a little to big just a mistake on my I guess

Design is minimalistic and can wear with pretty much any outfit

Stitching inside meant I sent them back otherwise shows looked really good

My son loved them Only annoying thing is there is a minimum for my review

Great sneakers for the price Very comfortable and clean looking

like alot up next truly only thing is on the off white ones the shoes sole and leather is not exactly the same color but its not that noticeable

Worth every penny and comfortable I love this shoe so much

Great shoe Looks good with the retro style I have been looking for something like these for a while Very happy with them

I love the cream colorway it is a different look that works well with anything

awesome shoes great off white color and pretty fast shipping

For the first month and a half After that the sole at the toe began to un stick from the leather

The shoes are very comfortable for its price I have been getting compliments all day about them I would definitely recommend these to anyone

I purchased the Continental 80s mainly they appeared similar to the Stan smith which is one of my go to but upon receiving my order the leather was a different texture from what I was expecting they appear more rugged and they also fit slightly larger from my other adidas sneakersnot quite a half size larger but not quite true to size either I do not know if I just got a bad pair but overall just was not what I was expecting The style is the best part though and they go with almost anything you wear Good spring summer sneaker

The shoe fits really nicely not like the narrow shoes that are popular right now Nice for people with wider feet These shoes are suprisingly big Bigger than the Adidas Superstars Also the leather comes pre wrinkled so just be aware of that

Basic with great style a good all purpose work out shoe

I enjoyed this product mainly because of the comfort and style of the sneaker A little discomfort but overall this shoe is great



Price right and quality great hoping they hold up

it is a throwback to the 80s of a shoe mixed with a high quality leather reaffirm it is classic style Simple clean great quality shoe and very very affordable

The sizing is 1 2 too big the fit is loose The quality is perfect nothing bad about the shoe

the side of the shoe was very painfultried wearing them around the house Just could not imagine a day in these shoes

Should have gotten a size smaller But love the look

Love the look and feel of the shoe but I wanted to wear the shoe with the laces loose and I ordered My normal size which is much to big to wear like that I will be returning for a half size smaller

Exactly what I was expecting Run a little bit large

Really good fit and extremely comfortable I would highly recommend these shoes

The only problem I have had so far was that the heel was not snug enough but I laced the shoe up higher and it made it better Still feels a little loose though However I do not plan to be running around in these shoes They are mostly for wearing around

Very classic shoes looking so good and comfortable

I like the design but the leather is cheap and wrinkles after a few wears fits large

I love these shoes I think that they are gorgeous I bought a white pair in my size and I even tried a size up and they are so tight on me width wise I have done everything possible to make them stretch and nothing works Is there no wide foot option for these

Shopping at the mall when I came across these beautifully designed 80s replica shoe They are simple but still will definitely get you compliments and the plus is their super comfortable They are a tiny bit narrow but not tothe point of discomfort or ruining the design of the shoe

The shoes fits perfect I like the vintage look of the shoes

Good product Similar to the yeezy calabasas Dope cheap alternative Provides good comfort Could have went 1 2 size smaller though for a snug fit

Disappointed My shoes I ordered were damaged The tag was was coming off the tongue I am very dissatisfied with you all adidas

The shoe itself looks really good and the tumbled leather feels and looks great My right foot is a little bit tighter than my left or else I would have given the shoe a perfect fit Overall I am happy with my purchase

I saw this sneak on the web and for some odd reason knew I would love it Afterwards I continued to look at pics of it waiting for it to arrive I do not usually buy sneakers unless I really need them

Some smaller manufacturing errors on the stitching and some frayed ends on the seams but nothing that would compromise the shoe it is really comfy and looks great

I loved the off white color first time trusting that and it was a safe bet Not too clean to worry about but enough to be taken seriously

it is very simple and clean sport show and yet posh and elegant

Love these shoes Looks on with everything Simple and stylish Classic

THESE ARE AWESOME COMFORTABLE AND THEY LOOK GOOD ON ME LOL

good product classic shoe thats comfortable

These will be replacing my Stan Smith Perfect for the summer and everyday shoes

Affordable Comfortable and Stylish it is a classic what is else to say

Super stylin you already knowwww

I would suggest the offwhite pair since you can get the black Calabasas for a little more

Love the simple design of the shoes fits great and comfortable to walk around it

Love the retro top ten powerphase combo look I hope Adidas try out some different colors

They are super comfortable and I lasted a whole day walking around the city with them

I am big on comfort and versatility These have both in abundance

The shoe is no doubt a nice style but the pair that I received came with ripped leather on the side as if someone forgot to take off the excess leather Also the pair must have been used before as the bottoms were brown would not be a big deal but it makes a difference in initial presentation especially with the white pair

Cool shoes very comfortable necessary shoe for your wardrobe

Very dissapointed I had to return them they look super big in the foot

comfortable everyday shoes nice for going out or walking around would not use for working out in

Quality leather and a lot more comfortable than I was expecting Shoe fits close to true to size for me slightly more room than a normal for my shoe size Not large enough to size down though Classic look for a great price point

Similar to reviews prior to mine the leather used on this shoe is abysmal Either it was rushed for production or purposely done to give it that aged look I expect more out of the Adidas brand

I like the look but was disappointed of of how Uncomfortable it is

I like this product because they have a retro look that you can pair with modern streetwear

Because they are swagged out The laces say swag The stitching says swag Etc

Great styleand fit Look great with dresses jeans or sweats

I love them they are white enough to look white from afar without getting as dirty as completely white sneakers

Love these shoes so much Plan to buy another pair for back to school

Adidas shoes always fit my feet perfectly I love the retro style and the sneak is very comfortable

They were nice And I liked them Your review text is too short

The arches are very high and go all the way across the middle

I love the overall design that take me to good old day when Continental 80introduced nevertheless I wish if the shoe was little bit more comfortable so that I could wear it everywhere even for a long walk on the street

They look great with almost any outfit I love how anyone can wear them I am getting them for my daughters and husband Definitely a very cool street style sneaker

super comfy out of the box i got the off white ones just wish they had a little more arch support other than really good shoe

It is a great shoe but it gets dirty easily and the grip of the soles is not that good

the looks are great but shoe is not comfortable the insole bunches up and the bottom of the tongue feels knotted causing pain on the top of my feet

Great quality of leather on the show but the insoles are not great at all

This shoes is exactly what I expected it to Super comfortable and great looking I am in love with it

They are comfortable but not to comfortable they are a little tight on the sides but it is cool you do not notice it when you are moving

I would have went a half size smaller but other than that they are comfortable the leathers is soft a little stronger in toe box

These are the white sneakers I have been looking for They go with everything and look amazing in any setting They are incredibly comfortable and they do not look bulky Absolutely love them

I have always loved adidas products they are all I wear

Very Comfortable would order another pair now I need socks for size 13

These shoes are awesome They remind me of the 90s and are a nice throwback pair I ordered the off white option

Classic looks comfort without too much bulk Looks cool

Great sneaker and very stylish it is very authentic and comfortable

Fits great Super comfy honestly did not expect them to be as comfortable as they are

I like the look of the retro sneaker Def a 80feel

Super comfortable and stylish a must have item True classic

Great quality and design Very comfortable goes with everything

Size 13 and they fit perfect and able to wear them all day and it is comfortable throughout the entire day

The shoe was made out of very poor quality leather that just folds and crumbles

Very comfortable I wear them to work everyday I have tried many brands but the Adidas are the best

ITS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WHAT YOU SEE IN THE IMAGE

Really good shoe I have to let it grow on me a bit but it has already started

amazing bring back to the 80vibes perfect timing

brings me back to the 80to my parents time amazing

Great sneakers they look great and very comfortable

These are awesome I have a lot of shoes but always resort to the same few pairs These are an instant addition to the every day rotation Very clean and minimal with a classic yet unique aesthetic

Great classic and comfortable shoe I would get it in every color

Must have shoe in rotation Classic look comfortable every day shoe quality

I love these kicks they fit perfectly very different approach and the quality is on point

Quality materials beautiful silhouette A true classic Only complaint is the lack of heel cushioning I usually only wear shoes with boost so it is really not a fair comparison

Love the creamy color of the shoe and how it looks Gives a summer vibe and it is great

I bought these shoes expecting something lesser in quality but was pleasantly surprised to find that the craftsmanship and materials were top notch

This sneaker is perfect for any summer wardrobe Looks great with any socks or no socks Cant wait to wear with pants as well

Very cool shoe and it looks really good on foot Perfect for summer My only qualm and I need to return for this reason is there is a broken stitch on bottom on the eyestay You can see a side by side in the picture I am returning and will definitely be getting another

I was so execited but was disappointed It is way too narrow

Love the style the fit and the comfort never fails

It is very comfortable though a little narrow but still the best casual I have seen and use in recent times and I have recommended it for some friends who have received their package in the last few days The best for light sport or casual so far Very lovely

The originals never go out of style They are probably the last of shoe style runs big had to go down a 1 2 size because the shoe is wide even with my wide foot

Normally I purchase the Swoosh brand I decided to step out of the box and try Adidas Man I am impressed They are affordable comfortable and stylish They go with everything Sweats jeans shorts does not matter I am about to start a new collection with just Superstars Best purchase I made in a long time

It is very comfortable though a little narrow but still the best casual I have seen and use in recent times and I have recommended it for some friends who has received their package in the last few days The best for light sport or casual so far Very lovely

I have been wearing adidas superstars for 13 years Adidas recently changed the design slightly They made the logo on the back of the shoe and on the tongue an awful gold color instead of the original white like the ones pictured here after visiting several stores and scouring the internet for a pair with the original white logos I found these i received them only to find they had the gold logo which is not what was pictured I recommend the picture be changed to show the exact product

I love a good pair of sneakers and these were the perfect addition to my bday attire They are comfy and fit well

When the shoes arrived I opened the shipping box which was intact Then i saw the adidas box It was ripped smashed and UN useable I took the shoes out and they were fine you guys need to take better care of customer orders Even though the price was discounted I still expect quality packaging

1st pair of shell toes bought them for the summer still have not worn them yet

They had a big piece of clear rubber on bottom of shoe and were very uncomfortable I returned them In the store none of them had a clear piece of rubber on bottom

I bought these for my nephew for Christmas and he just loves them he is all about his shoes now he is wanting a different color in them

Love these always did never had the superstars when I was younger I like these more

My son asked for these as a Christmas gift I made the order and they arrived in a couple days He loves them he is fresh and feeling himself he is not complaining about anything and neither am I

Wow so proud with my new superstar adidas from finish line the best online shoes sellers all brands As usual I like the service and the good quality of my product I will keep buying from finish line cause it is more secured than nowhere else

Absolutely an attractive shoe with edgy style and extreme comfort

Loved the shoes they were very comfortable and for a very reasonable price

You can never go wrong with the classic Perfect fit and very comfortable

Very comfortable Wear them all the time I am on my 2nd pair now

Goes with everything can not go wrong Regular fit Bought for school shoes

I like it it goes with everything it will never go out of fashion

I wore these back in college Glad to see they have made a come back I love the gold label You have to be sure to get the right size because the arch is weird Once you do they will fit you like a nice pair of gloves

i think they are over priced for a style this OLD

Won my first boy breakdance contest with them Awesome

Great style great fit Love these shoes Would recommend

These shoes are the only style that hold up to my sonflooring profession

Great build quality same great Superstars as always Loved these shoes in the 90s love them now

Get another pair I got a pair for all three of my boys They love the shoes

I really love the shoes I also bought a pair for my son just like my pair and he loves them also

Overall pleased with the looks of the shoes and comforthowever my left shoe frequently makes noise and my foot actually feels the damaged sole

My son asked for these particular shoes and he has truly enjoyed wearing them

Comfy for the work I do my feet do not hurt would buy again

Love these sneakers though I had to order some fat laces online as it seems that no one carries fat laces anymore

Nice looking People will start to copy your style

I am very happy with the comfort style and color of these shoes

Bought classic white with black stripes Quality has decreased over the years Not made with full leather upper anymore Leather only from first stripe to toes and around lace holes The rest of the shoe is a rigid man made material that does not breathe Overall looks good and has good arch support but wish they would return to the original high quality construction

Bought these Togo with my outfit for and80party I was going for the run dmc look aND the shell toe addias completed the look The black with withe stripes were perfect

And the shoes fit comfortable you could wear these shoes to sleep

MY GRANDSON LOVE THESE SHPES HE ONLY WANTED THE OLD ONES

My son saw these and just had to have them I was shocked because these are throwbacks from my time Was so happy to see they look just as good today as they did in the 80This really is a timeless sneaker

My shoes came with a few creases but they are very comfortable i love them

They are real hot kicks the problem was the way they first fit it is too loose inside and feel like they are going to come off when you are walking even though they are laced up good

order a half size smaller love these definitely getting more pair

Wear 10 5 in nike got these in 11 but verrrry tight hoping to exchange try it again

Love these Had them on for a couple of hours and received at least 20 compliments from strangers Definitely iconic Will purchase a new pair when these get dirty A Must have in my closet

Been buying them for years and will continue as long as Adidas keeps making them

I bought these shoes for my son because I love shell toes His feet are a little wide so they were a little uncomfortable for him at first I have never had a problem with mine After he wore them a few times they were better

Bought it as a gift for my boy he loved them Very true to size and comfortable not to mention stylish

If you have a wide foot and if your looking for a stylish and very comfortable shoe then this is a shoe for you You can never go wrong with a classic look

I purchased for my son as soon as he saw them he wanted them I felt like I hit the Jackpot because they were discounted He wears them with outfits once a week true to size it is a classic shoe You can not go wrong

they will never go out of style

Thank You Finish Line for a great product and a great deal After looking around online we located a pair of shoes on your website My son was estatic with his Adidas Classics and he didnt have to settle for a product he didnt want The price was reasonable it arrived sooner than expected and it was in stock unlike other online stores

I bought this shoe primarily for the look I was not disappointed as they go with countless outfits always looking clean and casual

Amazing product as always Get a 1 2 size smaller than usual

I gave this shoes as a gift for my husband and he loves it He is size 10 and it fits perfectly At first I got a size 9 1 2 because I read from some reviews to size down but it is tight on him so I have to exchange to size 10 and it fits perfectly

Comfortable shoes I like the look Easy to put on

The best Adidas ever made in my opinion You keep making them I will keep buying them

They look good They are a little too narrow Overall a good product

did not like the quality of the pair i received The logo on the tongue of the shoes had some missing print

Great pair of shoes They run bigger so be careful when ordering I am hoping they restock some other sizes so I can order more

Must have Classic superstar shoes Love my new shoes

Superstars are always a good standard and this color works well for the spring summer

Great and comfortable shoes I use it for everyday use and my feet stay relaxed all day

it is the style and color i wanted rare color set

I like the product because of timeless style Packaging and shipping methods were great I like the addition of second pair of shoelaces Will by again

i have always been a fan of shell toes and i needed a new pair

Great looking shoe Been wearing them for about 7 years now

Same color for men no green or red strips for decades Women have large selection of colors

Adidas has always made great comfortable and long lasting shoes I appreciate their work and the fact that they take pride in their shoes and clothing

The style that i I like nice shoes my friends they ask where I got it from a lot if compliments

Love these What more can I say about this iconic Adidas shoeThey rock

bc these shoes are trash not the best shoes to really go running when ur trippin

I am buying only this model for years and I wear only superstar model for years I wanted to buy 3 pcs with my custom design To bad you discontinued your desing your own service what I will now buy 2 black and 1 whiteToo bad

I am a college student so comfort is crucial in walking to class I get a bunch of compliments on these I got the all white pair and they look great with any outfit I am normally a size 7 in women but based on the reviews I ordered a 5 5 in men instead of a 5 like suggested They fit PERFECTLY I have pretty thin ankles that slipped out a lot at first but if you google how to are lace your shoes so your shoes fit better they are completely fine

Stylish and comfortable Love all my Adidas gear

This is the only shoe in the WORLD I can wear all day

Kareem Abdul Jabbar wore this sneaker during his Hall of Fame career

Loved them all got them for all the fam Now we could all take a comfortable walk and have a family date

These shoes are awesome please keep making the classics

Classic comfortable casual clean look well made goes with anything and i definitely purchase another pair again

I will always have a pair of these on hand Easy to wear go with everything True classics and they are comfortable Also look good with shorts or jeans

Great fit great fit great fit great fit very stylish

I have a foot injury metatarsalgia and these are the first shoes in MONTHS where the ball of my foot does not feel like it is on fire Also a tattoo artist told me these shoes are dope while I was waiting for my appointment the other day So that was awesome

Sturdy easy to break in fashionable Reminds me of being a kid

I have always been a fan of Adidas and i needed a pair of all white shell toes

The shoe slips off my heels The heel is too wide The laces do not help hold the shoe on

Clean and casual shoe that is perfect for a chill outfit

I like the look of this shoe Very stylish reminds me of old school Run DMC

So cool exactly what I expected the description says orange but they look more red which is fine I wanted more of a red color anyway

Love the all star original brands shoes They fit great and look perfect

Goes with outfits well and there is just so much adidas can offer

I purchased 2 pairs for my boyfriend He wears a 14 so it can be a DREAD finding shoes but these were FANTASTIC and exactly what he wanted They are simple but have greats colors and detail to throw a little sauce in the creativity of the shoe They look great and fit great

Great shoe very durable but for some reason can not get a black with red stripes or red with black stripes I used to get through custom but they got rid of that option

Love the product wish it was easier to find They did not have a women version of the shoe so I had to adjust size to fit into a men

got the shoes i always wanted still in style now not sold out this time

Great color and design

Normally I love these shoes This time my right shoe seems to have had a manufacturing mistake as it looks like the seams are not sewn on properly for the right shoe

These are so cute Received a bunch of compliments

Well made shoe He loves it it is hIs second pair

I would love these if they were a little smaller Your conversion chart is incorrect online I ordered a 10 in men because the chart said that is the same as a women 11 That is not true I would return these for a size 9 but I wore them outside so I feel that is dishonest to return them now Is there anything I can do

I love superstar The best shoes I have ever had

What am I going to add here

I have been a fan of superstars for years i used to always get them ever since i was in 2nd grade every year for school but apparently at some point you guys added superstar to the side of the shoe i do not need my friggin shoes to say superstar on the side please make an option where there is no text on the side of the shoes

Needed a new white pair of shoes to go with any outfit and picked up a pair of Adidas Superstar shoes I get compliments on these shoes everywhere I go and I am a very satisfied customer

Because is very sport style and nice shoes dress and nice to use for everything

I used to have these a while back and decided to buy them again and the material and looks of the shoe are identical to how I remembered them Aka love them

These shoes are classics plain and simple They are one of the most versatile and comfotable shoes you can buy

The product is comfortable and can wear with almost anything

Perfect product good size good quality and really nice color

Adidas is my favorite shoe very comfortable for the style

I do happy I shop online or I would have missed this shoe at an awesome price

These shoes always last long and take a beating From working 12 hr shifts to 4 hr concerts they are a solid made product and always a go to for me

They are perfect I can not wait to order more They fit perfectly and wear great

Love the shoes stylish and timeless look also comfortable compared to the older versions

They are good quality and very comfortable Very happy customer thank you

Love these classic shell toes got two compliments from strangers the first day I wore them

Too narrow size is nice but they hurt a little on the sides

Always been a fan since i was a youth bringing it back to the old school

He really wanted to love them ordered a size 13 according to their chart but the shoe was too narrow and slightly short Returning for a larger size hope that helps

I love these shoes I have 2 pairs of 3 stripes black and all white and I have worn a pair since I was 16 there is no arguing with classic Classic for comfort Classic for style Classic for cool it is my brand and my statement

Why not add ultraboost Super comfy classic but would love to see how it would be with a boost sole 

Little bit more width at the ball of the foot not entire toe box and more stability in the arch

Love the classic look of the Superstars They are very comfortable right out of the box I have wide feet so these were a bit narrow in my normal size but I ordered a half size up and they are fine

I love them they are sturdy gooooddd quality only this is I wish I would have gotten them half a size smaller but that was my fault but they are legit

Daughter loves the shoe and personalization brought them over the top

The superstar is my favorite shoe and I like the way it looks in all black

This shoe is comfortable and stylish I am not a real sneaker wearer but these really caught my eye

I wore this shoe when I was a kid Loved them then still love them now

ADIDAS has always been a quality product In my opinion

I have always had and worn Adidas shoes because the the styles and comfort of the product

My name is on them and that is why I like them I usually wear a 7 however something told me to get a half size smaller and they fit perfectly

They look super stylish however after four hours on my feet my feet were crying

My feet are really wide and it makes it hard to find comfortable sneakers These fit me pretty great

Great pair of shoes very comfortable foam cushioning The color on the stripes is a little bit different than pictured though

Great looks Comfortable Love the style Awesome

classic kicks style and comfort all in one shoe

Size was spot on Son loves these 111111111111111

Material is cheap quality the shoes make a squishing noise below average quality

 LifeOfBoris

The shoe is a classic and must have in the shoe collection The quality is amazing in the sneaker But it does run long In my opinion you should size down half a size Also it is a narrow sneaker so not good for wide feet

I love my pants and shoes I ordered everything fits perfectly

Great fit affordable comfortable color matched exactly

Great design comfort size width and quality as you would expect

I love customized shoes and that is only surpassed by the love I have for A would I would AThank you

Handsome shoes they are very comfortable and fair price

I bought the sneakers for my son he loves them He is paralyzed and the sneakers helped is well being I have been trying to get for me 11 1 2 wide but so far no luck great sneakers for him and I would recommend them to anyone

Classic shoes they go with everything and the feel is great

it is the perfect classic shoe that goes with everything

Great shoes once they are broken in First week was a little uncomfortable but it gets better

I love this product because the shoes look good and feel very comfortable They look and give you that retro feel and are very affordable Totally worth it

Classic Exactly what I used to wear as a kid Fits great and definately has the classic addidas look I will buy another pair soon

Superstars wear like iron and last longer than my feet

White on White Funky Fresh Legendary Classic son

They are roomy so def size down at least a half size

This show is a classic I bought these for my wife and she wears them all the time The laces are a bit long so the loops look a little weird but she still loves them

My favorite shoes Always get them will recommend them

it is a classic you can never go wrong it is simple and goes with everything

A little big for me but because it is the first time for me to buy Adidas shoes I think it is enough

the product is fit for purpose thats my high level summary

Shoes sole not white like before it is light gray now whyThis is a classic you can not change it without letting us know a classic is a classic SMH

A little disappointed in the creases near the toebox of the shoe after a week of wearing them

My friend like the superstar shoes very much but the size is a little bit large he usually wear size 7 and I should choose the 6 5 for him instead of 7

They are tried and tested very classic staple High quality construction but do not expect the same level of comfort as a sneaker from the 2010 These are very comfortable for a shoe that is almost 50 years old Excellent option for people with us shoe size 14

I like it cause I bought it fora friend He was very happy

Excellent purchase Classic shoes that fit great

Great pair of shoes Such an iconic silohuette Very happy with my purchase

I love love love the allstars but have a wide foot

I like the product because it is a very stylish sneaker Since the color is versatile with most colors it pairs perfectly with most outfits Especially when trying to dress down an outfit but still keeping it classy in a way it is perfect for that I definitely would recommend to friends and family

It was a gift and he absolutely loves them He said they are very comfortable

My family has been wearing this particular style for over 30 years and we have no complaints about this style at all

The only thing about the new release of shell toes is the big gold logo I had to go with the blackouts although I love the way they look wish they offered the white with black stripes without the huge goddy gold logo

I like the shoe because of how comfortable and stylish it is It is perfect for my work

Always get what you expect in the particular product

I love these shoes Classic looks great so stylish

I love these shoes because they are different from the type of shoes I usually get and they fit perfectly

My son loves these shoes so I ordered him a new pair for Christmas He was very happy

Shoes are a perfect fit and go well with my Jeans

Love the superstar design shoes this is my 9th pair i wanted the all black with with white strpes to no have to worry about dirt that much

They fit great and look awesome Great quality Love the black

Good looking shoes and are comfortable enough for most situations

I love these shoes Classic adidas design and very comfortable for everyday wear

Poor quality lettering the letters are falling off after less than 2 weeks

it is really good comfy to wear them every day I am always buying them

Great classic shoe Have had a couple pairs in the past but never grow tired of this look

Order 1 smaller than your actual shoes size Run about a size too big

Love the shoes only wished that you would get white shoelaces also

I like it cause I feel comfortable when I wear it

I bought this pair of shoes for my husband for Christmas and he loves them

It is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Bought these for my son He absolutely loves them Says they are very comfortable and stylish

One of my favorites cant go wrong with one of these the look is definitely there and the comfort of these shoe has never change its take a little breaking in but its all worth it These shoes go with everything you can wear them withshirt or dress shirts and they gets that double take look from others

Very good shoes and cute I love it I buy 2 pairs for me and my boyfriend we both in like how they feel you can walk with them nicely

They are a nice shoes with a great style you can use them all day long and feel great

Well worth the price Bought for a gift he was pleased with the purchase

Bought as a Christmas gift my son swears by these shoes

His favorite shoes so they are always well received

Nice style and perfect comfort with nice price very recommend

The size 14 fit great to me The product leather is confortable and the Quality it is great

are not nothing like the Classic Adidas Superstar Shoes

Lost my last pair and I did not hesitate to replace them right away

Just simply iconic and pure adidas This is a fantastic casual shoe that goes with everything

I love the classic look The hard top makes it look nice and easy to clean

My boyfriend like the gold accent with the black

I enjoy the look and quality of the shoe I look forward to my next pair

Great product and look for the money this is my 4th pair and will not be the last

Liked all of quality fit and comfort Great purchase

They are a nice looking shoe and good quality I am glad I purchased them

Adidas superstar will always be my favorite and now my bf favorite he loves them

These shoes look great with just about every casual outfit Very comfortable to wear all day

I love the product because it is reasonable in price and the quality is Amazing I Love these Shoes

Superstars go with any outfit They are my everyday go to shoe

I get these for my grandpa who likes to play racquetball These are the only shoes he wears and he thinks they are very comfortable 

Love this shoes Color is sharp and fits perfectly

Cause it matches my outfits and this white on white are hard to find at a local store

Because it is comfortable it is up to date in fashion price is affordable

very comfy and affordable i would definitely recommend to others

These things run big but as soon as you get the right size you all realize how much you love them

I love these shoes but my only problem is that the shoe is already coming apart from the shell which is upsetting I have only owned them for a year and rarely wear them They are very comfortable though I wear a 7 but bought a 6 5 and they fit perfectly

My boyfriend will only wear this style So I buy him a pair every year lol he loves them and they hold up nicely Always satisfied

it is not a bad shoes I have to give it recommend but hope the back side will be less hard

Timeless in nature these sneaks go with anything are extremely comfortable and a fashion statement in itself

good look classic it also has a appropriate price I love it

Adidas never disappoints me always great quality

My niece had trouble finding a right fit because of her wide foot This classic style was a great choice to go with She loved them

My whole family had this color The quality was good

Will most likely return because I do not like the style The toe and mid sole area is more like a grey ish off white color Despite the description saying Cloud White The Superstar shoes are made in different countries so the styles are hit and miss but all sold under the same product code

I have been purchasing Super Stars for almost twenty years I was happy to see this pair if full leather I have had Super Stars in the past where the back section is plastic and only the front of the shoe is leather Very happy to see the whole shoe is leather

Very comfortable and stylish every day wear Highly recommend these Superstars

Stylish comfortable Easy to wear black goes with every thing

Good quality and love the way I was able to customize them with my name

Go true to size and you will be good can not go wrong with classics

I purchase these for myself and my son My son has never worn a pair out He always out grows them Great shoes Very durable

Shoes were in perfect condition really comfortable

Just got these today and they are wrinkled on the sides

I love this shoe I just wish it was made of synthetic leather

I was hoping the color would be more of a mint green but it is actually a bit darker

They are the only shoe that is comfortable for me right out of the box

it is comfortable it is classic and can be woren with almost anything

My Adidas absolutely dope switch the dull laces for some with a pop done deal

Love these shoes The colors are cool and they are very comfortable

Comfortable great look stylish and everywhere I go I know I have the best pair of shoes

These shoes seem very durable and comfortable and I have already received compliments Just know that they can be warm for the summer so they are better for cooler weather

it is classic and I grew up in Argentina with this brand

I ordered the item but the tongue was insideout the toething fell off and the laces were the wrong color Based on all the positive reviews I assume this was a mistake and I was just unlucky enough to get the mistake

I chose this as a gift for my little bro He said the leather is amazing and really likes the shoes

Looks good in family pictures when we all wearing the same shoes

Exactly what I wanted for a present for mu son It was on his Xmas list

The upper was not full grain leather and was very stiff Not very comfortable I opted for a different Superstar Original that was leather upper and lining

I like them because they have a perfect balance between comfort beauty and quality

I love me some adidas classics With the new upgrade in comfort I will never move on from the adidas superstar

These superstars look and feel great As other mentioned the stripes are rather orange and not red as it may seem in some pictures However the black white and orange combination is very cool The materials and finishes have a high quality appeal In my case it does not deserve a five star rating because the quality control could have been better The left shoe has two black stains on two stripes

I like them quality comfort style design you can not ask for much more

Very nice I like it so much Fast shipping Quality is really good

I like the old school look but some little discomfort around the over the top of the toes but no biggy

Yes a great classic shoe well worth the money

I have this one for a long time and its quality and comfort are very durable also they look pretty well and it is one of the most iconic one on the market since ever

I was worried the color was going to be too shiny I could not really tell from the pictures But it was a nice matte color which make the shoes stick out while not being too obnoxious

It felt more comfortable and the color is not common it let me felt better

I am a big fan of shell toes but I was not aware that these particular shoes have a thicker padded tongue unlike other versions with a thinner leather style Great shoes but not what I was expecting My fault for now paying closer attention to online photos

Just like throw backs Make you feel youthful Time waits for no one

Been buying the same shoes since I was in high school Adidas is the best Got it all

Awesome classic shoes will surely turn some heads

Bought these for my wife because she wanted a matron or burgundy shoes We are an adidas family so this works My wife is used to boost so not as comfortable but she loves the color and the classic style

Clean ostrich print leather that does not crease up so I am happy with these

Looks cool can put it on anything Sweat pants jeans suit and tie

Receive a lot of compliments when I am wearing these cool kicks

I love adidas superstar and this one has good color combination

It silly what they are asking

Everythingwas except for the color

it is cool Pretty comfortable However too expensive

I was looking for comfortable solid black shell toe And as always Adidas is exactly what I wanted

my woman size is 6 and ordered this in 5 man size Fits me perfectly

I love the Superstar and when you had them in a size 15 I bought as many as I could Now you only have white and black How insulting

Some things will never go out of style like a pair of Wayfarers or denim jacket Superstar shoes are just as iconic and are rockable for ev er

New to me love these kicks Great price as well thanks

They where great perfect everything Great color a

I normally wear a size 8 but I ordered a 7 after reading other reviews and they were still too big I returned them with no issue and ordered a 6 5 instead and they fit great they are very stylish and comfortable once I got the right size

Grate adidas superstar shoes feel good look grate too

Because the look legit And i saw them from my cousin so i motivated myself on getting them

I like it cause this product is very good and it fits me this product is my favorite shoes

Honestly a great investment They are a bit snug on my feet and they pair well with all of my outfits Would definitely purchase again

I really like the quality and the conform Looks great with my shorts

I like this shoe and recommend it because of its comfort and style

It was very nice and comfy perfect fit the price was affordable

You have 5 stars

I am a female that has been searching for the perfect adidas sneakers The teal was perfect The white is crisp I was purchasing these in black and red but saw these as well so I bought both Thx Adidas They also arrived quickly Kudos to you

Looks great but not really comfortable as a walking shoes

My second pair of superstars and will not be my last quality is beyond great

Have always loved Superstars this Green is so awesome totally recommend them

Comfortable stylish classic and has not hi to do with Kanye west

Great shoe comfortable usually wear 11 5 11s and 10 5 fit comfortably took the 11s tho

i bought half a size smaller after going through the reviews Now i am regretting it So do not worry about the reviews and just buy your actual size

Not my first pair of Superstars probably will not be my last I like the color because it is not too popular I had Stan Smiths before and could not help but feel a little basic Very painful to break in though

I love these shoes They are classic and super comfy

this shoe is so comfterble and you can wear it with beasacli enything

Love superstars The original High quality A

These were to replace an outgrown pair of same style My 13 yr old HAS to have THIS style So for whatever reason his dad got a pair of Superstars from Amazon and were way too narrow tight and returned them I ordered from here and voila perfect Lesson learned 

Would of been helpful to know they run big Otherwise my daughter loves them Quality of the shoe is very nice

In the specifications it says the the lining is leather but it is fabric or some kind of synthetic

I was always a fan of the Adidas Superstar they are a classic

I bought them but they looked to bulky on me could not pull off a look with them

Runs true to size very comfortable There old school but still a great shoe

Super comfy and great quality I wear a 8 but bought a 7 Just slightly big but did not feel a neee to exchange smaller

Nice throwback look The mix of orange and black white clam toe ROCKS

Only thing was not sure about was solid blue adidas emblem on back of shoe Prefer the white whit blue lettering but am over it shoes are super cool

First pair of shoes out of the last 4 other brands that I have been able to wear all day that did not give me blisters I will definitely buy again

Just what I wanted superstars all black red stripes

I guess they are just made badly Pretty sure I will not but these again

The Navy coloring is nice as it is different from the black stripes everyone has but I was hoping the Adidas sign on the heel tab and the tongue were in white so you could actually see it from afar

Love the color combination

I like this product because for the last 10 years this is all I ever wore I usually order from Eastbay or Adidas

Old school that is what is up people do not have a clue whatsoever about history

Love the color and styling of these shoes Very comfortable and highly recommend them

Comfortable affordable and stykish everyone loves them I am a size 13 but I got a 12 5 and they fit me A okay happy that I was able to get these

Nothing cleaner then rocking a fresh pair of adidas especially with the personalization

The Adidas Superstars are versatile shoes that go with basically any outfit it is a clean and simple silhouette that compliments most style of dress The shoes are very easy to maintain too But also age preety well in my opinion

The stripes were suppose to be Red but they were more of a orange

Slightly narrow and anyone buying should definitely consider going half a size down Otherwise great shoes

Highly recommend actually ordered another pair for my nephew as a gift

Nice Style Comfortable and Good Quality The navy color looks really great

I work in an automotive warehouse and all the floors are concrete So I told myself I need a good confortable shoe Well I grew up watching the original footloose movie and I saw those shell toes and I wanted a pair ever since So march of 2017 I went on the hunt I was set on buying a pair of white and scarlet shell toes I had found them by the grace of god I guess last pair of that description in size 10 upon wearing them i put some Dr scholls inserts and it only made my feet hurt I was surprised of how well the sole was made So i wore out my pair of generic Nikes and they threw in the towel It was the time for my adidas to shine These shoes are well made I have had battery acid spill on them I have pulled 50 bags of oil dry that estimate about 1k lbs on a pallet That same night I would go to places in those same shoes and people would stop and stare at my adidas Those were some of the only ones in that description white scarlet around my area people that know me know me for those shoes if I am not wearing my cowboy boots These shoes are just for me

Shoes look great extremely good quality Only complaint is that compared to Boosts these shoes do not breath Not an all day shoe If you are going out for dinner you will look great If you are going out for the night tho grab your Boosts or something that breaths better

it is COMFORTABLE AND IT GOES WITH EVERYTHING nice pair of shoes

I love the sneaker and add it to the rest of my collection of superstars which is almost 200 So yes I love them

Great classic sneaker I would recommend it to anyone

Model is great comfort and very nice you can wear combine with everything

The colors look amazing the materials are top notch as expected and they are quite comfortable not too rigid nor too light

My old ones were a little to rusty so I just bought another so I was satisfied

This has always been my go to shoe it goes with everything and is very comfortable

The body of the shoe is too built up stiff cushioned and looks like a different adidas type of shoe up against the covered white toemakes the whole look dated

I am a woman who buys sneakers from the guys section because they have a cooler variety in my opinion I have never bought a pair of all white sneakers before but I finally decided to buy a pair I love these shoes They are stylish and comfortable and they go with every outfit Highly recommend Thank you Adidas

I like the color combination and good fit for a narrow foot

Fit fit and fit Too many shoe sneaker makers seem to assume all their customers are teenagers Adidas are built right Arch support Stiching that holds together The Superstar shoes are your best choice in the world for one shoe that comes closest to doing it all Find your color or customize it

Very good purchase Fits perfectly and very comfortable

Best purchase I ever made Very comfortable sizing chart was very helpful

I have always loved the originals I am excited to see these shoes continue to be the a go to style

Classic styling a bit loose around the ankle price is good more colors available would be nice

Very comfortable love the color scheme perfect fit

It seems like every time I think of a color combination or look of a shoe adidas is right there in my head pulling out my idea making it into a shoe so that I can buy them and wear them like I mean it Thank you

Always had a thing for the fly shell toe Adidas sneaker They are comfortable and they are very versatile

This is my third pair of this shoe I love them They are perfect for the Pacific Northwest With the rubber toe my feet stay dry in the wet weather and they do not get scuffed

They look just like their photo and are super comfortable

I literally wore these shoes everyday yes everyday for the past year I did this because I lived in China for a whole year and the streets there are hard on your feet any other shoe I would try would leave my feet hurting at the end of the day or even before This were the only kicks that were able to hold up even when it rained I did not get any water inside unless I stepped on a massive puddle I skate on them walk miles and miles a day and they hold on pretty good I am buying my second pair today because now I can not find shoes that are as comfortable as this

I received these shoes for a birthday present from my wife I was looking for the throwback look that come in spades with this shoe I read a few reviews saying to go up a size because they were too narrow but while they were a little snug in the width I found them to be quite comfortable and they do relax with regular wear

I liked the colors and the strings also the ties

The shoes came in a box that looked as if it was thrown around a couple of times This was the actual shoebox not the box it was shipped in When I went to try them on I noticed that one of the shoe laces were already untied and laced up to the top holes which meant someone else had already tried on the shoes The insoles feel cheap and I got blisters on my arches after a day of walking because the insoles are not flush with the inside of the shoe Overall a bad experience

I would of loved to get a exchange for these shoes since there big by a size Feelsl like flip flop

These shoes are awesome and one of my favorites I have a few There needs to be a wide version of these available though Please make this happen and put me on a waiting list for them

Very comfortable and look great they are my new favorite shoe

The shelltoe has been my favorite sneaker since i was a kid

Large sizes are hard to find Classic amazing look

perfect fit color perfect best shoe purchased till date

Great quality of the product good length and width and the shipping or returns is really fast and easy and will buy again

Great colors comfortable and fashionable great for work

The shoe and color was outstanding would love to have different colors Please

I think these Adidas shoes are beyond amazing They  look and feel good and they are very comfortable I recommend these to anyone

I wear these practically everyday and it is so easy to style these with any kind of outfitwhether it is casual street or straight up lazy comfy I am actually thinking about buying another pair of the same colorway because I wore these so often

good to know if I customize and require a correction it is a no go

Good looking shoe Good fit and versatile for a lot of different looks Only issue is that the included laces are super long

Superstar OGare very narrow like a or width I have several pair of the Superstar RTand they are a would width and super comfy Had to return the OG 

Very Cool Shoes with Great Style Happy with my Birthday gift

product is good as expected however the width of shoe is narrow even after ordering a 1 2 size larger

High quality Product Well put together Stick with your True ways Just be open to more Colors with your Original stuff

I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for something clean and classic to pull a summer outfit together

This was a father Day gift for my husband He wears a size 14 so I was happy that I could find that size online and that when they came through the mail they fit true to size

It is good shoes Not easy to maintain in my opinion

This shoe is very comfortable I would definitely recommend this shoe The size runs a little big I ordered a 1 2 size smaller than I normally wear and it fits great

My kid brought these for himself for his birthday I am glad he can appreciate a classic shoe 4xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8fs

I love these shoes and do not even want to wear them much because I am afraid to make them dirty The few times I have worn them they are comfortable and perfect

Classic Super comfortable and durable love the color choices i had to get the blues aswell

A comfortable basic sneaker No frills no hypejust a utilitarian shoe No need to worry about the latest styles and colorsthis functional shoe fits my needs and looks good as well Thanks Adidas

Came in very quickly even doing the personalization Was a gift for my father and he loves them

I have always had trouble finding shoes that fit Saying that the shoes are pretty comfortable I did put a different in Solon that help support my arch After that they were much more comfortable I am still breaking them in the expect him to feel even better

It was really nice and comfortable It is amazing and I love the shoes

I like the product because I have been in love with those shoes the day they came out I have always wanted to get a pair and I finally got it

I have been looking for these shoes for a year I wish they made them in women But it worked out and I am happy and in love

Put 9 5 on was too long try size 9 length was OK but very tight on width

it is not what I had thought it would be it is not a very good quality shoe I normally order under armour I wanted the name on the side of the shoe to be red and it came to me white

I like the style of the product could be made more comfortable

Really love the color scheme They are stylish and comfortable

I have always been Adidas fan and I find there shoes really comfortable and stylish They always come up with new colors and style

My Super star are perfect for what I want because 1 they are Adidas 2 they are comfortable 3 Reliable until the end and lastly they have that old school classic look

The classic superstar blacked out These things are ninjas if you dig the old school feel Can wear with anything anywhere and of course at any time

Fan of the shoes Fan of the three stripes Good quality it is perfect I would like to see more different colors Other then that perfect

True to size Exactly as expected A classic Highly recommend

Nice looking for sure can not wait to wear them out

I have always liked this style and it was nice to find them more or less the same as I remember with the rubber shell toe sole pattern and identification Subtle and not overdone yet people who know quality shoes see them for what they are a great shoe and will comment Truly amazing to be able to buy them directly from Adidas on line without shopping forever I appreciate the shoes and the shopping experience My advice to AdidasHelp us tall guys with big feet out and offer some extended options in size 14 

Super uncomfortable I ordered three pairs all different size Go for the samba they are much better

I love the brand I like that Adidas mix tradition with modern style It is a perfect blend

I like them and got lots of compliments the first time I wore them They are classics The only thing I noticed is since they are so flat standing in them for along time and the bottom of my feet were sore But I love them

Cool colors very comfortable and stylish Ordering the other cool colors

A shoe that has stayed true since my childhood I love these classic shoes

I did not like the product necause it was to big Wide and its was for mens and not womens but i liked the quality

It did not fit Quality is excellent it just do not fit

Superstars have been my go to shoes for years The monogram is a bonus

Great shoes I love the comfort and style of these shoes

Great shoes have always got these shoes since i was a kids and they still rock today

I love it it is the most comfortable you can get and it is pretty nice

Love the look my all time favorite but molding quality stitching quality should be a priority for every single pair of superstars

It has good comfort a great look a great fashion and a great color

Excellent but too small in my current size 10 and they doesnt have half size to try

Nice shoes just as expected Good quality and very comfortable

it is super comfy I would buy these again

Adidas shell tops are my favorite sneaks great fit

Because you do not make women shoes above size 10 I bought menshoes But men and womenfeet are not the same So after buying menshoes I realized after a couple a weekof wearing them they are not as comfortable as women 

Fits good and goes with pretty much any outfit I have

Very comfortable once and forever a classic This is my third pair of Superstarsthe others are showing wear and tear from frequent use and I decided to buy a new pair and keep these for good I do not know anyone can go wrong with leather Superstars

I have not worn superstars since I was in high school They are more comfy then I remember My son and I love our new adidas apparel We will definitely be back in the near future

I had some of these growing up and bought myself some now as an adult Absolutely love them1

I love the overall aestethic and the way it feels on my feet

Had to have all blacks for work Gambled buying online They are the most comfortable pair of shoes I have now

I have a relatively narrow foot for a guy and this shoe was very narrow for even me

Shelltoe classic Adidas Superstar are very comfortable

Short time of delivery

Very nicely made and look good on match with any clothing item

I like the Superstars Very trendy I was kind of a bandwagon but there is a reason why people buy the Superstars

Coolest shoes on the planet Addidas Superstar series

design is nice and I would recommend getting half size smaller

The old school style makes you feel like a superstar

I got really wide feet but fora normal person they are rad

Hard to go wrong with the superstar Usually a good quality leather upper for a reasonable price I do think the superstar 2 used to offer superior cushioning and padding

Like it its very comfortbalel have choose 4 shoes Every one and every color is very beautiful

These have been good looking shoes for a long time

The adidas Superstars are one classic shoe They fit perfectly in my collection and will hopefully look as good as they do now in the summer However I had to go a full size and a half up for them to fit properly since they are really narrow My true size is a size 8 but I usually go for an 8 1 2 for extra comfort but I had to get these in a size 9 1 2 for them to fit properly and comfortable Other than that I am pretty satisfied with my purchase

This shoe is perfect for my narrow feet and is true to size Male 10 5 with narrow feet

I like them because I had them back in the day I wanted to bring the old school back These are what I liked back then but wish I got the high tops

it is a very comfortable shoe you can not go wrong with the Shelltoe Adidas

nice and confortable shoes also very good look

I generally wear womensize 8 or 8 5 shoes and per all the advise here I went down to a 6 5 and it is perfect I have never had a pair of shoes more comfortable ever I have walked in them over 250k miles and they are still going strong

it is quality made but the toe are is very narrow

Superstars have been around for about 5 decades After my purchase it is clear to see why they are are still around and the most popular choice for everyone collection Put an adidas outfit together and posted on my Instagram Share your thoughtsgrid style99

super classic go with anything i wear they are my day in day out go to shoe love

Love the shoe love the shoe love the shoe love the shoe

I really like them fit perfectly look nice your mom loves them

For the price the quality of the shoes is worth it 

I like them cause now I have both the black and white pairs of Superstars

I been buying addidas since high school years Love

I got it as a gift for my brother and he loves it It came on time

I like the looks of the shoe and wear it as a casual shoe I would not wanna train in it

it is perfect I am glad I bought it It look so sick

Product was a comfortable fit at a nice price Great for shuffling at the festivals for this summer Easy to wipe off spilled beer on them to

I purchase the superstar in 1999 and it was an outstanding shoe The width of the shoe at the ball of the foot was wider the lining inside the leather was thicker and the foot pad had more cushion I purchased this product to replace the 1999 version but it is just not as well made I have are glued the sole to the upper shoe several times and they are still in use Size 14 is not available in stores so it is not easy to try on shoes to check fit and feel

Reading the reviews most people were saying to get a size down from your normal size Based on that and the Adidas fitting guide I bought an 8 They were too small so I returned them I repurchased in my usual size 9 and that was perfect I have only worn them once but I think I am going to really like them

Perfect size came on time in perfect shape I loved it

Great look with shorts jeans etc Going to wear them a lot

I love the shoes they are a size small I would like a size 5 instead of a size 4 1 5

Kind of a retro look which is what I love Kind of old school muscle car

The delivery was fast the shoes made it in 3 days One of the shows had sum glue on the shell toe but I was able to clean it off overall I would order again

Always great products and sizes for big and tall men

Super comfortable I get compliments every where I go

I think these shoes will break in and be super comfortable but I wish ADIDAS offered EE sizes AMERICANS likely your largest customer base have big feet

They very likeable shoes fills so great to wear love them so well

The product is amazing due to its simplistic design I like to wear a pair of shoes that can match with any casual outfit These shoes fulfill that common want among many consumers they are fairly comfortable and are easy to clean Do not worry yourself over the probable factors which contribute to the dirtying of a shoe Just get a d and rag and wipe any dirt or debris off it is just that simple This product a cost effective purchase without compromising the overall comfort or physical appearance of the product itself A true win win for both the consumer and producer is how I would describe these shoes after several instances of use Thank you Adidas you continue to impressand for that I sincerely thank you

One of the best hands down God bless you all keep up the good work

I have worn Superstars since I was a teenager they are my favorite everyday sneakers

All my brothers love this OG I bought them this style to be Team Adidas 

These are hands down the best pair of shoes out there

I am pleased that the all black option was available for purchase I have not purchased a pair of Adidas in decades so I purchased the men xc5 x9b size 7 5 rather than the women xc5 x9b 9 5 becasue I hoped they would be wide I am pleased that they are wide enough for me They came poorly packaged with torn paper wrapping and a crushed box

The shoes are very comfortable amd they match with all the cloth

They run a little bigger than I expected but it is a great shoe

Very disappointed to find out the shoes are made with real leather Love the style but the realization made my heart sink I should have researched first but unfortunately I will have to return them

Cal fans must overlook the burgundy piping USC colors

Looks good and fits well I recommend this shoe to anyone

Look sharp and I have received lots of compliments

I purchased this last 12 26 17 and been handling it with care as it is my 1st Adidas pair I have always been a Converse person Apparently after just 2 months the threads are starting to loosen and come off in front of the shoes Hoping to hear from you

Bought for my son he loves them Been buying these since he was younger and now he is 35 and still loves them

this is the best shoes ever 2nd pair of it my friend wanted and i will give it to him

I ordered a pair for my granddaughter fit perfect I ordered a men equivalent to womens size for me Was uncomfotable so gave them to my niece Fit her I ordered another pair 1 2 size bigger Fit ok I am going to order a black pair

I love my superstars this is the 4th pair I am getting and they are all perfect

So comfortable

Classic Run DMC I have wanted another pair of these since I was in my 20 

The shoes are very good and beautiful and last a long time and the shipping is fast

it is very cool looking and very comfortable Best fashion shoe I have

My husband was looking for that adidas and I was able to find it and get it in a timely manner

I had a pair in high school 1975 I always wanted another pair and finally got them thank you

They look plastic Not really quality and they feel like wearing plastic I was hoping they would be stylish but they have this weird boot like plastic mold on the front that makes them look tacky

The shoe did not fit or feel good It did not move with my foot at all Kind of felt like a giant rubber sandal

my son loves them says they are comfortable and cool

Classic from the early days made in West Germany

I love it i bought it for internet and Im aleays wanted So now im so happy thank God and you

Great comfy relaxing super coolest xxxxxawesome co

I like that the shoes fits but its to flat on the bottom its not meant for the snow but i like how its fits well on my feet i wish to put my name on it but your website will not let me

This shoe goes with a lot of my daily outfits The style is perfect to wear with my joggers and jeans I highly recommend them

Not sure because the sizes are drastically different

I am an all black shoes guy My favorite color is black

it is a great purchase plus I got it at a great price

They look great with jeans or slacks I have 3 pair When a pair gets worn in appearance they become work shoes and i buy a new pair going dressing up

High quality and good fit Great for walking tennis or basketball

First pair of Adidas I would totally buy another pair

I have been buying these shoes for a couple of decades At first they were just my racquetball shoes but have long since become the only shoes I wear

They are my favorite casual wear shoe They are super comfy and stylish

Classic Adidas style with amazing fit and quality These are my go to for casual and contemporary shoe wear they stand the test of time in fashion Pair with some different color laces and step up your shoe game

I order these for my boyfriend for Christmas and got them personalized and they turned out perfect Only issue I have now is that I am wanting to order another pair and get them personalized but it will not let me do itWhy

Purchased for son for Christmas and he loved them

I have had these shoes for 3 months and they are holding up really good Especially compared to the cheap shoes I used to buy before these Those shoes usually started to fall apart in 2 or 3 months but these no They are just slightly worn out with a few parts creased and they are a little bit dirty and that is about it They are good for the gym but even better for casual streetwear and school and they are versatile as well they are comfortable but I think they might be slightly big but that is not the shoes fault I just did not find my size 11 so I got 11 5 instead but it is close enough for me to not really care But if you want something that looks good with many outfits and that will not just fall apart really quick then I highly recommend the Adidas Superstars

Comfortable and good looking Also great quality

I like that these sneakers can be dressed up or down I wear mine with Dr school insoles for work as I am on my feet all day long I do not like that the shoe was too large and I had to exchange it which was not a very good experience

I have been rocking adidas shell tops since 83 I am 45 years old I bought these as a gift for my wife and she totally loves them Old school is the only school

This is my second pair of superstar shoes they are very comfortable look great last long

I bought these as a present for my son and he absolutely loved them

I find the very comfortable except the interior wears out far too quickly

No too small and too narrow I have had other Adidas and have not had this issue

I really like the design the accents and the color

This shoe is Adidas in all its glory Classics that pair well with just about any apparel and comfort for any activity

It looks very stylish and is comfortable for all activities

Superstars are classic and comfortable Buy some

Husband had these during his teen years had been wanting them again for a while he was pleasantly surprised this Christmas when Santa Claus brought them for him

Durable and dependable You guys should satisfied what the people say about your product Those 2 words are very powerful for your brand

I had the same shoe before but this one I do not know if it is the real one or not

they fit and it was easy to buy them using Apple Pay

Love the look very comfy and stylish Can get them in many colors I wish the womanbutterflies were still available from years ago I loved them

Adidas fit well wear well look good long lasting quality made sneakers and the main thing is that they are comfortable I like these so well that I am going to buy another pair next month only with the white stripes

I was pleasantly surprised when my shoes arrived and they were ALREADY laced Thanks Guys

I love the shoes but they are falling apart within 2 weeks of wearing them

They look great and are really cool I bought them for my granddaughter and she loved them

So I actually custom made my own superstar shoes I wanted a simple word on both shoes however when they got to my home they where the regular superstar shoes No custom anything So yeah

It is way too narrow at the front My feet are flip flopping But overall they look great especially with ankle socks

Love Love Love my superstar shoes made by adidas They fit true to size comfortable makes a fashion statement the never go out of style because they are a classic

The shoes are nice but they came dirty and they are white so Everyone can notice it That was the only problem However they pretty nice

I like this product because it looks very nice and goes with many outfits

Because it feels so comfortable and i can wear them with everything

The shoe sports a great look and it is very classy my adidas yeah

I like them cause I really like The classic look the white on white go with pretty much everything I have in the closet I have been getting superstars since I could but my own sneakers and thats when I was 16years old and I am now 45 does not that really say it all

These are honestly the best shoes I have ever had They are comfy and affordable and they look great

I like superstar shoes it is very comfortable

Shoe could be a bit wider Other than that good purchase

The show looks great and is made with the quality you would expect from adidas Unfortunately when my shoes came in with the personal text added to them it seemed like cheap vinyl they printed on

Cause it is dope and i love itxe2 x9d xa4 xef xb8 x8f Thanks adidas

A tad too narrow but other than that they are quite stylish and very comfortable

still have my old men original superstar shoes and i like it the new superstar now on size 7 and 7 1 2 only have 6 eyelets not the same on my old shoes with 7 eyelets love classics and original style

do not like how low the heel is in the back Feels like the shoe is going to fall off

Adidas are comfortable and stylish plus it is a part of the Hip Hop culture

Fashionable shoes Wanna buy ones again Also wears comfortable

Purchased a half size bigger fits perfectly even though it looks a little wide on my foot

Love all superstars but the black is very classic

The shoes go with just about everything in my husbandcloset

I have always wanted shell toes with my signature adjective juicy on them

the thing that messes my shoes Sizing is the problems i have to deal with

He loves the style of these shoes and unique details like the gold logo etc

Have been wearing superstars since the 80s do not discontinue them ever

I love the idea of creating your own shoes with the Superstar application but the colors were not true to what I looking at online I wanted red and received more of a pink orange color I am still hopeful for the second pair that I ordered

it is slightly narrow and somewhat longer than it should be for a size 10 but it could be because it is new

it is a beautiful shoe but it is somewhat longer and slightly narrow for the size 10 It might be because it is new

it is a nice looking shoe but it feels a little weird to wear it is somewhat narrow and a little long it is slightly uncomfortable but it could be because it is new

I like the product because they are comfortable and stylish but also because the quality is is amazing Definitely changed a large part of my closet

it is good and suitable for me it is good and suitable for me it is good and suitable for me it is good and suitable for me

I love the look of the product and they are extremely comfortable

Because Adidas is a Great Comfortable Brand From the Time I Ordered to the Time I got my Shipment I was and Still am Very Happy and will be Placing another Order Soon

Love the stan smith shoe Have been wearing these for years Get you a pair

This shoe is very comfortable and the customization is a very cool feature I was able to put my sonname and birthday on both shoes makes me smile looking down at them

it is even better when you put CHEEKI BREEKI on it

Because they really nice looking as well as being comfortable They go with just about any kind of outfit you wear and I just can not stop staring at them I really enjoy this shoe

So I purchased these shoes last year they held up exceptionally well i Have Cerebral Palsy with Drop Foot I drag my feet and walk on really the top right of my feet I normally go through shoes every two months Not these just under a year they lasted The rubber soles are super thick which i like they are comfortable also I decided to order the exact same shoes since they lasted so long through my shoe trials i have tried every brand you can think of and adidas have always done the best but these shoes are awesome

I like them because they are comfortable And they seem to last a long time

I think they are too cute I have bought these over and over again I have them in white too They are my go to fashion sneaker

classic shoe with a twist something different than the norm

Didnt fit well looks weird with a large size ordered a 13 and felt like 13 5

Great purchase fit perfect Gel inserts compliment the structure of the shoe

I like the product because I am a huge fan of the adidas superstars collection I was originally looking for the adidas superstars super colors but when I found this shoe I had to get it If there is anyone that knows where to get them let me know

They are shoes Order one half size bigger I am being asked to add more words

I have been buying the Superstar for years and love it I wanted an all white shoe so the gold trim on this one was the only drawback

Definitely recommend this product Not my first pair

The sole is super comfortable and the shoes are very clean looking

Love the suede they look even better in person Very cool shoes

I absolutely love these shoes I bought the white ones with black stripes two years ago and I wore them almost every day They are extremely comfortable and can go with any outfit After wearing them for about two years they did start to wear out and are not very white even after cleaning them Although they are still totally wearable I bought the all white ones a few weeks ago and I have no regrets These are my all time favorite shoes and I would definitely recommend them to everyone

The shoes are very good quality comfortable and iconic

its just awesome i am in love with these shoes

These shoes have great insoles Order was processed quick and shipped to my house within a few days Great buy

I am old school and I grew up wearing Adidas from the Run DMC error

Got this for my son and he simply lives the look and feel of the shoe

These shoes are super comfy and I love the gold I heard they ran big so I ordered a size smaller than I usually wear and they got perfect

Love them but they run about a half size too small and are a bit narrow in width other than that I have been wearing them for years and am used to them i love them

Not comfortable feel uneven and very narrow They look great though

The all white superstars are extremely comfortable have a beautiful minimalistic design and are some of the highest quality shoes i have purchased I would recommend them to anyone who wants to add a little premium spice to an outfit of their own They are easy to clean you can honestly use leather cleaner or just wipes to clean them and when the laces get dirty I just pop them in the washing machine and they look brand new What I love most about adidas shoes is the comfort and how long they last Great purchase

I love the classic shell toes they are so comfortable They do not bend easily like most other brand shoes I can even put them in the washer and they come out looking brand new I love adidas maybe one day I can do reviews for them

Great buy Only wish they had wide sizes as its quite narrow

This is my first time actually getting the originals I was a little skeptical I did not think they would look good but after i broke them in and loosened them up it became a great fit I am a big adidas fan that is basically all I wear and I am very satisfied with this shoe

these are the only shoes my son wears keep making them

This product is good I propose that we get bulk purchase in Ghana

Love that you can customize the shoes My son has been wanting these forever but could not find them in his size anywhere Thank you for making him happy

I got this item do to its classic look and the color scheme Improvements could be made around the v and to prevent discomfort

These shoes look great feel great and are extremely versatile Great for running and skateboarding

I love these shoes I love these shoes I love these shoes

It looks nice And it is so famous Everyone likes it

Shoes are too big at the back but still too narrow on the sides Easy to slip on and off though which is the real reason I got them Good looking as well

Classic just as I remember them Added a lil flair

I keep coming back to this shoe because they last forever and are waterproof Last pair was white and they turned grey brown after years of use I am hoping this time I can use black shoe polish to keep them looking sharp

First this is definitely a lifestyle fashion sneaker so you have to compare it with other fashion style sneakers The comfort is perfect a lot of support and cushion I wear a 15 and was worried about the toe cutting too short but the length is perfect The width is slightly tight but a simple fix by adjusting the laces You will lose some of that slender look if you care about such things but they WILL NOT make you look bulky by any means As a fashion shoe it is comparable with anything else on the market probably why it is been around for so long

it is just what I wanted to be I would not ask for anything else

Great retro style and look Seem more narrow than other Addidas purchases I have made over the years

My son has the black high tops he loves them But how do you clean them

Love the personalized signature on the shoes It looks so good

Yes but needs a little wide for my feet Needs to be more comfortable shoe

Used to love Adidas Now will never buy another pair until they start making much wider shoes available

The string around sole of shoe was delivered loose

I like this product for its style look and  comfort

Good quality and style Perfect for school or wearing out

I like the shoe the style I wear about a 6 1 2 menusually but I needed a 5 1 2 in these Seems to run big European size is more accurate Had I known that I would not have had to order and return about 4 time to get the right shoe

Classics Perfect style comfort and looks A must have

ALways been an adidas fan Old school shoes for me

I like those shoes because they are a classic and has a nice style

Will the brand consider using eco leather in futureThe model is amazing and it never goes out of style but with people going vegan more and more it will be sad not to be able to wear a cruelty free version of it

nice detail free shipping perfect size big fan of it

i use it for dance sometimes and its ok

They provide great support for the arch of your foot and it is just like buying a already broken in pair of shoes so comfortable and great quality

comfortable beautiful and stylish I am so happy

They are classic comfortable inexpensive and the best of the best

Awesome It was a bday gift to my husband and he love it

Overall happy with them and would recommend

These are amazingly stylish and super comfortable They definitely fit my jet set traveling lifestyle

Get dirty easily

As a dancer Superstars give my toes great support and hug my foot overall in a way that will not hurt my feet after performing

Comfort style timeless design love them Would buy again

Just got my second pair of Adidas superstars Im IN LOVE with the rose gold

Replaced a worn out pair of the same shoe Will more than likely do it again

Classic shoes Look great with everythingFit perfectly

THEY CAME FAST LIKE IN 2 DAYS WICH AS REALLY GOOD SO YEAH

I really like these shoes I usually wear an 8 but ordered a 7 1 2 because other reviews said they ran large They fit perfectly and are very comfortable I really like the rose gold accents

I have boxy feet i wide with short toes and most athletic shoes have gotten too narrow over the years Adidas came recommended and I am very happy They fit like skate shoes with the style and comfort of tennis shoes Perfect combo

What ever happened to the old style of Superstar shoesI really like that look better

Very pleased with my purchase and especially after speaking with a friend who recommended ordering smaller I normally wear an 8 5 or 9 in women and ordered these in an 8 Love the color with the rose gold

Great and beautiful shoes Love them Special appearance and comfort Unfortunately I ordered a larger size but still very satisfied thank you very much Adidas

It was a gift for my daughter and she loved it I would totally recommend this for a gift

Hi Adidas This is not a Superstar Bounce Looks like a partially gum outsole

They are very comfortable and look sharp Exactly what he was looking for

Simplicity of design cooly stated none of those hideous color and fabric combinations with these shoes perfection

I have been wearing the superstar shoe for more than 20 yrs I have yet to see a shoe outlast it is durability This shoe is always a go tofor me It never goes out if style and as long as adidas keeps making them It will keep buying them

I love this cuz it is comfy and cute also it is very trendy and mateches any outfit

I like the shoe color and the design I was very disappointed about the quality this is actually my first time buying adiadas shoes I like the styles and everything but it was a bit disappointed I am not the type of person that returns stuff so I just keep them

I really like it But it is really hard to find women sizes in this color I am 6 5 so I had to buy 7 after looking for a looooong time cause I wanted it so bad I suggest adidas make all tennis shoes in every size it is not fair to women when they like men styles and I do not think there should be gender styles btw

Them they are comfortable and well made

I love the simple and classice look and can pretty much make any outfit complete with them I have the black and white pink and white and the gold and white can not wait to add more



Suit jeans or sports wear Comfortable and look trendy absolutely love them

Color Style and Comfort they fit perfectly and they express my Style seamlessly

The shoe is made from ultra durable full grain leather This is the most comfortable and best quality shoe ever made Addidas got it right 40 years or so ago Simply the best

I am an 80s kid and these are perfect for all my others in the collection

A1 product Real nice Lots of compliments from the ladies

They look amazing and very comfortable Super clean and easy to wash since I have the black version with white stripped and gold accents I ride a motorcycle and have to switch gears with left foot it is nice cause these shoes have the rubber fronts so it is grippy and I will not constantly wear down the material do not cheap out and buy shoes that will have to be replaced in a couple months buy these

I wear a 9 5 in womenand ordered a 7 5 They fit great

steps are fine not my first pair gettin cheaper lookin though no more questions please

The color is nice and subtle not overpowering One of the better pair of shell toes I have owned

I had to torture these shoes with 36 miles of conference walking before they failed on me AFTER having worn them regularly for weeks shy of a year I have only alternated between my all black Adidas and my all white Adidas during this past year whether for work or play The most incredible part is even when they failed they still looked great lol My wife had to point out where the shell toe was beginning to separate from the shoe or I would not have noticed

Stylish comfortable functional Perfect for my son who runs daily

In addition it matches all outfit easily

I love Adidas i have worn these since the 80s I just miss the fresh 2g Coming back with these would be huge for your sales

Timeless shoe never lets me down always reminds me of the 80 

The leather looks good and color is subtle does not stand out too much but just enough to be noticed by onlookers A real hot shoe

just cheap looking and cheap made not the quality of old

Not much else to say

These are not the most comfortable shoes but they look nice

Great looking shoe that fits my daughters foot good

I personally like the all black best thing is you can wear with shorts or pants not all sneakers have that flexibility

Great looking shoe Ran a little narrow but probably just need to be broken in a little bit

Ive always had these shoes from a young age and up to now My last pair which I still wear from time to time is 15 yrs I figured it was time to get a new one

Adidas are the shoes to go with Comfty and stylish

Looks good Fits good Really comfortable Really Nice

Just what I was looking for I love the green stripes Go Packers

too narrow for me but a good shoe nice colorway and a reasonable price

I bought the sneakers for my brother but he did tell me that he loves them He only wears adidas

They go with everything and are super comfy They do not stay white long but still look good

Amazing product design is amazing and comfortable

One of the best best best beeeeessstttt

Always have loved the shoe but to hard on feet Not much cushion in sole

It is great looking doesnt tear or wear away very fast even when i skate in them

Perfect Summer or all around shoe period Goes with any fit that has a hint of burgundy without too much distraction on my feet Super Simple Simplistic

They are absolutely Superstars

Bouth this classic shelltop Superstar in green similar to the original green Stan Smith Love its versatility for casual or athletic use Quality is still good since 30 years ago and looks great

The product itself is superb I could really feel the quality just by touching it I would say online shopping is convenient but it would better or more superb for user if there is a form of way for the electronic device to get the size legth or width of our body so that we could choose the apparel size correctly For example like developing an AI that could scan our body

very stylish and comfy you do not regret it bought 3 one for me 2 for my 2 bros

Classic adidas originals perfect with everything only issue for me turned out to be the size I had to return the ones I got originally and had to order a size smaller rest all is perfect

Love it Comfy functional for lots of activities Gets dirty pretty easily but just as easy to clean Handles wear and tear good for long walks or even more athletic things

Absolutely perfect like always Adidas always doing the best

my foot is loose in it every time I take a step it feels like the shoe is coming off and my size is 12 if I get 1 2 size smaller than my foot will hurt in it so personally this shoe is definitely not for me

I am using it since 1970I use it whenever I play tennis

Shoes are crafted with high quality Very pleased with the purchase

The quality and personal details I added were fantastic

Classic looks and great quality materials Highly recommended

This new pair of superstar is very comfortable and fashionable

sleek clean look with comfort it goes very well with white tees

Too narrow Need to offer wide widths Hurts my feet

this sneaker comes in assorted colors it reminds me about the good old days

Product is great however I ordered the wrong size

I am a fifth grade teacher These shoes are in my school colors I can not wait to wear them on spirit Fridays

Great shoe you cant beat that old school classic

Stylish and classic design I would not recommend for long walks or strenuous workouts

Fancy and comfortable

I was really excited about these shoes but they were incredibly uncomfortable in the forefoot region especially when I took a step off the ground I also found the back of my feet lifting out of the shoe too much I do not know if others have had this problem but I tried 6 different pairs of these shoes but had the same problem each time

This is a classic shoe been wearing them since the 80and they always look good

These shoes were a gift for my friend She absolutely loves them Thank you

I like the shoes very much but had visible footprints on the inner sole Shoe was already worn and not new as it was sold

Great style and comfortable too Got it at a great price too

It is simple to have something to match with and a nice color

Look very nice on my feet and with the clothes I wear them with

These Adidas are super cute and the colors are understated but look really nice

Looks good wears well so far at least Like seemingly all Adidas shoes it runs narrow forcing me to go to a larger size and thus being a little long

They are too narrow A wide sized option would be appreciated

Because I choose it and I like it the color red and white is my favorite color

Nice colorway not found in stores I laced them with fat white laces

The quality is great and  it fit real good I will tell my friends

The Color Fresh sneaker green for the summer time Nice casual look

Adidas was and is a good fit for me the price is great and I just love them

I am a big fan of adidas This shoe is must have item it is nice shoes Love it

Awesome shoes I definitely recommend these if you are looking for something comfortable casual

These shoe are comfortable and very stylish along with the color combination makes it a great shoe

Like this colour But the shoes quality bought from the online shop is not that good as the local shop

Not as comfortable as I expected but their are ok

good service received in 2 days very comfortable shoes

These were were sought after as the best ball shoes back in my high school days in the 70Same high quality shoe I probably paid more back then

These are really stylish shoes that are decently comfortable Comfort is somewhat subjective but as far as what the footbed feels like it feels slightly cushy but firm with a tiny bit of a bouncy foam feel You should probably go down half a size unless you are a wide footer since these shoes are slightly narrow The reason you should go down half a size is because the heel of the shoe does not lock your heel in well when going true to size it feels like you are wearing slippers it is still slightly present when going down half a size but it starts to go away when you break the shoe in A simple fix is to wear slightly thicker socks The shoe can pinch your toes a little when new but once they get broken in which is about a three or so wears for a few hours a piece that pretty much goes away Overall great shoe that I am really happy with

I loved this product great confort and style shoes

I love Superstars and buy pair after pair My only complaint is that they are too narrow for my feet

Amazing colour Amazing fit It is perfect can not say anymore

Always been a fan of Superstar I have not worn one in about 10 years and it is just like how I remembered it Slightly narrow Digging the dark red color it is slightly darker than shown on the website

It is a good shoes Design so pretty the price is ok

Comfortable shoes that last a while as long as you are not walking in them all day every day They only last a few months like that Over all satisfied with them

Most comfortable shoes ever Great multi purpose shoe

I love Adidas and I love Originals They are not exactly the original Superstar as they modernized a couple things 10 lower and they go from good to great 

Love them Shell tops Been rocking the pair since the 80s

Very stylish sleek and smooth Love how they look

Old school no drama best looking shoes in the gym

I like the old school look of all of the adidas originals

The comfort of the shoe is awesome and can go with so many outfits

I absolutely love these shoes I could not wait to wear them

Like being back in high school Bit narrower than I remember and I felt some raised lines and bumps inside when I wear thinner socks

The shoes are top quality material and very comfortable

Awesome Just wish the tongue was like the original

Perfect product I should buy another one at that time

This product is a classic style for adidas not to mention that the price was perfect

definitely would recommend great shoe and very low prices

can not beat these Superstars My 10th pair Will buy again

Love the style A bit narrow as I have wide feet but it conforms after wearing them a couple days

Old school comfortable and still stylish All around great shoe

the shade of red is nice fits great and dealssssss

I love the fit price selection and colors Glad I shopped online

bought them for my daughter she loves the superstars and the different colors

I have been buying the shoes since 1970 they have always had a great field to them would recommend them to everybody

Original Superstar were perfect for 8090PArty

Been buying superstars since 1968 As good now as back then

So nice an comfortable very chic can wear with anything

Shoe definitely does not resemble what is in the picture it has more of an orthotics look Speaking or orthotics these were not comfortable so you probably need to buy an insert Really bummed because these looked great online

In general I was satisfied Great product super star 80

I have owned Adidas Superstars before and the update to the materials and cushioning is fantastic Same great classic look with way more comfort I just love these shoes I am just waiting until I can get a few more pairs

I like it because it looks nice but it is a little to tight

Classic that can be worn with everything and enhances the fit

They are original superstars had to cop them that is all

Excellent custom shoe order Arrived quickly no problems made perfectly

I noticed several aesthetic issues Small issues pne would not initially notice Overall great look

Love the shell toe Wore them in my teens and where them now Plus the maroon on white is awesome

The heel is to wide but the front fit it flops off

so comfort and love the color big fan of adidas superstar

Had a pair of these in high school still like them

Stylish and very comfortable I bought another pair right away

The shoes look great and feel amazing Almost as if I was not wearing any shoes at all

I liked the product but I was a little disappointed with the quality It had pulled threads toe cap looked like it had a lil issue I may be too detail oriented on the hand I still love my adidas Great job to the team

The shoes that I purchased reminded me of the ones I had as a young teenager

Love the Original model and that these are always in style

A little tight on its width but I love it will defenitely buy more

Old school is the new school is why I like them ha

Love the color i ordered 8 5 and i returned cause was too narrow wide were to tide there were no 9 anymore but i ordered in other color and is perfect now

Throwback to the 70 and 80 Extremely happy with these Great price also Thank you

It is perfect with good quality and lower price The color is my favorite

it is perfect it matches everything I was expecting

I have been wearing the Superstar sneaker for the past 30 years or so This pair is being used for dance shoesI glue chrome leather to the sole and I get a pair of shoes for lindy hop that is comfortable and supports and protects my feet

I was not sure about sizing because i have about 20 pairs of different adidas and the superstars are different i needed an 11 but i got 10 1 2 I am still going to wear them but i wish i had a bigger size

Just what I ordered product was delivered quickly as promised keep up the good work

I love them Very comfortable High Quality and very clean

OMG Such a throwback Takes me back in time to the 80Makes me think about my teenage years

A stylish and good shoe little high in the arches But breaking in and getting better But as usual pleased with adidas products

Great I have been rocking Adidas since I was a kid I am 48 years old now keep doing what you do with data

These shoes make your feet look great They are comfortable to walk long distances with no pain They make so many outfits extra fashionable

Everything was great I liked the product very much

I love these shoes however I am having a hard time with the heels My heel keeps sliding up and down when I walk I thought maybe it was just me and my feet however one of my friends also got a pair and she is having the same issues Love the shoes not happy about the fit Hopefully with wearing them more I will break them in but so far wearing for 4 days no luck and I may be getting a blister

14 hrs of standing and I did not feel a thing really

I have been buying adidas for a long time love them

I especially enjoyed the comfort style and simple design elements

Feeling young again lots of great memories They look and feel like thy did 30 years ago

it is a stylish shoe that I like

it is my favorite shoes I have 3 diferents superstar and I am happy whit those

Shell Heads are CLASSICS Its a must have sneaker

i love the product for it is comfort design and make

Quality materials They go well with almost anything

I was not happy with the style I wanted the old school type with no gold on the tongue and I got gold on the tongue so not very happy with the product

Thick leather makes shoe tighter than some others of the same size Great quality

Very durable sneaker Awesome purchase Glad I bought them

This shoe is Much more comfortable then I originally thought

Great shoe looks great feel great goes with everything

I bought for my boyfriend he love it The was very good

Always have been a fan of Superstars Have 15 plus pairs and keep buying as the colors change

Adidas Superstr has the classic style and great feel The crisp white with sky blue really makes it pop

Classic shoe with perfect quality material Exact size Very comfortable wearing Very quick delivery

Really really confortable It has a good balance between quality and price

Best shoes ever The blue stripes are awesome they were only on the menthough You guys need more colors I love the patterns Need purple stripes and more patterns for these shoes I have 3 pairs already I keep checking for more options

My favorite shoes bottom line nothing more to say

Lazy comfortable shoes that have style and others compliment all the time

These shoes are awesome I have been awaiting their return for so long However I do wish they were styled more like the older superstars I am not such a big fan of the flat sole shoes but they are very comfortable

Comfortable on feet Great looking shoes A must own kind of shoe

We actually give the product to our SquADD Superstar of the month Each candidate loves the shoe Since our company is owned by Russell Simmons the shoes are a great perk

timeless shoe looks as good today as it did in the 70when I wore it in high school

They are beautiful and comfortable and excellent price

every thing was perfect product fits very well would recomend to my friends

they are stylish and just comfortable most of all I like the way the shoes looks on my feet

Retro memories from high school in the early seventies

My Superstars are very comfortable I wear them as a work shoe in a retail environment on my feet a lot from warehouse to sales floor they remain comfortable and durable and I look good

I have worn Superstars since the 80I can get almost a full year out of a pair The sizing is consistant so I am able to order online with confidence that they will fit Good to see all of the colors again

Aside from receiving what I expected I liked the color scheme which was perfect for my 10 yr old daughter

Great classic tennis shoes to wear with jeans or a sundress

Despite having a wide foot these shoes have been awesome Classic look and now very comfortable after being broken in Looking to get another pair with a different color it is the definition of form meeting function

love the style the quality and service a must to have

We just love the originals Just ordered more can not wait

The shoes are dope and very comfortable Just had one issue A weird rattle in the soles while walking Felt like something was loose inside the sole but nothing I could visually see Still would recommend them and plan on getting more pairs in the future

Shipping was incredibly fast The shoe did run a little big and I have not even had them for 4 months and they are already falling apart Definitely not the quality I expected for the price I paid

What is there not to love about the all starthats right NOTHING These shoes are as awesome as they have ever been If I have ANY complaint it is that they do not make more of them with black bottoms All the other colors show dirt way too fast Love the black though

Superstars are my favorite could put alot of the older superstar colors online for purchase

I love these shoes I wear them every day I highly recommend them You will need to break them in but they are awesome

Love the fact that I could customize the shoes with my last name

Classic 70s style that brings back memories during my high school days Great materials and fit except it is not made in Germany or France like it used to be

The stretch out way to much I bought a size 12 Wore for a few days and they became way to big Then decided to go buy a size 11 5 The fit perfectly for about 2 weeks and then stretched out way to much Now are a little big for me

I love it for its quality durability confort

Loved these sneakers Had not had the superstar since the 80s The only thing is I am normally a size 10 Found it a bit big But I kept them I just ordered another pair but with burgundy stripes I think I will try to buy 2 more pairs

Who would not like the Original Sky Blue adidas Throw back at it is finest

great casual but dressy look for summer and hanging out

This is probably my third pair of this model Like it a lot Everyday use comfortable and tough keep it up Adidas

Have always loved the superstar sneaker One of the best sneakers ever released

My boyfriend will only wear these shoes literally until they fall apart Not many stores sell the size 13 he needs so I am always having to order them Always a great experience

They are the best So beautiful and comfortable I would recommend this item

Great shoes Perfect fit very comfortable Delivered very quickly Happy

I love it Super cute comfortable shoes Perfect for wearing all day outside Plus I received a ton of compliments

my daughter loves them she has many adiads sneakers

Great sneaker my daughter loves them has many pairs of adidas products

Very nice and OG shoe Must have shoe for anyone starting a collection

Based on the reviews I expected these shoes to run largehowever they were a bit small and narrow for me If you wear a size 10 in dress shoes I suggest you order a 10 5 in these shoes Quality seems good and the shoes are comfortable with good arch support

Durable

Love the Superstars been buying them for the past 10 years Quality is always mixed but this model release looks perfect like my older pairs Shoe laces were the only problem extremely long old man bunny ear style Had to replace the laces but other than that perfect

Love the Superstar I am a sneaker head and to me the Superstar just feels right I have worn everything from Jordans to Brooks the superstar just seems to feel better I guess the name says it all The Superstar truly is a Superstar thanks adidas

good shoe very good shoegood shoe very good shoegood shoe very good shoegood shoe very good shoe

I love this product because it brings me back to when I was a teenager and it was cool to wear a sneaker like this

Classic design Fun Fit well Arrived quickly Great

Fit feel and look great

Classic adidas look great for casual days can not wait for my next purchase

Looks really great and love the style Just a little too big for me

Comfy very good quality and best of all it is Adidas

Comfortable and stylish look good for walking around on the weekend

I am a superstar collector and this product has nice color nice shape look very unique

Because I have the Celtic green tracksuit superstar original

I love the style of the superstar and Samoa shoes I love the colored blending with the white color of the shoes or vice versa

I solely use adidas as work shoes because they are durable and have decent arch support I have had this exact pair before and was happy to be able to buy it again The break in process take a few day but after that they are like wearing house slippers

Love Sneaker had them in late 70great throwback

I had a pair of these years ago I noticed the classic design was back and bought a pair The Superstars are not quite as narrow as I recall

I had these when they originally came out years ago and now I get to have them again excellent

Product was exactly what i wanted Came on time the price was a steal

best sneakers for last 20 years wish blue lacings were available without customizing

I like adidas since I was a kid that is the brand I always use very comfortable and neat

Classic shoe That remained a staple sneaker through out the decades not many shoes have done that

It runs bit big but runs too narrow fit and finish was below my expectation So it was returned looks pretty though

Excellent product Fits Perfect Wonderful price

I loved the shoes they were delivered on time they were exactly what I wanted and it was the overall great experience

I may be look for another red color

Nice classic sneaker and good quality Get half size larger than normal size

good design and color that match the white background

Superstars like all other Adidas goods I have owned are well made

been wearing these same shoes for 21 yrs and they are always perfect right out the box no need to break in or have insoles

Exactly what you expect Great color Great fit True to size Well shipped Thanks

Good ole superstars Nothing fancy but all classic

This is my second pair of Adidas and my first all star pair I really love them

These shoes were very stylish and comfortable I will order again

This item is long lasting and comes in available sizes

was a little narrow and a little large but very comfortable

The shoes fits perfectly I really like the style Never gets old

Great fit and best looking shoe want black one now

I got this shoes for my mid schooler soon and he loves them

Classic look nice quality good fit a little on the narrow side but will stretch to fit

I have had superstars in the past and they fit good The pair I ordered this time were too narrow and they are currently in transit for a return

First basketball shoe in college 1977 Mott College Basketball in Flint MI

Love the comfort and the style These are classics and I rebuy this style in different colorways often

My husband is 63 and this is the only shoe he wears and has ever worn going back to his high school basketball days So glad I can still find them The price was right the shipping was free and they were here in a day

I like the design and how it fits everyone asked me about it

You should make a wide version of these to help with not so narrow feet

and she is not easy

Classic Styling Old School Charm Great Fit Purchasing a different color today

I love superstars in general but the I love absolutely loved them in this color The blue striped and gold logo compliment each other well

Always love Adidas products for the price and quality

Perfect fit and great comfort for a week of walking in Spain

This is a product that suits on every casual Its perfectly suits my leg

Great shoe but half a size too small Great material and craftsmanship

Wow Going from Nike to my first Superstar was incredible These shoes are much more comfortable The leathers are high quality the shell toe protects your foot and with basic leather conditioner you can keep them looking sharp for years The looks kill they go with anything and people will compliment you on the old school style I have the black white and white black stripes They DO run a little big but if you have a wide foot go true to size The leather will stretch a little I can squeeze half a size down but my toes cry The shell toe is rigid enough that a hair of extra toe space does not feel too big could not recommend these enough though Thinking about getting my third pair

The only sneaker that keeps that fresh style look

im back again in adidas and i have to regrets buying it and i just bought 2 pairs hahaha i love it

Look and style of sneaker and the Adidas reputation

Awesome look but ruined it with the gold should have kept it black and white

I purchased sneakers for my boyfriend which he loves wearing them He rocks them every weekend He said the fit is good and loves his adidas

I love these shoes so much They arrived in amazing condition and they were super comfortable and fit perfect Nice work Adidas

I have a pair of Adidas that fit perfect because it is a wide width I can not find wide width sneakers on the web site

The bad thing is one of the lace is 138cm and another is 155cm why you will make this mistakeIt makes me need to buy a pair of new lace too disappointed

1st pair very poor product discoloration Took forever to rectify

The Adidas Shell toe is a classic you can not help but love them but in these new designs I noticed the shells Top part opens up with a few wears While I had the old one which I wore for years and turned it into a ball shoe and it never did that

I enjoy the shoes very much but need a bigger size

confortable shoe very light I wear it everyday cool

I like it Very classic sneaker looks great would buy again

Very stylish shoe one of my favorite sneakers to wear Go true to size as you kind of want a snug fit on these

Comfortable and look sharp Love the differs colors

the product is very comfortable and is very stylish

I think my feet up in these shoes are very uncomfortable

Great style Good fit Durable Rubber front feels odd though

looks cheap now thin insole flops around no support

Classic shoe that never goes out of style I have been wearing Superstars for 40 years

Love the shoe best birthday gift He love them

These shoes were beyond comfortable They were the perfect size and did not crush or cause any discomfort on my feet I would recommend this to anyone looking for good looking nice shoes Not only were these shoes comfortable they were also nice looking

I love these shoes I had a slight problem with my order but customer service took care of it in a timely manner Thank you Adidas I suggest this product to anyone who likes to look lit

Made so cheap Embarrassing to wear Cheap plastic looking leather and cheap rubber Glue everywhere can not even print letting right look at theand theSeveral years ago to me this was the best shoe made and then they wanted a higher profit Just wrong

Best sneaker ever clean classic look easy to keep clean

Had to buy menbecause there are never women sizes I have been looking for months

I have been waiting to buy these shoes for months Now that I have I am thoroughly disappointed For the price the quality is poor The shoe is stiff and bulky As everyone says the shoe runs large by half a size full size Just the process of finding the right size was exhausting enough Also I have pretty normal sized feet I am a US Women8 5 I have never ever had a problem with any other sneaker before but these prove to be unusually narrow at the middle and SO uncomfortable Seriously I walked in them for 10 minutes and my feet were soo sore the next day I never write negative reviews but I really felt the need to warn people to ignore the hype Save your money and time And I strongly urge Adidas to reconsider their sizing and fitting for this product

I like this shoe it is very comfortable however the shoe that I got did not match the picture In the picture the tongue of the shoe has gold in it and mine does not

im a men my size is 9 5 which size recomended to me

Just recently got these They are most beautiful shoes I have ever seen

This is a very good shoe it is very comfortable

I ordered because my grand daughter wanted the shoes for a Christmas present I was very pleased with Customer Service

This is definitely one of my favorite pairs of shoes I got them last May I wear them almost every day and they are still in very good shape I 100 recommend

I have owned the same type of shoe for 17 years now I love the superstar 2 I mean 17 years and then it was discontinued and I went to superstars ok fine I still love them but now Gold why it was black and white why would you ruin that with gold I am so angry I do not know what to do they were perfect shoes and you had to ruin them why

Omg I love these shoes they seem a little loose at first but just tighten the laces and its perfect I love adidas soooo much I am a size 9 In womenyou can get them cheaper by a few dollars if you order in kids like and 9 in womenis a 7 in kids

These shoes are great I got them customized for a special event and adidas was nice enough to hurry up the process for me and I got them in 5 days They look great and the customization was a great choice

Gotta be honest I stepped away for a while from Adidas but I am so glad I am back these look better than ever you got a customer for life Adidas is back and it is on fire

Its a classic shoe who doesnt love shell toessssss

Purchased three pair for all different ages and everyone loves them

These are not the way they used to be They used to be my favorite shoe now they are extremely narrow and cheap quality I will not be buying them again at all

Normally I wear a 9 in womenand I wear a 8 1 2 in these shoes but they are really nice

comfortable to wear I wish I could buy 10 pairs like this

I love these shoes soo much they are soo comfortable

I am in love with my white and black stripe adidas

Big Fan of Adidas Products For a long while now

I have had 6 pairs of these shoes over the years and they are my all time favorite Whoever says that they do not last or prematurely come apart is just simply out of there mind Some of my older pairs I wore so long that the soles got holes in them after about 2 years of course A perfect shoe for everyone from a school girl to a hip hop fanatic Peace and one love

I like that I got to customize my own name on them

I liked the product because it looked cute and comfortable

I like the product everything came perfectly as i had seen in the photos the packaging was nice too

THEY ARE COOL THEY FEEL GREAT AND THEY LOOK GREAT

it is OK little pricey I do not know what else to say

Exactly what I was looking for good size and comfortable

I Love Adidas Products Have for a long time LONG BEFORE ANYBODY EVEN HEARD WHAT A NIKE WAS

A great looking shoe Classic styling and comfortable

Bought them from my younger brother and he loves them Perfect fit for a size 15

Super comfortable and attractive I absolutely love them and plan to buy more I have 3 in a variety of colors

Great quality The clothing all fits perfect Very pleased

I have been wearing the same style for 40 plus years

there is no competition shoes to these ones trust me I tried them all

I love the style but the fit is not great it hurts the sides of my feet after about an hour of wear

I do not like it this time because to large what can I do

The product was eactly what I wanted and the personalization looked great These were for my sonwedding and I had the date put on the shoes worn by the men standing up in the wedding I placed my order and they delivered within 2 days

a little glue messiness and little scratches here and there but other than that pleased

it is too uncomfortable and too wide I expected way better quality

The inside of the shoe was not even attached the shoe was basically apart

Good product Would purchase again online Great service

Evergreen shoe Fits all styles I love my superstars

A classic I love them always have a fresh set to wear

Great quality super comfortable so glad these are back

Having purchased these shoes in the past I was surprised that it actually hurts my foot to wear them so hopefully that will stop soon enough and become the very comfortable shoe that I have grown to enjoy previously

Just the perfect style for me They go well with a blue jean or with a black suit Classic and perfect

Wore original Superstars back in the day These rock Just like they did

I love the style But my problem is it is too loose on my heels I normally wear a size 7 5 8 and I end up buying a 6 5 but the heels is still slipping off

Always loved the shoe You should bring back the white tongue on the black and white pair though

I liked it great looking shoes I would like to purchase another adidas shoes next time

Nice shoes great fit and on time delivery Good experience

Love them they run a bit too big so size down

I wore Adidas for years and then took a break for Nike Vans New Balance etc Anyway I am back the quality and style is top notch and should be noted I look like a rock star in my Superstars keep up the good work Space

I like the feel of the product and durability good online purchase

Gift for my husband He has several pairs of Adidas shell toe sneakers

great shoe love it Would order again shipping was fast

Great shoes fit is bigger then the other shell tops i owned tho not enough to send back but i would recommend a 5 size smaller

These are a classic that never ages Quality looks and confort all great The shell toe is too narrow so you may want to order half a size up I have average width feet and ordered half a size up

Adidas logo inside one shoe was missing and there was a stain on the from of the shoe

I have been wearing Superstars since the late 80they fit me better than any other brand and stand up to the abuse I put them through Use them for both casual and work wear

I wear Superstars for 8 years I love the design

I bought them strictly for the look not for comfort

My daughter loves her shoes great product Wears to work great all day comfort

Hard to go wrong with classic Adidas style and quality

Even though this is a menshoe I had to have them because they are so awesome They were too large so even though I went with the suggested size I had to return them for a smaller size WORTH IT I dance A Lot Zumba and MixxedFit These shoes are great to dance in The painterly sides are just too gorgeous Happy

I saw a lot of stars wearing them and they looked so casual and comfy so I wanted to give them a try and they do look great on me just saying

Great look glad they were still available but now they are very narrow in size It would be nice to see wide sizing

Simple and iconic design Go well with any kind of clothes

I like this particular adida especially the splash colors it also represents equality for all

Looks great feels good like the different material stripes

At first they pretty comfy but then after a few days they started bending know a weird spot and hurting my feet I have plantar fasciitis and metatarsalgia pain so it is very important for me to have comfortable shoes

The shoes was too rough size wasnt fitting right

I like the design and the feel it gives its owner but the interior is not really comfortable

Good purchase You just have to check your right size because this shoes have different sizing

The from section of my on the right where the last shoe lace hole is the she was not soawed well and is barely together by a string

I love the shoes esp design for lgbt Adidas is a quality shoes for every age

It looks nice and it fits well There where no issues with quality

I love the product it is really comfortable and good quality

Shoes were in perfect condition just as pictured Personalization was perfect as well

My son loves the sneakers The style and color allow him to wear them with a variety of things

They are perfect love the colors love the feel of them

Perfect color and shoe for my daughter also could not get style that we wanted so ordered on line and got in a few days

I love Adidas and the looks I get while wearing these shoes

So comfortable I was not sure if they would fit because I would never worn these before

Fits the style of clothes I wear with them Comfortable

great looking shoes with jeans or shorts very casual look

Wondering why they put the word Superstar on them and the gold but still like these shoes Liked the original black and white ones better without superstar and gold back

Everything about them are awesome I have gotten nothing but complements

Old school Not too flashy This shoe gives me the style and comfort I want

My favorite shoes are the shell toes and the colors are awesome

Nice comfort looks good very stylish Satisfied

It is beautiful Me and my friends love it

ADIDAS ROCK I would recommend to all my friends

it is a good show just maybe lower the priceFor the price payed they better last for a year or two

Always loved the originality of the Adidas sneaker and this particular product upholds the legacy of Adidas

Super comftoetable especially to walk long distances

Visually the shoe it self is amazing However shoe is a little bit too narrow compared to the other superstars I have own Not sure if it was because men and women superstars are made differently

Love the style of the shoes and the way they fit and feel on my feet

good good good good good good good good good good good

Just purchased these and a matching pair for my wife

I like this shoes and mark adidas original goooooooood

Unique blend of design and superstar sneakers But size is slightly larger

Yes very nice AND confortable pair you can combine with all colors

I was told the quality of the shoe would be better if purchased from adidas directly I think th are A little better

it is nice I like this style it is comfortable Good quality

I love them but you should ask for a smaller size i usually use 38 so i read many reviews i was not sure so i bought 37 5 they are a little bit bigger i dowload the size chart based on the cms of my feet 25cms i should ask for a 38 so i recommend to buy one smaller i think 37 shoul fit perfectly anyway i will use socks for a better fit besides that they are what i expect really nice

Love the rainbow colors on the bottom of the shoe

Great shoes The OG originals are the best I recommend these sneakers

Very comfortable but the customization did not work on the site

That three stripes and the good looking Very attracting

My girls LOOOOVE their personalized superstars They even get feedback from total strangers about how beautiful they are

I have gotten so many comments on my shoes I love them so very much They are a great fit to my personaility

I love it very comfortable and very nice and the color

I should have went a half a size down because they slide off my feet

I thought they were really popular so I bought them

I like it because it is nice to wear a superstar shoes

Fits amazing and look great i would recommend them

Looks good from my childhood days It bring Back fond memories

Classic Not much else needed to be said here really

I do like the product I just recommend ordering a half size to one size down because they are cut large

Very comfortable and the style is dope but after a week or two of everyday wear the shell toe became separated from the sides of the shoe now they look awful and feel weird when I wear them I was very dissatisfied especially because of how expensive they are

It represents me Best quality and very beautiful

Love these shoes Definitely recommend them to anyone

Front of the shoe where the shell toe and the shoe meet will bust after 6 months of wear Only worn twice a week Same thing with 3 other friends who bought this same shoe would not recommend this at all

This was my first adidas product and I love it so much very comfortable and just a great shoe I would recommend it to my friends

I love these shoes but 20 years ago when I bought them they were 40 cheaper Why the heck are they so expensive

it is nothing I have ever seen before I wanted something different and these were totally different

Very good quality a must have in every closet its an iconic and matches with everything

Nice to have a great pair of sneakers that remind me of my childhood and made with vegan materials

These are some of the best shoes I have ever worn 3 years ago I purchased a version of these shoes that I customized and only now are they starting to wear out I was excited to buy a new pair but disappointed to see that adidas no longer offers a size 15 option for the customizable version of the shoe that is my only complaint with them Other than that you will not find a finer product

Great superstar for summer lightweight and very comfortable The color is perfect too

It fits perfect so many compliments on my shoes great quality

I have not worn them yet but opening that Box made my day The details and the colors are way better in person than the picture

Everything about the shoes are good however when I first wear it I had realised the inner sole is different in size one is my size but the other is definitely smaller than the other Comfort is good I love the design but finishing I would say can be improved

I bought 2 pair because I loved the look and feel so much

The design on these shoes is amazing and they are overall quite comfortable I do wish there was an option for a wider shoe though which would make them more comfortable

I purchased these as a female because they were sold out of the womenin my size and I am very happy with the decision Love the classic look of these shoes

the product was overall good but inside the sole of the shoe was not glued all the way so that was uncomfortable but overall it is a great shoe and I recommend it

really nice and looks nice perfect match for all of my clothes

They are comfortable Stylish and why not go with everything

I love this shoes and I love adidas en all my friends love

Love it only prob is that I should have gotten a size smaller

that is nice and comfortable somethings classic good deal

the product is very comfortable but I got a half size to big

The shoes at first I was kinda regretting my decision but through time I love them very much and will most likely purchase again

The figure and design is fashionable My friends like adidas too

it is very comfy and stylish I prefer the shape and texture of shoes It was very nice

Fit very well Fast shipping Styles great with almost anything Highly recommended

I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them They are her favorite pair of shoes

I like this product because it is a comfortable stylish pair of shoes

beautiful item great product always been adidas fan and will continue to be the greatest fan thank you adidas for your great products

Super nice shoes lots of compliments LGBT Support very colorfull and comfy

I love this special edition Comfortable and nice

They are beautiful shoes but the heel is too loose and the toes are too tight there is no balance Hence why I had to go with a size down for my heels to actually stay in the shoes while walking at the expense of my toes However they seem like they need some breaking in unlike other sneakers as that front has gotten better but not by much

I love this Super Star Because it has a unique personality

The customized version of this shoe is not like the original It is thin and cheap I have to buy the custom to get 13 5 size but the 13 5 size custom is not the same size as the last 3 pairs I ordered

Emotionally pumped to buy but returned as too narrow

I like adidas it is pretty confortable and lasts for a long period of time

Thank you Adidas for continuing to make these wonderful sneakers

Perfect shoes highly recommended Thank you very much

I was beyond excited when I saw these So I showed my supports and made the purchase The colors on the shoes in person are very vivid They look exactly like the picture and the quality of the shoe is no different then any other superstar They fit great and I get compliments out and about with them I bought the entire set and it is compliments everything well

Perfect size fit everything It matches well too

I love how comfortable the shoes are I got mine with my name on the side and it came perfect I love these shoes

It is wonderful and cool and reasonable price I am very happy with them I would recommend them

Run a tad too big have to double sock But I am happy with the price and quality of the shoe

Love the shoes The design is amazing People just talk about it everyday

I love these shoes I love the paint graphic on them I break necks everywhere i go with them on

Like all Adidas shoes they are very uncomfortable Most 3 hours before they hurt arches

Ordered a size 7 5 what got was 3 sizes bigger than that

I wear a size 17 and it is hard to find shoes that fit and I have not found any that fit better then these

they are great shoes and very comfortable i totally recommend these shoes to everyone also they are very LIT to wear lol

I am a shell toe adidas fan so already loved them before I got them but was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the insole it was different from other adidas originals

Simple and attractive that is all I can say thank you

I loves these It looks like I have been stomping on art canvases

Probably my favorite pair of shoes in my closet Very comfortable and very nice looking Not too expensive and they run true to size This shoe deserves more recognition

I loved them and I am proud of adidas showing its support to the LGBTQ Community

I saw these online last month for Pride and being a member of the LGBTQ community I thought this was awesome of Adidas to support us I instantly fell in love My color choice was perfect The colors stand out with the all black have not worn them yet Saving them for White party here in Miami

I took the white ones with me to Cuba I bought both colors I had 5 people offer to buy or barter for them off my feet

They are great they match everything I would definitely buy another pair in different color and size

Classic shoe

totally AWESOME shoes These are rad get loads of compliments and are simply awesome

Is very beautiful the price is right it is better if have more discount

Love the shoes Awesome Fit great look great Happy I bought them

The Adidas Superstar II has a lot of very good points However some may think that they are a bit toned down in terms of style here is the adviceif you are looking for a good pair of casual shoes that goes best with your jeans khakis and shorts these are going to be the best choice for you

These are great In the late 70and early 80I always had these I very happy that i can get these again and that they are back in Great style and comfort

Got it custom with my name on it Looks awesome Love the shoes

  and colors

This is a must have classic in your closet for any sneaker lover They are very casual and pretty much go with anything

exactly what i wanted good fit and comfortable i love showing my pride

Love the product because Adidas provides a great fit and comfort in there shoes

I am a size 6 6 1 2 but for sneakers I usually wear a size 7 or EU 38 based on my other sneakers because I want to have ample space for socks and my foot I read most of the reviews here and on other websites selling this particular sneakers before ordering that the sizes are larger so you have to go down 1 2 1 than your actual shoe size I ordered a size 5 5 based on reviews I based it on the EU sizing on this website since EU 38 is US 6 5 so I went 1 size down to 5 5 The shoes are an exact fit I think a thin socks can fit but if you want ample space for your foot like I do maybe just go down 1 2 a size and not 1 full size down if you are going to use the EU sizing as your reference I guess if you want the shoes to be an exact fit go down a full size but if you still want ample space just go down 1 2 a size it really depends on your preference again I used the EU sizing as my reference

I really love these shoes They are very comfortable a little big so if you have a smaller or thinner foot go half size down but they feel good to me because I have wide feet I get tons of compliments when I wear them colors pop much more in person too

My husband loves his shoes I bought them for his birthday

I am a size 5 5 in womensuperstars and ordered a 4 5 in menFits wonderfully Colors are really unique and vibrant So glad I got the white with black stripes before it ran out of small sizes Love love love and will be rocking these kicks the whole pride month

They are comfy and the colors are amazing I get great compliments I think the size has extra room in the toe pocket so if you are between sizes go down by a half size

Love the design and the fit is great as usual with Superstars

A shoe that lives up to the Adidas reputation I received these just days before the Orlando tragedy I have never had shoes worn with more significance and pride They are a grest quality and now serve a purpose as well

I love the LGBT design The shoe is beautiful I received a ton of compliments on it I went a full size down I am normally a 5 and went with a 4 and they fit perfectly with and without socks

Only shoe I will wear as they are perfect comfortable wear well and are priced right

Wow These are beautiful My daughter loved them The perfect birthday gift I love all the bright colors The fit was perfect there very comfort

Most of tennis shoes are adidas especially the superstar it is been with me since college days Besides this is just a gift for my brother I know I am giving him a good pair

Its the most head turner shoes ever And it is comfortable too

Awesome I am in love with these shoes I will wear them in the Pride

I love these shoes Pretty colorful comfortable and very original

Love superstar period The gold is nice and shiny for the supper

I install floor covering it is the only shoes i have used that the toe does not wear out they last 4 times longer than other shoes or boots please keep making them

Yes The shoes looks great more that in the picture i like them so much thanks Adidas

These shoes are hella comfortable even for people with wide feet like me

I like the way it looks and I think to buy the white ones in the future

I have been searching for these shoes for almost two years in every store and I could not find them anywhere Finally for my birthday I got a prepaid visa and I immediately went online to buy these shoes I was very nervous because I would not try them on but I was very excited

very ice product and the design dope art is love and i love the shoe

A fun and creative twist to a classic sneaker I absolutely love it I wish they made them in womensizes Luckily I am able to fit into the smallest available mensize

I like this product because it looks nice and it got me tons of compliments

I got one for my girl and other for myself now we matchD She loves it as well You cant go wrong with Adidas

Really like the look and style Comfortable and reasonably priced

I am extremely happy that Adidas has are issued these sneakerseven though the price is higher than when they were introduced last year However I wanted them so badly that I immediately snatched them up when I received email notification that they were back in stock My only issue is that they are a smidge too big but going a size down would have been too tight Also after wearing them for about 6 hours the tongue became slightly uncomfortable For some reason each style of the Superstar runs differently This is the 4th pair I own and none of them are the same size

I love this product because the colors make it different You can wear any color with these shoes It stamds out

Why you like the product or why notI like the style and design It could use an upgrade on the way it fits the heel slips out The fit is a bit narrow and the outsole could have more cushioning Although it is a great style shoe and I like them very much I will not be able to wear this shoes for more than 3 hours They could be lighter softer and more cushioned

my best newest favorite on my collection Get lots of compliments on them So comfy just how adidas originals is known for On superstars women shoes I am 1 size down 7 1 2 to 6 1 2 and Since its mens size We had to go 1 and half size more 6 1 2 to 5

Comfortable and they last forever

These kicks look even better in real life than they do on the web Fresh as it gets

I absolutely love the snickers my feet constantly heart and these are so comfortable They do run a half size small and what is nice is that I can wear them with or without socks absolutely perfect I get compliments on them all the time I am so glad I got the LGBT version

These are the cutest freaking casual shoes ever made I fell in love with them last year but missed the boat on ordering I tried on the web to find them for a year and finally got my very own from Adidas last week I feel like a sporty Cinderella

I have been wearing adidas shoes and clothing for as long as I can remember Some of my sneakers are now close to 50 years old So I did not need new ones but did want a way to show solidaity with the LGBTQ community The way these shoes were designed is perfectnot over the top with rainbow stripes but the splashes of paint A VERY cool way to get the point across SuperStars are ubiquitous and I love them

I like them because they are cool and comfortable I like How they suit me and How they are

Worn one day had 3 compliments Great looking shoe

Im a huge fan of the Jeremy Scott collection but this ones are just incredible

They match with pretty much everything and they are super comfy

They are just perfect Perfect for a casual look or something more dressy with and edge

I love my new adidas I am a woman and It was so hard to find my size in womens i had to order mens i am usually 5 5 6 i ordered 4 in mens and they fit perfectly They are so comfy I am never taking them off Best birthday gift ever Pin womens i was advised to get a 5 but they didnt have it they do run big so concider that

This is amazing I love these shoes I show so much pride with them I also love the new LGBT pants

I have been buying these shoes for about 10 years now without any issues until I purchased my last 2 pairs A pair of the Superstars would typically last me about a year before they would need replacing The last 2 pairs I purchased fell apart too quickly The first pair the toe shell started to separate from the leather after only about 2 3 weeks so I returned them The second pair lasted longer but not as long as expected again the toe shell is separating from the leather and after only about 5 months of wearing them the rubber soles are worn and have flattened I am not happy with the current quality of the shoe the quality is definitely not what is used to be

I regrate buying the customized superstar i bought 2 pairs and after 4 months of regular use the adidas logo print in the back part it is disapearing a shame for an adidas product

first they look great but they are also well made and comfortable I recommend these to anyone with a yearning to look good and feel good as you enjoy your days out

Great shoe Bought my second pair today Will buy more in that future

It is great for daily wear and looks awesome too These are the classics of classic Very comfortable and reliable

Shoes are very fashionable can be casual with any clothing and will not fall behind the trend In China a few years ago has been very popular and that time in the school can not afford to buy so expensive so good shoes and now to participate in the work to learn the overseas shopping So be sure to buy your favorite shoes when it is to realize their dreams In fact the trend is not stopped in the cycle of fashion So this is a pair of good shoes

I would suggest going a size down the first time I ordered they were to big I returned my normal size ones and ordered another pair a 1 2 size down like everyone else said They fit great now I would totally recommend

I have an older pair of superstars and they are very uncomfortable I only wore them a few times and they have been in the box Wish I could send them back and get a new pair like these I just bought

I got these shoes for my birthday and i do love them and they are pretty comfortable now that they are broken in some I only wear Adidas skater style shoes when i am not working have been a loyal customer for 16 years and Addidas has always been a great shoe and they still are i love them But the last 5 years or so i cant seem to find a wide addidas shoe or a well cushioned shoe like they used to have years ago I remember having a pair of campus skater style shoes that were so comfortable it was like walking on a cloud with a nice wide base and a thick padded tongue man do i miss those shoes every shoe now feels too narrow and they all fit snuggly on my feet with almost no cushion which is not a real bad thing and makes running in them easier and i guess that is the style now days but i do not wear my Addidas superstar or campus sneakers for sport they are my leisure shoes i want to feel like i am walking on a cloud so to speak ill keep buying them because i love the brand and the quality but i will be waiting for the day when a wide and well cushioned skater style shoe comes back in style please do not make me switch brands them DCare starting to look mighty comfy

Everyone likes them but they are slightly uncomfortable especially around the tongue

Perfect love it i need a coupon to buy another pair i want a customs one Great great shoes

I love my sneakers They fit a little big but overall they are perfect Super comfortable also My husband and I each bright a pair to wear it in our honeymoon trip We are very satisfied Thank you Addidas

I am a girl and I wanted them customized but I guess they only customize boys shoes so I bought it in a boys size if you do this make sure you get one size below your regular size and they might be a little wide Other than that they are insanely comfortable and I love them

They run pretty big so I suggest going to a store to purchase them

I bought them half size more than mine because my feet are a bit wide and usually than helps a lot but these shoes are juts made width so do not recommend them for people with wide feet

they are amazing and I got them in 2 days Love it

I new they were going to look great but when I inboxed my adidas superstars the were amazing Better than I expected

Shoe looks great well put together and stylish I am normally a 9 5 wide if I can find a wide size but I wanted to get Adidas Originals classic style I ordered a 10 thinking that might be enough room but a 10 is VERY tight squeeze across the toe for a person with a 9 5 size foot Hoping a 10 5 will work for me but I would advise anyone who does not already have a narrower than average foot to size up a lot I am a fogey who remembers when these shoes came out so perhaps the young generation has smaller feet due to less nutrients in the diet these days

Good shoes i was expecting that from adidas shoes I can wear with pretty much everything

the shoe is what I expected wear an size 4 1 2 in vans and I thought an 4 1 2 in these will be an little too big so I order an size 4 and they fit perfectly fine

They were not tight easy to get on everyone should have these I might buy a lot more of these great job adidas

It hurts my toes when I walk and they are very narrow

I love my adidas shell toe shoes Delivery was quick and prompt Overall happy with my shoes

My girlfriend and I both like adidas so I bought two pairs of adidas shoes I like the superstar shoes which is perfect but I very disappointed with the quality of The mi star shoes The mi star shoes looks like a counterfeit product I think I will never buy the mi star shoes again

I have been wearing the superstars for years They are awesome My wife makes fun of me because if a pair begins to wear out I instantly need to replace it She thinks I should branch out for more diversity No need comfortable good looking last a long time What more could you need

I love those shoes They fit well are really comfortable and look great on feet

these are great classic shoes that need more attention in the sneaker community ive been wearing these since they came out i love them there awsome

I bought the gold shoe and it looks exactly like the picture Very dope shoe

I love this shoes but are some what slippery

it is hard finding my size in the womensection and I have checked many stores to see if they have mine I have been disappointed over and over I decided to get my equivalent in the menbecause why not and I have been doing it pretty much all my life anyway huhu I tried out a size at a store that only had the other colors and ordered it online The fitting is way different from what I tried on at a store What I received were a bit looser than the perfect Cinderella fit back at the store I checked No matter I believe it is better this way since I tend to switch over from really thin to normal thick socks and it would be almost snug it is such a beautiful pair that I am thinking of getting another Because why not

Comfortable with the classic look to it Nice for playing running and just styling out after

Unique style and color i was looking for adidas country

I love this shoe it is comfortable looks great I do recommend going a half size down I had to exchange and still could have gone a half size down more the area around the ankle is a bit loose but overall great for just wearing with casual clothes I would not recommend these for any sport

My second pair of supertar You never go wrong with this classic sneaker I love it

Absolutely love them been getting tons of compliments I got the grey silverish color and will be getting the black ones too only a half size down

I must say to person to owns a lot of shoes this one is my favorite ever Great style and super comfortable I have been suffering from plantar fascitis for while and this shoes is so comfortable do not make my pain worse I love so much I got the silver one also

such a great shoe 10 10 would definitely recommend

The silver looks even better in person and they are comfortable as all superstarare Love them

Ordered shoes got here in four days son was very happy about the shoes

This shoe is timeless af The design is so cool

They run a 1 2 size bigger but they are awesome Got them for me my daughter and wife

This picture of four pairs of superstar shows my life with Adidas So many memories of my life thanks

Not sure what the other complaints are about I absolutely love the silver on these shoes

Dope and stylish shoes Gonna order a red RT in a bit

Since these are mens and I am female I ordered one size down as recommended They fit perfectly I wanted to try Adidas again after all these years because I read they were VERY comfortable unlike Converse and that they had good arch support Both statements are completely true I am pleasantly surprised with how comfortable these sneakers are I purchased another pair in a different style ladies and they feel like slippers

I have had about 5 pairs of Superstars over the years and the 2 most recent were very poor quality Most recent pair the upper pulled away from the sole in less than a year

I bought it fot my bf and personalized his name on the shoes he is really appreciated I also have mine too TBH Adidas superstar will never die So classic And go with every outfit we have

Never really thought about wearing shell toe Adidas before until I brought my toddler some so I order me a pair so we could wear together And man this shoe is like walking on a cloud Very comfortable and cute

I am very shocked that this superstar shell toe was horrible online it is a great show then it come to you and you have a chewing gum wrapper finish and flat face it was a immediate return

I just got these shoes in December but the fronts of both the right and left shoe are already coming apart I do not even wear these shoes everyday I am a big fan of Adidas but I probably will not be buying any of their cheaper shoes anymore

Yeezy Yeezy Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman

I have been wearing Stan Smith shoes on the tennis court since High School 1976 1979 They are just as good now as always Seem to be a little narrow this time but that may be my year old feet

They are great super comfortable but I had to get it in a size down and the laces are a bit to long but both of those things are easy fixes Great shoes though

Fast shipping And they are exactly what I wanted Had to return twice bc I did not know my size since these rare men but it was not complicated

fits perfect and so comfy will not regret this purchase

I love these shoes so much but they are kind of stiff and do not break in well Also they run really large I am usually a size 6 and I ordered a size 4 5 and they are still a little too big

The only shoes I wear

My Adidas That song is from my era Ok the adidas are great Just like I remember them to be back in 88 I am so old school I am now 45 and can still rock these as an adult

Nice and they are sexy also Its one of the best adidas I ever buy before I I will buy it again again cuz they are nice

When I first saw that the SUPERSTAR is back I instantly decided to buy it because it brought back memories since it stopped being produced for almost 10 years now The SUPERSTAR is absolutely amazing to wear at any given occasion because it simply combines class and casual taste together Henceforth making it a joker all around player when it comes to dressing up However the problem that I found really annoying is the feeling while wearing the shoes on Firstly it is size is a very small bit off making it hard to find the right size Furthermore the problem that really gives me a hard time is that wearing the shoes makes my Medial Longitudinal Arch or the middle arch of my foot from the bottom hurts a lot due to the fact that the shoe is very hard in this area giving an uncomfortable feeling while wearing it Needs to be fixed in future productions

Dope kicks always changin colors get hella compliments but tounge lil stiff

I bought a size 10 1 2 and they fit me I love these shoes I wear them at least three times a week As a matter of fact I have to go get me to move here Thanks for the great experience

i like it but i want to personalize the shoes with my name

you just give me a wrong size although that is 10 size on the box but the shoes are 11

My white superstar fits for all kinds of occasion If you are an adidas lover having a pair of this is a must

These Superstars fit perfectly and look so fly I am never let down by Adidas quality looks fit or price Adidas rocks as usual

Amazing shoes I loved them the first time that i saw them

This shoe will never go out of style Superstars have a timeless look not to mention a comfortable fit

Worth the money

So glad these shoes are back I bought these for my husband and he loves them The only complaint I have is when I opened the box to check them out I noticed that both pairs had dirt smudges on them Luckily they wiped clean but I was surprised they left the factory like that

Does anyone know how to customize them on here

Good work shoe

The shoe fits perfect love the shoe with the gold ascents it makes it even better Shipping was perfect came earlier than expected which is always something better

Shellies are the greatest

Love my sneakers

Spectacular quality on these shoes I have never seen shoes made this good

I was very excited to get my Superstar all black with with stripes Originals I am very disappointed Not leather Only small patches were used I sent them back I am going to have some custom made If they are not all leather like the Originals good by for good

What could you ask for

but I love them

I got these as a gift to my boyfriend and he is in love with these The color changes are game changing A lot of people sleep on Adidas but these are the rawest mind blowing pair of shoes I have ever seen Can they make a womansize PLEASE

Just got them in the mail today and they are sweet

Color way and shoe is just excellent

Great product very comfortable

good

This show feels great on your feet and its colors pop

Go back to the old design These things are ugly now i need to look for another shoe

I ordered these shoes as a Christmas gift my daughter who has large feet she can wear a mensize 8 5 The length is perfect but the width is too narrow She loves the look style and quality of these shoes and is very disappointed they do not fit

I am a girl and was not able to find the womensuperstars anywhere Luckily enough I was able to purchase these in a small enough mensize so they would fit me I am a 9 or 9 1 2 in womenso I ordered a 7 in mendue to all of the suggestions to size down by half of a size I am glad I did because these fit me well Because of the smaller size these look identical to the womenshoe I have seen online The only little thing I can say is that they open a little wide around the ankle but it is hardly an issue The shoes arrived very quickly and are great quality

They were a Christmas present I added his name and basketball number on 1 shoe and a Bible verse on the other He loved it

My daughter loves her new adidas

First time purchasing a pair of adidas They are a bit comfortable but yet they seemed to creased fairly fast Even when purposely trying to walk so that they will not

This was really perfect and i got complimented a lot Buy the clear aqua one Its dope in 3D

I love them so much I am buying a second pair

I totally love them Lots of people stop me and tell that my shoes are glowing and how cool they are

The best shoe anyone has ever made in the history of shoes First of all its comfortable second of all its so amazing that every time i wear them at least 7 8 ppl tells me how cool they are i have 8 pairs of originals but these are my favorite ones i really next summer they will release them again olt 3

I have been buying and wearing these sneakers for over 15 years Comfortable durable stylish I just love them Recently been harder to find them in my size I really hope they are not being phased out of production Next time I see my size available gonna probably buy 10 pairs to be safe

These shoes are easy to get on and off they stay tied during the day and are easy to clean at the end of the day I have owned these shoes for a few months now and have been able to keep them in great condition

As soon as I got these shoes on I immediately felt that the size was perfect and that I got my moneyworth as I thought they were extremely comfortable and the product itself is worth it

I have recently purchased these sneakers and i love the them I have had my eye on them for about a month and i finally got them and i am not disappointed at all they just as i pictured the only fault is that they are a little bit narrow but overall a great sneaker with out question

I do not do anything other than walk with theseno basketball running hiking whatever The shoes should not be falling apart within a year of having them The inside lining rips open and the seams that connects the midsole and v and rip open from normal wear and tear in 7 8 months At 12 months the lining has fallen apart to the point where the plastic in the shoe is visible This was my 2nd pair where the same thing has happened will never by these again Other sneakers from other companies have held up much better

Size runs a half bigger

these shoes are the most comfortabole stylish shoes i own LOVE THEM

It is a very nice shoe I have been getting allot of compliments about it but the only problem is that after 3 weeks of wearing it the scales were cracked Other then that a great shoe

I am normally a size 7 in women I thought that these would run big so I went down half a size Since this is in mensizing I ordered a size 5 Women6 5 and they were slightly small I think that a size 5 5 which is my true size in menwould fit perfect These do not run big like the normal superstars do so I recommend getting your normal size Other than that they look amazing and I am in love with them Shipping was insanely fast and I received the shoes in record time

I have been buying and wearing the Superstars for over 20 years and the latest pair I just received is not what I am used to in regards to overall quality Poor much lower quality overall construction including the inside of the shoe The shell toe itself seems to be unchanged which is a good thing

I love the shoes but they fit way smaller than other Adidas shoes I wear Sambas comfortably in a 12 5 and these Superstars are a little large for me even in a 12 I had to buy 11 5s and they feel a little too narrow

having been getting the superstar 2s for the last few years this change was not needed the shoe looks the same but has become cheap i would pay 20 more to have that old quality back

I bought these in a size 6 5 mens normally a 7 5 8 womens and they were too big I have to reorder them and try a 6 disappointing because the suggestion was to buy a 5 size down from your normal size but they were still to large

I purchased the black version and received it today I took the advice of the reviewers and got a 1 2 size smaller and that worked perfectly When you first open the box these shoes pop They are very cool looking there are two distinct patterns look at the left side and look at the right side I like that they are dark almost black looking in general For example if you are outside in the sunlight the shoe appears to be a dark charcoal colored shoe Thus you can wear just about anything It is when you are inside that different light can really show the colors Any flash the color scales go white Very cool The shoe is comfortable and definitely unique

well i needed a 12 5 but at that size they only have them in 12 13 and 14 i got them in 13 and they fit fine a little big but better than a 12 which i can not wear they do look black or a greenish tone but you will notice that they do change colors when the sunlight hits them or whenever a flash is taken i do notice that in certain situations they go from black normally to white when the flash is taken aside from the black 3 stripes not sure if they did this on purpose or not but it is very cool looking i would say they are kind of like the box that they come in where it mixes every color at once on the 3 stripes kind of like the strip on the front of a mastercard where it bounces every color at you depending on where the light is coming from normally you will get a lot of dark green purple depending on the light take them out in the daylight and you will see more or indoors depending on the light i would definitely recommend these for anyone who is into shoes

I love these shoes I was looking for them for quite a while and finally found out that the kids size fit These shoes run super big I usually wear a size 8 in women and the size 6 for kids fit just perfect even the 5 would have work but I prefer using socks Definitely go down two sizes or you will be disappointed

I always get the right stuff and quick delivery Very easy to navigate website and no issues placing orders

1st superstar great shoes The color changing is just something that people ask me about They are really cool

After only having the shoes for a couple of months there is a tear on one of the shoes where the shell toe and the shoe laces meet on the pinky side So everytime I take a step there is an ugly gap it is too bad because I love everything else about the shoe they have got the silhouette I prefer and they are comfortable But I can not give it a good review if it starts to rip apart just a couple months of after getting them

Good basic shoe fits well comfortable and great for walking Like the solid leather warmer than mesh

as expected from adidas superstar fits well looks good

I have been eyeing these shoes for a while now and finally took the leap They are the perfect addition to any outfit to give you a sporty look They can be dressed up or down according to your liking as well They do run a bit large though so make sure you order your correct size For example ladies if you are a US size 8 just like me order these in menUS size 6 5 They fit me perfectly

These shoes are amazing but the size does differ from other superstars that I own Bought them for my wife as well as myself and we both had to get smaller sizes As for some of the other reviewers they are reflective so they are only going to change color when there a light shining on then which you can see in the video and it says so in the description We got them in both colors I would say the black is definitely better than the grey

I bough these sneakers for my daughter and it seems like the crease between the shelltop and side of sneaker is already splitting I have heard about this happening before to plenty of people but I did not think this would happen so soon being that this sneakers hardly been worn She owned these sneakers less than a month I will not buy any shelltops from adidas never

super brill product I love it

I bought these shoes not to long ago and the shell toe part of the shoe is not glued properly Has a hole in the side of the shell toe

They run 5 size big

My son Loves the shoes They are just a bit too big

I keep buying the same shoes over 15 yrs I have worn adidas superstars best shoes ever however I do not care for the gold accents on the new ones

Love my new Clam Shells as I always called them 30 plus years dealing with My Adidas Great personal touch when they offered personalized to your liking Thanks

I am fifty years young and I am still Rockin them with my Levis outfit WhatWhatlol Guudstuff

 Approved

My husband is a huge fan of the original Italia However since bringing these home for him last week he wears nothing else We paid his mother a visit and she immediately noticed and complimented them We love the way they look and husband loves the way they feel Great shoes

 Women shoppers should order two sizes down than what they normally wear because this product is in mensizing

Adidas superstar very beautiful and classic shoes

Love my Superstars bought an extra pair Great for work play everything

The shoe is very comfortable and is easy to slip on and off but the materials are cheap The coated leather the upper is made of is laminated leather that looks fake I personally prefer the durable full grain leather of the Samba Classics The part of the shoe where you bend your foot gets creased and crinkled very easily and stays that way Since the leather is coated in plastic the shoe does not breathe at all I feel that these shoes will not last more than a year with continuous wear The gold label on the tongue is also a little much The shoe is still the classic Superstar silhouette if that counts for anything Ever since the Superstar line expanded to all of these weird colors and materials I feel that the quality has declined to save on cost As you may have guessed I support the Samba Classics as a cheaper but more durable alternative Thank you

These superstars feature a lighter shell toe and a cushioned footbed 2 perfect updates for an already great shoe And the snakeskin pattern gets a ton of complements

I have had the all white superstars for almost a year now and just purchased the all black pair and am in love with them fully recommended

Been a loyal adidas fan since I was in 10 years old 25 now over that span I have owned 4 pairs of Superstars one of which being the original Superstar Inow defunct why is thatBought another pair and I guess they rebranded the 2as Superstar FoundationsThey fit a bit bigger than my last pair the laces ARE thinner and where are the lace locksadidas WHY do you keep on trying to reinvent the circleWhy mess with the classicsIf it are not broke do not fix it and the SUPERSTAR 2did not even need any repair nor did the 1Please bring back the ORIGINAL 1the 2and the 2GKeep your Originals original

I GOT THESE BECAUSE ALI FROM FOUSEYTUBE DOSEOFFOUSEY HAS THEM AND THEY DIDNT DISAPPOINT

This shoe is nice i would still wear it however it is a catfish i expected the colors to be bright 24 7 and the really only show when you have them under the light of your phone True definition of a catfish they look nice and beautiful online and in person they just alright just know when you get them they will be black 98 of the time even in sunlight you get just a hint of green

These shoes are the bomb it is really unique and eyes catching I own other superstar pairs and I wear them in size 10 but once I got the xeno one I wore them and they were too large for me So I returned them and ordered half down the size 9 5 and hopefully it will be good Otherwise the materials they used for this shoe are very decent

I love my shoes They were 1 2 size to big but that is okay Cant stop wearing them really comfortable

They are a little more narrow then my other adidas but I can live with it cause I have wanted them for a while now

have worn this shoe exclusively for the past ten years regardless of trends I stayed with this style I am giving up the style because you added superstarin gold on the side

The design of the shoe looks legit One thing that I do not like about it is that whenever I walk my top of my foot hurts very badly I think it is because the toe part of the shoe is made out of hard material I was going to return it and get a new one but I already wore it so I guess I will have to deal with it

These shoes are amazing and very tumblr I have wore them a couple times already and I have not had to clean them at all xx

i like wearing addias they are comfortable

According to the size chart a mensize 8 is equal to a womansize 9 but the shoe is slightly too big for me Other than this sizing issue the effects of the xeno are amazing and the snake skin pattern is perfect

My Superstars are a perfect accessory to my casual or laid back sporty look just like back in the late 80 

The product is exactly the one I did expect

Comfortable love the outer leather and I like that I was able to customize it Most of all I thank you for the quick delivery

I had to return but waiting on an exchange option with a width wider

Love them Always wanted a pair back in the day Great quality and tread Good arch support Heel area was a little loose but some lace adjustments and it is all good now

It is classical Nice looking and comfortable Maybe I will get more for my family menbers

Love these shoes Always wanted them in all black because I am not too fond of all white eggshell adidas I stand out everywhere I go with my funky fly new kicks

If you want a shoe that shines bright and looks sick in anylight I would recommend this show it is shoe cool in person also if fits perfect

I am a size 10 normally and I ordered a size 9 because it says to order a size down I really need an 8 5 because when I walk my foot slips out of the shoe no mattter how tight I tie the laces I need a different size but I do not want to spend money to ship them back I also have flat feet and the shoes have a huge arch that pushes at the bottom of my foot and it is very painful I would say order a size down definitely and in my case a size and a half down

Shoes came out exactly how I wanted them to Unfortunately about a week and a half after purchasing a letter on each shoe fell off Other then that they have been decent shoes

it is really important that I get 12 1 2it makes all the difference

The pictures do not do the shoe justice They are amazing and my favorite pair of shoes Thanks Adidas for supporting the LGBT community

Colors are even brighter than they appear in the pictures I have gotten stopped multiple times by people complementing these sneakers very happy with the purchase

Thanks Adidas Love them

nice and classic shoe

These shoes are pretty comfortable and the look and the pride behind the shoe are awesome I am enjoying them a lot and wear them for casual wear Real nice TY

The sneakers are excellent and the pride colors and statement from adidas is amazing Working at SiriusXM for the Out network I wear my sneakers to office and everyoneall a buzz to buy them

The Three Stripe Pride shoes are awesome They are very comfortable and the graphic design is done very well Very impressed LOVE them Proud to wear them to SFPride this weekend

I have now owned 5 pairs of superstars they are comfortable hold up all day and have a classic look I was a little scared for a minute as they were getting hard to find in my area but it looks like adidas just wanted to do a little relaunch Love these and cannot recommend enough

I was really excited for these shoes until I realized the colors only come out on the flash of a camera And the snake print comes out weird White rubber toe looks weird Not what I expected

These shoes are truly stunning in person very vibrant colorful and unique but most of all high quality The shoes are comfortable with good insoles I am very satisfied and content with my purchase After getting my shipment I decided to buy another pair Adidas did a wonderful job with the design of the shoes Order yours while they are still available I noticed after a week sizes are becoming limited

These shoes show my pride while I am at work at home and out and about I get tons of compliments on my new Adidas shoes nearly every day Gorgeous colors

Now on to the Superstar Xeno I must say Adidas had me in such a humble adoration that I had a huge grin on my face ear to ear Right out of the box the shoe began to show its colors and they were jaw dropping to me So after playing with them forever I used my iPhone for the flash to see them in their full 3M effect and continued to be amazed like a child lol Afterward I put them on my wide feet and they are comfortable as well I have not one complaint on any aspect of this particular Xeno

These definitely are the best shoes I have ever purchased in a while The colors are vibrant the shoe itself is very well made and comfortable The cause behind these shoes are meaningful and beautiful there is literally nothing I do not like about my shoes I just want to walk around and dance in circles in them all day long It will be even better if they come in smaller sizes

i like wearing addias most comfortable shoe to wear

These shoes are so much better in person I could only buy these shoes online and I lucked out by getting the perfect size on the first try lol Thank you Adidas for supporting the LGBT community and creating these awesome shoes

Adidas super star simple a classic shoe for awsomeness

I just purchased my first shell toe addidas Addidas Superstar White Blk stripeds never imagined how comfortable they are HOWEVER you should offer this particular shoe year around with the capabilites of allowing to customize the stripes your custom process is limited I would own a multitued of colors if i was able to select any color for my stripes so i that i can coordinate with outfits not everyone likes the all colorful sometimes simple bright white with color stripes can make staple statement when wearing them

I bought a pair of these in February and I have hardly taken them off since They have become my thing among my friends I purchased the classic white and black and despite the gold details they go great with everything They were extremely comfortable from the first time I put them on They did not require any breaking in The fit was great other than that I had to lace up the very top hole and I have to retie them throughout the day to keep my heel from slipping out when I walk This is probably because I wear a women8 5 9 and this is a menshoe however They breathe well and my feet do not get too hot wearing them Really comfortable to walk around in all day I am looking forward to buying more in the future

I have been using the Superstarand the Sambaas my go to shoes since high school 2000 on and I still love them The fit has changed slightly over the years to add in some additional inner arch support on these which makes the inner insert feel like it is cradling my feet but I do not mind it Depending on how your arch rests this might be slightly agitating since it could feel like the shoe is not fitting right and also make you feel like there is something in your shoe where the insert and shoes side wall meet I had this problem but quickly got used to it

When I found out adidas was dropping the 2G I bought the last three pair in existence in size US 12 in navy and white The original Superstar is flimsy I bought an all black pair and does not even come close to the support of the 2G Wake up adidasbring back the 2G

Is not my first pair of Superstar so I know how good they are I will keep using them

I am a nurse and searched for shoes that would hold up and keep me comfy for 12 hours These shoes do just that and more Men and women complement me on how cool they look and ask where I got them I bought a second pair to wear outside of work Please do not ever discontinue them or stop the color combos

Girls order 1 and a half size down or 2 sizes down

This shoe is perfectly designed for looks and for comfort I am looking forward to be buying many more adidas based shoes because of the great style and once again and the great comfort

Adidas may have made a couple of fashion tweaks to it but this is the same superstar that people have loved I wish they left the logo on the tongue white but the shoe still looks good it is still a very comfortable shoe

Bought these in black and noticed they are narrower than the last pair I had I prefer the superstars to have the wider toe area Also liked it when the Adidas logo was in white on the tongue

To find the proper words it is difficult but this tenis always ar xc3 xa9 gooing to be the best of all times

Shoes were for daughterbirthday and she loves them

I love my shoes they are the best shoes the size is right and they are the color that is on the website I can not wait to get another pair I think the next time I will get the white with black stripes size 13 superstars adidas is a great company

Ordered them late Saturday night had them by Tuesday morning Excellent product and service Im not one to spend alot on shoes but every pair of Addias i have owned have always lasted 2 3 years which is awesome considering what i put them threw I ordered them with a company name on the side and now my coworkers all want a pair Will definetly buy here again

I normally wear a Men9 1 2 10 in sneakers and these SUPERSTARs were too long I went down a half size to 9 1 2 because I have some SUPERSTAR 2G that are a 10 mens and they fit fine but these were way too long My heel was coming out of the back of the 9 1 2s

thought I was buying leather shoes only a very small part from the first stripe to the toe and the part the strings go in is leather the rest is cheap vinyl or something that does not bend well or break in

Hubby so excited to finally get these and we have to return They are cheaply put together and look like plastic not even a good fake leather look

I like my shoes

do not like

I absolutely LOVE these sneakers The are the most comfortable pair I own

These shoes fit me just right and go with my jeans just how I like it

I am in love with my superstars I will buy these shoes until the day I die

I purchased 3 pairs they are awesome Fit very well since i have small feet 6 5 fits me perfectly I used to never like Adidas but after buying them they feel really comfortable when wear and look awesome on

These are exactly what I was looking for A classic with a new twist

I have been wanting these trainers for well over a year now and I finally got them but not from the site nor the adidas store itself they seemed genuine and perfect also the numbers on the tag were not identical and the box was oringal but the two layers of the back of my pair were a bit sloppy and they do not look attractive at all but in these photos they are very well precise cutting involved any helpful tips on what I should do about them

I bought these tennis to use everyday it is sturdy and very hip I am in love with this shoes

The toe cap is falling off

I am Adidas lover

BUY IT

it is great and I love it

go and try it on in the store

I really love SuperStar Design

Extremely comfortable shoes looking to cop the white ones

My usual size is 9 5 and I got a 9 5 of these superstars I would say that it is quite big in fact it is bigger than all of my 9 5 shoes

I love the design and material It looks nice with any clothes

Super excited when I got these in the mail But I sadly had to return them because they were a half size too big I am a size 10 in womenand usually that is a 8 5 in menBut on this website the conversion is different stating that I am a 9 in menI never had a pair of Adidas before so I trusted the size chart When I finally tried the shoes on it felt slightly loose and my heels would pick up So in the end I had to return them and buy a half size smaller at my local mall But now I am loving my new shoes and I would totally recommend them to others

I typically wear a size 7 mens for sneakers but the 7s were a bit too big I wear an 8 5 in womenI exchanged for the 6 5 and they were perfect Really great cushioning on the insoles and super comfortable for every day wear I really like the modern shell toe a little more subtle They are iconic and definitely more fashion than some of the other sneakers I wear I always get compliments on them no matter what I wear them with

The shoe speaks for its self

Why do not have smaller size only big one

So classic shoes

The new superstar is worth every penny look fabulous wear great Stimy

My brand fav adidas i love it my fav adidas original

Have owned Superstars before and was satisfied however this pair was not up to my standards

You can not go wrong with this classic This shoe goes with everything and is comfortable Takes me back to my childhood in the Bronx

I want women shoes sizes

it is the perfect shoe classic and modern sporty and elegant simple and complicated You can wear it anytime and anywhere Well done adidas

Comfort style and class rolled into one A must have for any Nike lover

Looks cool but they crease weird and are less comfortable that a lot of other shoes

Once I got these sneakers I was little skeptical about the way they would fit But after wearing them for a 13 hour shift I was greatly surprised They were very comfortable and provided excellent ankle support The style and comfort made this shoe an easy pick up These by far the best basketball sneakers I have purchased well worth the money I am actually looking at getting another pair

Bought these shoes for my 12 year old son and he loves them

Really great shoe i need cleaning products for the material though but other than that im really happy with my purchase

They look great but the narrow fit makes them feel so uncomfortable

Style and comfort are on point The price was pretty good also

Just got the shoe and I tried it on I do got to admit it feel REALLY comfortable and it is true to size also I am naturally wide footed and I wad kinda skeptic about buying this exactly my size but if fits perfectly These shoes pop in color so these will turn heads They look a lot better with slim or skinny jeans Overall I think these are great

You cannot sleep on these They are one good lookin shoe with high quality material it is comfortable and it is true to size so if you want a highquality comfortable food looking sneaker this is the one for you

I have to say that I was disappointed with these boots After reading all the reviews They did not live up to what I read They look good and are stylish but as for comfort They are lacking My feet hurt after a 8hr day in them I am a Nike head and a lot The Retro 9are not worth the price to me and I would not buy them again

Anyone looking for a pair of stylish winter boots should most definitely get these Looks and feels great Actually thinking of getting the brown ones too

do not usually wear Jordan but these sneaker boots are the best of the Nike translations They look great with jeans I bought the tan ones and love them

Great shoes you should probably 5 half a size down Fashionable Boots

Very Painful and can become very uncomfortable

The boot pays great homage to the past with the colorways and update to a fully functional boot Great construction and comfort you will not be disappointed But to those of us looking for a style fuctional boot to wear to work its questionable because it has reflectives all around the boot It shows up as black but as soon as a flashlight shines on it you are going to light up Thats my only gripe so i might paint over the reflective since i have 2 pairs but i was definitely looking for a all black boot

I purchased these sneakers for my husband as a Christmas gift my daughter own a few pair and said they were extremely comfortable Since they were on sale I decided to get them for an upcoming family trip to Disney that will require a lot of walking Shipping was fast and the package was packed well The sneakers run small so I recommend when ordering anyone go a half size up When he tried them on they fit perfect Very comfortable light and airy I am going to order a pair for me too

Bought in 2017 for my grandson and was tight fit so ordered 1 2 size bigger in 2018 He said they were perfect fit

Purchased these from finish line as a Christmas gift When I went to wrap them realized one shoe was filthy dirty They were supposedly new Could not wrap them up as a gift Going to have to bring them back do not know how someone could have the nerve to send these to me as a new pair of shoes that I paid good money for have not ever had a problem like this from finish line before but definitely will not order from them online again

I decided to buy these shoes because of the price that they were They are by far one of the most comfortable shoes that I have ever put on They certainly are a good buy for anyone who like a casual look and are into walking a lot

The shoe is very comfortable holds up well with daily wear Would definitely buy another pair

Fit great and are very comfortable I would recommend them to the casual wearer

I have been looking for a khaki colored shoe it seems like forever I finally found that shoe and not to mention the bargain I got Perfect size fit and of course the color love the color Great job Finish Line

The sole of my right shoe became loose very quickly and slides out of place a lot but that is about my only Complaint

Very happy with this purchase have received many compliments on how stylish they look These shoes are super light and comfortable I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable stylish shoe

The shoes are great The delivery was nice easy and very well protected It arrived on the expected date and could not really find ANY damage to the box or the shoes They are VERY comfortable and BETTER looking in person Was a good purchase

Fit great and worth every penny Recommended these for any casual wearer

These are very comfortable I can wear these all day Great for the price

These shoes are some of my favorite in my collection and while the cushion is no where near something like boost or zoom the overall lightness and materials on the shoe make it something I would definitely wear all day

This is my 2nd pair I have MS so it is hard to find shoes that fit and feel good I like this pair because they have a black sole so I wear them to work with my black dress pants and no one can tell I have on tennis shoes I am a teacher I have foot drop with my right foot so I tear the toe of the right shoe up pretty fast If I could buy two right shoes and one left I would be in good shape The only thing that bothers me in the insoles that are bumpy

I am not really the one to complain but the soles came off the second time I wore them

I bought these as my second pair Primarily purchased because they are stealth and loosely meet the business casual requirement at the job site These feel socks with a comfortable insole Personally I love them only con is the life expectancy of the soles

I needed a nice comfortable affordable stylish pair of running shoes and these were just that Very light on your feet almost feels like house shoes and for 60 You could not beat it

This is my second pair of Nike Roshe Ones Previous pair has a white outsole that is hard to keep clean I purchased the triple black pair so that dirt and scuffs will not be as noticeable Pair fits true to size and width is normal I could definitely wear these shoes all day long and have Wish I could wear them at work Great Casual shoe in my opinion

Very comfortable and lightweight I want more in different colors

Such a comfortable shoes that I can wear all day long

A great purchase

Bought these for my son and he loves them Wears them usually everyday and never any complaints

Bought for husband had black ones wanted red ones He really liked them He says they are really confortable The only thing is that when it is really cold his feet feel it because of the material but he does not mind

Bought it for my boyfriend as a gift and he loved them He already had a pair but I bought one in all black so he could wear it with more outfits He says it is pretty comfy and loves the look I got a decent deal so I am happy with it 

The shoes are awesome Sooooo comfortable an they make exercise feel good Plus they are my favorite color Red

Great shoe runs small but overall it is a pretty comfortable shoe

Good deal and are comfortable and light would recommend to work in or to work out

Love these shoessss Great buy need to get one in every color

Nike will NOT cover these shoes under warranty if they break doing anything but walking We bought a pair for our teenager Within 10 days they broke While running during basketball he stopped and his foot busted through the mesh on the front of the shoes I sent them in under warranty to Nike and they said that these shoes are only for for walking or just taking it easy and not designed for sporting activities or lateral movements such as basketball or on court use Claim DENIED

I wear these just about every day now If you are not doing much movement you can even wear them without socks and they will not cause blisters or sweat your feet too much

I bought these shoes to workout in they are great so far

Bought for my son he loves them had to buy a pair for my younger son too so now my oldest and husband want a pair too

I bought these for my husband and he loves them He loves how they fit and says they are really comfortable

Bought these for work and they feel like you are barefoot and walking on a soft rug I love them will buy some more colorways

One of my faves from Nike Will highly recommend will not disappoint

My son wanted these really bad He is very pleased with the fit and feel

I ordered this for my son He really was happy with my purchase It was exactly what he expected We will order again

First pair of roshes and will be buying more Got them cause I caught a great deal on them but they are so comfortable and stylish I will be buying more of them

These shoes are comfortable and fashionable I could wear these all day

Awesome shoe I would definitely recommend it to a friend Very reasonable price stylish comfortable to wear

I guess Finishline ships the shoes from a store and not a warehouse The soles were a bit scuffed up which is disappointing when ordering online it is a minor problem so I do not think I will return them but enough of a problem that I am writing this complaint As for the shoes they are comfortable and are my second pair I wear size 10E in dress shoes and 10 5 fit well

Great shoes My only complaints would be that they get worn down pretty easily I wear these everyday at school at home and playing pick up basketball and so the tread gets worn down quickly and the material eventually starts to rip My only other complaint is that the bottom of the shoe where your foot goes is bumpy so after an hour or so of playing some pick up basketball at the rec center it starts to hurt your feeta lot Despite the minor issues would buy again and would recommend

I have had my eye on these for a while and they we are on sale so kind of a no brainer I picked them up and I am happy with my purchase

I bought these as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old son and he loved them

Got these as a gift to my Boyfriend he loved them And I have to say so myself they look awesome and he says they are very comfortable Not to mention this price is awesome

This is a great shoe it is lightweight and comfortable to wear literally all day If your looking to dome some running be active or just for style without trying hard this is a great pick

Ready to wear daily

They run a little big But other than that I love them They are very comfortable and light

These are my new favorite shoes They are true to size and very comfortable

it is a dope sneaker I love these kicks a great pick up

Love the comfort of these shoes Easy to wear and workout in

Great for working on your feet all day Very comfortable

Bought these for casual wear light weight comfortable and stylish

Very comfortable shoes and nice to wear with pants

These shoes look great and feel good but the mesh towards the front near the toe started tearing away from the sole after a week of wear

Returned the all black sole looked sloppy with glue size was too small

They are very comfortable Love this I would definitely buy them again

These shoes are great and comfortable I would definitely recommend

These are the best pairs if you walk a lot and it also has a great style I have no regrets on this purchase Get them and you will feel the comfortable wearing these

I have several pairs of Roshe but these black pair bought two pair I wear for work We have to wear all black shoes and I noticed that people would complain after work that their feet hurt after standing for 7 hours or more Yes our job require long hours of standing mostly on hard concrete floor but I never had that problem My Roshe allows my feet to breathe and my toes to wiggle up and down This is important because it allows the circulation of blood to continue to flow through your legs

Amazing feel comfort Longevity very reliable Great style and looks I am an ER nurse and run 12 hours per shift Had a pair for almost 6 months still going strong Bought this pair of black ones for every day shoe wear Recommend to all Will buy more

I use these for work every day and these shoes are great for walking running

dope shoes period and everyone should buy a pair

Brought the all black ones for my boyfriend I also have the same sneakers for work Feels really good

My son got these shoes for casual wear and loves them He gives everything a 5 star rating That works for Mom

I most recently bought the all black Roshes and I love them They are sharp looking and go with everything I have got five pair of Roshes and intend to buy more They are the most comfortable and stylish shoes I have ever had Everyone should have at least one pair of Roshes in their arsenal

Bought these shoes for my ten year old as a present for good work at the end of the school year he was super excited for these cool new shoes and brought them with him to basketball c and to wear during off court times He has had these shoes less than a month and there is a giant rip in the fabric He was not doing anything crazy in them just normal use mostly running around outside and in the gym which one would expect a pair of Nikes to be able to handle I and he are very disappointed

I have 5 differnt colors of these all iam gonna say is they look great BUT if you have low arches avoid these they will kill your feet

This shoe is comfortable light and is reasonably priced

The purchase was easy no gemic the shoes and size was on point Was a great deal Thank you finish line can not wait to do more shipping with you

I have five different Roshes and they all have lasted me a long time especially my grey ones they seem to clean themselves over time but obviously since these are white they are going to get dirty gas but it seems like the mesh material on the white Roshes tears much easier than on any of the other colors or maybe it is just because it stands out more either way white Roshes are probably not the way to go I would recommend either another color or another type of shoe in white

Only reason I did not give 5 stars is they do not last long for every day use

I Bought these for my son and he absolutely loves them

I like the shoes very much I wear this almost all days I got 2 pairs of it with the same colorlt 3lt 3D

I have had these coupled with my girlfriend for a couple of months and they feel great They run through the size and are very light perfect for everyday use

I wanted light casual shoes so I bought the all white Chuck Taylor All Star II However I decided to trade them for the wolf grey Nike Roshe best decision You could dress this down with some joggers and a tee or dress it up with a some jeans and a peacoat I need another pair On a side note I wear a size 12 for most dress shoes and basketball shoes but Nike running shoes tend to run narrow for me so I bought a size 13

great shoe very comfortable fits nice and great for light exercise

I loved the look of this shoe and even though I am far from a sneaker head I would gladly purchase this shoe in every color

Bought the shoes and when they came out of the box they had a yellowish tint to them

My son likes the Roshe a lot He said they are very comfortable

i love the shoes they feel perfect They also look sick

Fit great looked great Shipped fast Cute with everything

Shoe is really comfortable it is a little big mane cause my foot is ling but shinny Anyways they came fast I wear them almost everyday Loved them so much I bought three more pairs different colors of course

True to size

Was considering buying the yeezy boost 350 but these are a Good fit very comfortable highly recommend the shoe

great shoe good support and very comfy i love the style and they fit perfectly i always wear them to walk to class great shoe for anyone and everyone

Awesome deal and they shipped really really fast Thanks

Comfortable to workout it also for day wear when you are dressing casual or sporty would highly recommend

I purchased these to strictly work out in I made a very good choice Very comfortable great fit and looks sporty with work out gear Conforms to your foot really snug could have gotten a size smaller if I did not want as much flexibility in the shoe

The ball of my foot hurts like crazy with these shoes No exaggeration but these shoes have the cheapest insoles I have ever seen inside any shoe Expected way better quality for the price do not see how these are worth anything over 29 99 considering the materials and construction of the shoe But I bought them I am stuck with the decision Look nice

Really comfortable and relaxing shoes Only fear is the bottom sole getting too dirty so only wear these when it is nice out

Not what you expect for a price tag of 80

This shoe is great Real comfortable Looks great I am going to buy these in every color

Feels great to move ur toes around with these shoes on

I ordered these shoes and they got to me in a timely no hassle manner And my son loves them

Great price so light you can barely tell you have shoes on Looks great with any outfit just a overall great shoe

bought for teenage son who loves them I just purchased another color for him as well

These shoes are very light weight most tennis shoes are not meant for more than a few hours these are an all day pair of shoes my 13 yr old son loves them and puts them on immediately after basketball and football practice The support and comfort are worth the price

Never had a pair of roshes before Was hesitant at first about the fit and comfort even though I read the reviews Let me say I am totally a believer now and wear these pretty much every day They are super comfy and would recommend to anyone

I purchased these shoes for my 13 yr old son who loves them

I asked for these from my parents and was so impressed with the comfort when I put them on

Great fit and awesome comfort Definetly would recommend them to someone else

Bought these for my 14 year old son He claims these shoes are the most comfortable shoes he is had He loves the looks and I am sure the fact that they are popular amongst his high school friends does not hurt Purchased these on sale and had a 20 off coupon so these were even a better value

Very comfortable and stylish I have several pairs and I will definitely be buying more

The comfort and style you cannot beat Just do not wear in snow or rain as the mesh will let moisture and water run through But best pair of shoes I own hands down

I got these for casual wear for my 17 year old son and he loves them He said they are very comfortable and light

I recommend Nike Roshe to everyone they are great to wear they are comfy and casual

My kids love these shoes They wear good and are very durable Recommended for all types of feet

I strongly advise anyone ordering these to know your size I am a true size 11 but my in store purchase required that I go to the next size based the color as light blue I ordered the black black Roshe on line and it was entirely too small Had to go to a size 12 in black did not understand that Nike needs to stay true to size in all measures Great shoe though

works with pants as casual shoe or for active wear

I customized mine and dame they look and feel nice

Bought these for my son he loves them super comfy and light weight

I would totally recommend these shoes to anyone because they fit you true to size and are comfortable to wear The material is light which allows your feet to have a breathability Good Buy 110

Looks like they sent me someone elsereturns They looked trashed I returned them

They are unbelievable I would highly recommend them

I can wear these shoes all day I love the way they fit

I am on my feet all day so these shoes are extremely comfortable It is a little too big for me I Ordered a 7 because there was no 6 5 but I just wear some thick socks and rock it out Overall amazing shoes I am definitely getting another pair in a fun color

I bought these so I would not have to wear black dress shoes at work Since I am behind the counter all day at work standing up my feet really take a beating But then there blend in and make it better

Bought for my son and he says he loves them and they are comfortable

Shoe fit was just perfect Need couple of days to finally get full feel on the shoe

Really liked the feel of this shoe and how light it is Took two wears to finally get the full effect

Shoe runs big I will have to return and go down half a size

Be Careful To Get The Right Fit Grip On Bottom Can Wear Out A Little Fast But Overall Pretty Great

Nice shoes good for training Maybe a little snug at time but not enough to drop the rating of the shoe

Best comfortable shoes ive gotten and look perfect

These shoes are very good You can wear them for a really long time You can wear them in the least 35 xc2 xb0 Thats really good Get these

it is like now I only have one pair of shoes I only wear these unless I plan to party or look good for pictures I would not buy from finish line tho simply for the face that ch and s sports sells these same shoes for like 50 60 dollars there is no real difference so why pay moreAnyway great shoe definitely gonna buy more

I bought these shoes because I really liked the style and I was looking for something light but at the sametime comfortable that I can use anytime or casual Friday work They turned out to be exactly just that very comfortable light weight true to size and they go with mostly anything

Love them they are comfortable The color was perfect to match my shirt I will probably order a few more pair

Brought these for my son he has many pairs of shoes and this is the only pair he goes mom I can wear these around school all day he loves them

You will see your average person wearing these shoes I bought a more limited Roshe because I like the look But the hype of the sneaker is not all that Granted I got mine for a decent price knowing the rarity of the sneaker they did not match up to what I thought The mesh material is a let down and the lockdown for the sneaker is not the best That being said 70 dollars for a casual running shoe is a price that I can recommend to anyone

I recommend any type of Nike Roshe products the comfort and size satisfied me 100 it is quality that counts not the price

I wear a mens 13 I bought a pair of roshes true to my size The toe is made of mesh and when I wore them there was an inch of extra space in between my toe and the toe of the shoe I suggest you buy at least a half size smaller Other than that the shoe looks amazing and is super comfortable

I have 10 pairs of Roshes so I love the style and comfort but beware of this Sail Dark Ash model I am guessing FNL got a large return batch which is why these reappeared on the site after being gone for so long I ordered a pair and the pair I received arrived crushed with no shoe stuffing and appeared to be worn with scuffs on the heel and midsole and a Macyreturn sticker on the box I processed an exchange and the replacement pair was the same condition with an added dirt scuff on the heel

These shoes are the best in my opinion They feel veey light on my feet and i deel like i could where them all day Along with comfort they feel very durable I think they will last me a very long time Hey these you will not regretit

The shoes are great feeling and look sick but the mesh on mine have already ripped in between the tongue and my big toe on the left shoe I workout and play pickup basketball in them too but was not that hard on them Wish I could get a new replacement for free since its been less than a month

comfy and very good for running i bought these nice shoes and they were wirth it

It is one of the best shoes in the market I like the comfort and also allows me to maneuver around the court easily Durability is an issue my current pair upper right shoe is ripped and left toe has 2 small holes in less than 2 weeks Nike should reinforce the toe area to make it a better shoes

Although the durability of the shoes is questionable the six month warranty on them covers it The outsole of the shoe is nice and has great traction but I wish Nike added a toe cap protector The top of the shoe always seems to wear out before the outsole of the shoe The cushioning on the shoes makes it worth any doubts and concerns They are very comfortable and require little to no break in time Overall these are my favorite tennis shoes They have great cushioning good traction and a decent shoe life

I had been a big fan of the Roshe line in the past but there have been some obvious cuts to quality over the years The first wear of these shoes the upper and outsole separated I was out casually walking not using them for sports or running and they just started to fall apart I was shocked that my shoes started to disintegrate from out under me and worse yet as I kept walking throughout the day my feet started to hurt as the cushioning I got from past pairs just was not there These are a big miss

Shoe Runs a bit small I am a 10 but had to exchange them for a 10 5 Go half size bigger if you are buying Overall shoe is comfortable very stylish looks and feels amazing

2 The sizing is small period I wear 11 5 Nike for almost everything and these were close to a full size small I would need a 12 5 to even come close to fitting

I have worn size Large in Nike for the past 15 years and they are usually pretty consistent The sizing on the item was way off I ordered and received the Large and it fit like a small I returned it and ordered the XL It was large probably and XL in circumference around the waist too big for me but the sleeve length was like a Medium Crazy

My son did not even want to walk in them because they hurt

The Roshe runs are definitely not a bad shoe they are great The simplistic design is very stylish in my opinion and they are very light on the feet My only complaint is that they are not an all day shoe What I mean is I would recommend them if you were maybe going out on a date or even just going out one night because they will do just fine for what they are it is just for an all day shoe they are not great Me personally after a long day where I walk an average of 5 miles they start to discomfort my foot

These are great looking cleats but for those of you with wider feet you should consider something else I really love the idea of making Jordan basketball shoes into football cleats and I hope Nike continues that trend Hopefully a are release of the Jordan 3 cleats or other styles

Loved the main fabric It was not see through and the fabric was silky However the back mesh does not last Mine has huge holes after it was stretched

I have rotated 2 Cage 3for almost 11 months one in US 9 and the other in US 9 5 The shoes run 1 2 size smaller than your regular shoe size but only at the toe box where the US 9 one gave a lot of jamming and cr and Ing issues This version of Cage 3 requires a mild break in due to the webbed drag on cage system so it can be a little tough at first but after a couple of hours in it becomes a bliss A few months in the shoes have held themselves but the outsole becomes way too slippery but manageable as I am rotating between 2 pairs something I got out of the Lunar Ballistec as well

Ordered mediums purely for a snugger fit around the waist but no where in the description does it say that these pants are a long fit Way too long since so baggy at the ankles Will likely return

Unlike many reviewers my usual Nike size 10 5 fit me best in this model In fact I originally bought a half size up and they were just a bit too long I would rather not wear thicker or double socks to fill the space so I had to exchange them Point is if you can try a couple sizes at the same time you might be better off The Cage 3have officially replaced the Zoom Vapors for me They do not feel any heavier they are just as if not more comfortable and they are more durable They also look much better in person and on my feet than they do in photos

These roshe one shoes are very painful on the heal area They rub my Achilles tendon and heal causing pain and blisters I am not the only one to complain me and several friends all feel the same way

When I first heard these were being released I was ecstatic The 11s are my all time favorite Jordans and I went a little crazy and ended up getting four different colorways since I did not know if we would see these release ever again

Love this shoe But I have one issue why do not they make this style in size 12 512 is slightly too small and 13 make me look like a clown I am 5 Very disappointed but hopefully the next version of this style will have the 12 5

I ordered these shoes about 3 months ago expecting the main color to be brown but was disappointed the they were mainly green Because of that I rarely wear them and when i do it is to go to my work office After mild use one of the shoes ripped now randomly on the sides I have several nike shoes for all purposes nothing like this has ever happened

So I got these shoes and I was super pumped then after 1 week they managed to get a giant hole on the top So now i cant wear them because the hole is so big and my toe pops out I so not recommend these shoes

My 12 years old son love Zoom Cage 3

I will start off by saying this shoe is remarkably light and comfortable which is even more impressive when you consider that it is marketed as a stability shoe as opposed to performance You will be hard pressed to find a better feeling stability shoe on the market Hands down the best feeling tennis shoe I have ever worn Depending on your foot it can easily compete with the Air Vapor in terms of comfort In fact I prefer the feel of the Zoom Cage 3 Anyways the reason that this shoe earns 4 stars rather than 5 is that it falls short when it comes to durability

I own probably 10 or so of the older version of this shirt I wear them constantly and I can only hope they last me forever because I absolutely hate the new fit I am not at all a fan of the new shoulder seam and the length is so much shorter than the old version Why mess with a good thingGuess I will just have to extract careful with the ones I have because I will not be buying any more of those new design Or maybe I will just have to find another brand with something similar to the old ones

Would recommendI have had these shoes for four years and they are still in good condition to this day Amazingly comfortable as well Used for everyday wear the gym and a variety of sports

These cleats are not only classy when it comes to style but also durable and comfortable to play in

Three changes are most notable First the shoe is lighter This translates into a little less cushioning which lets you feel court impacts a bit more The second change is that the sole of the shoe provides a smaller contact patch This makes the shoe feel a little less grippy and stable Finally the shoe is narrower which is a good thing for me Overall the shoe has performed and help up fine for me I will be buying several more pairs

Best tennis shoe I have worn in a long time Lots of support and cushion is light and has great traction I ordered a half size larger than I usually wear

I have had these shoes for a few months and just rolled my ankle with them I have constantly rolled my ankles wearing these but recently it is caused injury I have been playing tennis for 7 years now and I have never had an issue with an ankle injury maybe I am getting old i am 32 maybe it was just unlucky i am not sure but these do not seem to provide sufficient ankle support

I have had these shoes over a month and nothing I have tried can make them quiet A little noise hear and there would be fine but these things are loud with every step Not happy with this considering how much I paid

Got the all white sneaks knowing they had be hard to clean but I did not expect that to be from my own blood The tab on the back of these shoes digs into my heel Within a day I was bleeding all over these sneakers The only way I can wear them is with band aids on the back of my ankles

This shoe lasted my son less than a month before the mesh was torn and the tread was noticeably worn

You would think the whole shoe throughout would be a PURE white like the midsole of the shoe and how the pictures show But once you see these in person you will be sorely disappointed The white on the flyknit it NOT a pure white It is barely even a white it is more of an easter green silver MAYBE in the dark you might not notice but these are a bright summer shoe made to be worn in the daylight I LOVED how this shoe looked in Nikepictures and could not wait to get my hands on them and now I am contemplating whether I should even keep them or not

By far my favorite shoe plenty of support and plush feel while staying lightweight I have had zero foot issues with these no blisters no hot spots no bruises i burn through shoes QUICK its been 2 months and these are still going strong i think these are better than the vapors and a bit less expensive too win win

Would definitely recommend the Flyknit trainers as they are super comfortable and the knit is really beautiful up close I purchased the Oreo pair and love the look and contrast of the black and white

had to go up 0 5 of the size to feel comfortable for the toe Blister at medial surface of right ball of foot after 1 week of play Had to switch to another shoe brighter side is that it is definitely lighter than Cage 2 though

Love the look of the shoe Not that comfortable and the flyknit isnt super soft

I purchased these shoes on 3 12 2018 Wore them three times and midsole is already split parallel to swoosh sign on the sole Expected much better durability Severely disappointed in Nike

Great seeming shoe Lightweight good for summer since it is relatively breathable and all that but the heel feels like it is about 1 2 an inch tall because it slips off my heel a ton and practically slips so far that it falls underneath my heel I laced them up super tight to try to fix it but 1 it did not work and 2 I would not want to wear my shoes like that anyways

I am torn writing this This shoe is the best shoes I have ever tried from Nike as far as initial comfort playability lightness and the durability of the sole However less than 2 months from purchasing these there is a giant hole in the top of the shoe it is not from foot dragging I believe it is from creasing the rubber material on the top of the shoe as your forefoot bends when you sprint on the court See picture below The hole is so bad that it is now ripping my socks when I play it is frustrating because like other reviewers above I think the shoe is nearly perfect

Size up if youre used to the cage 2 fit But once you find the right size these are some of the best shoes on the market They feel light locked in and supportive Also seem pretty durable

These shoes are so comfortable stylish and are a very good everyday shoe I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family

The Color On This Shoe Is Not That Bright it is More Of A Dark Mustard I Was Very Dissapointed Because i Actually Love This Shoe All Around Great Comfortable Show But The Color Is Not Right and Described Correctly or Displayed Correctly

I generally do my running in the early morning right before the sunrise and it is very cold I have found a lot of trouble finding the perfect long sleeve running top that is comfortable flexible wicks sweat and does not retain too much heat To my luck this was it Extremely pleased with this and the glacier blue color is super cute

it is a freaking cloth shoe of course if you are running into trees and rocks and constantly hitting stuff with the edge of the cloth its gonna rip common sense tells you that I love these shoes for what i use them for i can run around in them perfectly fine and they do not ever rip or tear I usually grow out of them I have been buying these for 4 years now and have not ripped a single pair from running or anything Great pair of shoes

Very comfortable shoe fits great looks great Not too narrow Tried the flyknit racer but that shoe felt more narrow this one feels better around the toes

These shoes started showing wear within weeks By a month a hole By two months a ton of wear and a hole so big that three toes stick out Not worth the price So disappointing

I play at the 4 5 level I play 5 days a week and usually burn through the sole of shoes in a little over 2 months these shoes have lasted me over 3 months already and have some more to go before I can even consider sending them back These feel light and fast yet stable enough to change direction with confidence Overall this shoe is the best that I have tried in a long time Nike you guys have out done yourselves I will be buying these shoes for many years to come

From the first moment I purchase my husband his first pair of Roshe sneakers he was hooked Unfortunately this feeling was short lived After his first pair I went ahead and purchased him several colors as you can see in the picture and within a month they all literally ripped making them un wearable What makes it more frustrating is that my husband exclusively wore these with his suit for work

This is a very stylish shoe and I have received several complements Super comfortable once on and play great excellent stop and start only down side is they are really hard to put on

I have purchased and worn over the last 1 1 2 years 6 pairs of the Zoom Cage 2 always size 9 5 just like its Zoom Cage Max Air predecessor which I wore for 21 2 years I play 2 3x weekly The Cage 3 feels a tad narrower and shorter inside than the Cage 2 I like the bootie design but its a bit more snug in the width and toe box vs the Cage 2 hopefully a 5 size larger works

I have had my all black roshes for a while now and I could tell you that they are my most worn shoes If you need a pair of shoes that you could wear everyday for work it is these The downside is the bottoms wear pretty easily because there is foam for traction Also the support is just terrible so I recommend for casual use only Overall a great buy

This is a great casual everyday shoe It does not rip or tear easily and it is very comfortable

Nice shoe just not durable for running If you want them to last I suggest using them as a casual shoe Despite using them as a casual shoe they still ripped within a few months

I love these shoes They are very lightweight very comfortable and fit just right The only issue I had with these shoes was after just a few weeks of regular use the sides ripped I was very disappointed with this because these shoes were great otherwise Nike if you are reading this please make the mesh stronger on the toe piece maybe a little like the upper part by your ankle

I have five pairs four pairs of Roshe Ones and one pair of Roshe Twos and am looking forward to purchasing more The Roshe ones are a little tight on top of the foot at first even after loosening the laces Once you break them in they become even more comfortable than before

I have heard a lot of the shoes an seen them everywhere yet so hard to find color combinations I want in stores Thanks for the NIKE Plus App which allowed me to find the exact pair I wanted Got them when projected and boy oh boy am I happy Looks good nice materials and super comfy Only thing I can see that could be better is the insole is a little stiff and ribbed so takes a little to get used to All and all very happy with the Roshe One THANKS NIKE YOUR THE BEST

Purchased a size 8 5 Normally 8 0 but had a very tight fit at the toes for these type of shoes and fit just fine The metallic like color scheme is very appealing and has new look compared to the navy colored Roshe One

Comfortable with the right amount of support This is my second pair

YOU CANNOT COMPARE OR EVEN CALL THISE ROSHE 1 ONE THE ORIGINAL ROSHES WERE LIKE WALKING ON AIR THERE WAS SOFT AND SPRINGY FELL TO THE SOLE THE NEW OR REDONE VERSION IS HORRIBLE NOW THERE IS AN INSOLE AND MISOLE IS HARD AS A ROCK NOTHING LIKE ORIGINAL FELLS LIKE YOUR WEARING HEELS WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN SORRY

Man I seriously love the design of this shoe but the tread on the bottom is just absolutely horrible

I ordered these pair of Nikes for my boyfriend because he needed a pair of workout shoes and he absolutely loves them He says they are super comfortable and perfect for when he is working out or even in general He wears them out in public as well I have a few pair of Nikes myself and I love them My feet NEVER hurt with Nike shoes I definitely recommend these shoes You will not regret ordering yourself or someone a pair of these They fit perfect as well Very nice shoes My boyfriend loves them so much he wants a grey pair next lol I truly love Nike and it is worth every penny

This was one of my first purchases on Nike com and I was quite pleased I needed a shoe in my collection that I could throw on when Im running errands that were comfortable and looked good The ordering and shipping process was easy and quick I will be ordering more colorways of this shoe and others as well

I love these shoes for their look and comfort However I personalized mine to have a white outside with red laces and red lining The red from the laces have started to dye the white part of the tongue of the shoe The lining from the inside has also started to rub to the outside along ankle I would love these shoes if the red dye was not rubbing onto the white of my shoes Disappointed considering how much I paid for them

I just bought the shoe last week and already see that is starting to come apart the threads are starting to come apart around where my pinky sits

At first I didnt realize the sole of the shoe Everything else is very nice they fit nice arent too tight or loose on the feet Good running shoes or for just style But the sole is very bumpy and its giving my feet blisters But you can easily take the sole out and replace it

Amazing shoe beautifully designed and looks great No complaints So long as you maintain them properly they are easy to clean Another BIG HIT from Nike as always Just Doing It

When it comes to comfort I think this shoe is one of the best in the market it is not like a warm snug fit some of you guys might be thinking of it is more of a light and care free kind of comfortable Now I said this shoe is comfortable but not really for a high intensity workout Some reviewers said that the mesh tears but I had this shoe for a few months and there has been no problem with the shoe whatsoever The problem is still with the mesh though Since it is like a loose fitted shoe if you were to do high intensity workouts your foot might slip off of the sole and potentially twisting your ankle But for simple runs it does the job The cushioning is amazing too My heels are fractured so when it comes to cushioning I need very good cushioning This shoe does the job great Since the sole is so thick it absorbs almost anything If you have not tried this shoe on ever before just get it If you tried it and disliked it well you are just unlucky

After 10 days the shoe completely blew out My teenager when running in gym tried to stop and his foot went though the shoe Tried to get them replaced and they said they were for walking only and would not replace them Even though there were no marks they determined the failure was consistent with normal wear and tear on a 10 day old shoe And that the shoe is not designed for any sporting events or lateral movement

Other than it product running a little wide it is a solid shoe for casual lifestyle

do not get me wrong its a great shoe i loved my pair but after the 7th or 8th time i was running the fabric in the shoe started to tear and now theres a big hole where my big toe is great shoe but not very durable

I have had these shoes for less than two weeks and only used them to wear for school and the mesh has already torn on the side I would expect at least a few months out of every pair of shoes depending on what they are used for and how much they are used But 2 weeksI can not afford to buy a new pair of shoes every two weeks Very upset with the durability of these shoes Although mine did not last I bought the all black pair and I have to say they look very nice Based on looks I give a 5 star But the look does not make up for poor durability I plan on returning the shoes within the next week

I truly enjoy Nike Roshe Ones but I have had durability issues with the 2 pairs I had previously purchased over the course of the last year directly from Nike now on my third pair

Like many other reviews here I loved these shoed when I first got them They are incredibly comfortable But I have had them for about 3 months and have already worn the sole away at the toe making them nearly unwearable as the stitching is coming out I wear these shoes 4 5 days a week for just casual walking around town going to work etc If you are a runner at all I think these shoes would last you no more than a few weeks I cannot recommend due to the durability issues Such a shame

I wore my Roshe 1 playing basketball for four days and they are getting worn already I am very disappointed Nike you need a better material pvery comfortable but step up the game with the material

Right off the bat I have to say that these shoes are extremely comfortable I got these as casuals but also used them for short runs They are not the best in terms of durability I have gotten several scuffs that I cannot seem to get off even with cleaner They are very breathable and feel go on your feet I would not recommend them for a running shoe even though I use them for it I am not a serious runner I highly recommend them as a casual shoe

I ordered a pair of these and really liked them because of the comfort and style I wore them around for about a week and saw some tearing There were 3 tears near the toe box on the shoes This is would be my one of my favorite shoes but the quality was not to my satisfaction Hopefully this was just a bad pair but the quality was awful

This what a great shoe at first I loved the design of the product but its was just not durable It was just used on a regular bases but nothing extreme There are three holes just from walking in them Over all I loved the shoes but they were not just durable enough I would not suggest buying these shoes

I really love the shoe looks great and is also so comfortable My only complaint is that within a year holes were formed in the shoe I did not use these shoes for my heavier workouts runs but more as a causal shoe so I am not sure as to why it was not durable enough to withstand day to day activities

This product is very good Especially for students who are looking for cheap and stylist

I have the neon yellow ones They are pretty sick I like them a lot They feel really comfortable

The shoe perfectly fits my size The padding provided at the bottom is very comfortable during walking and jogging

The shoes are very comfortable they feel great I have only had them for about a few days but I have gotten a blister on my left ankle The blister might mean that the shoes are not suitable for my foot type or I just need to break them in more But the shoes fit fine and feel comfortable to have on my feet and are great walk around in They are a great pair of shoes to wear

Some of the most comfy shoes I have ever owned perfect for long walks when doing city trips

This shoe is very comfortable and is a great shoe for everyday

I do not use these shoes to run in but I wear them as lifestyle shoes they are very comfortable durable and the grey matches with everything Would definitely recommend

I fell in love with these as soon as I saw them Once I tried them on I knew that this pair was my destiny These shoes feel like slippers for me and they fit my athletic normal every day life

I bought these for my sophomore in high school He likes them a lot and says he is getting compliments so good

Bought these for my daughter I think this is probably about her 5th different pair of these and she loves them

This product is great for running or walking all day long or for walking several miles for exercise

I bought these stylish shoes mainly for the looks I like to wear these to school when I go athleticHowever i sometimes find myself wearing these and enjoying them on a normal run I love these shoes and recommend them

This was the second Roshe Run I bought in a month because it is such a great shoe it is extremely comfortable and it looks great there is been days where I barely sit down and these shoes worked great You really can not beat the price of the Roshe Run either it is an overall awesome shoe

This shoe is lghtweight and durable and has great feel

My son loves his new shoes but the pull tan in the back one has already ripped after only a few days Now I notice a hole ripe type has formed at the back of his shoes

These sneakers are just the perfect pair The fit is so relaxing and comfortable you feel light and much more maneuverable

I wouldnt recommend using these as runners because they are more for walking around then legitimate exercise but I love them they are soft flexible and have thick durable soles I would definitely buy them again

very comfortable shoes awesome product to wear and is stylish

These are the most comfortable shoes I have had in a loooong time After buying one pair and wearing them for a week I promptly bought another in a different color

This is a great product although it seemed to run a little small

I had really been wanting a pair of Roshes for a while so I went ahead and bought some great decision comfortable as an everyday shoe as well if you do not want to just have them as running shoes

Fit and feel good Just being worn to kick around in

This are great My son is really liking the Roche show right now and the grey ones are his favorite They are comfortable and fit well

The shoes run a bit large but they are great overall shoes It literally feels like you are wearing a sock SO COMFORTABLE

It feels good looks good and can be worn with anything Highly recommended

The most comfortable shoes I have ever bought Cant wait to get another pair

I originally owned the Nike Roshe Trail that I really liked but they started to rip and I needed a replacement These are doing the job well

I bought these as a gift for my father in gray He loves the fit and the look and said they were super comfortable Hes normally between an 8 5 9 so I went with 9 and that worked out great

I wear these shoes after work and they are far more comfortable than most other shoes Ive had Very cushiony Very breathable Mine havent worn out yet but I can see it might be easy to wear them out since the top is just a breathable mesh

This shoe is super comfortable and good to wear for an everyday use shoe The one thing holding me back from calling it near perfect is the durability I bought a pair and they tore in about 4 weeks Other than that I love the shoe

I got the triple blacks for work I have many other pairs of Roshe Runs at home but these are perfect for working in a dusty shop since the black sole stays clean I will be buying a few more pair

Nothing like some original product to really max out training both on the track and in the gym The comfort level in these shoes is off the chart and style wise you can just never go wrong with Roshe Runs Both in lifting weights and light endurance long distance track running they definitely get the job done and then some Highly recommend these bad boys

Extremely comfortable the wolf grey looks very sleek and trendy Great shoe for most occasions

I bought this shoe about 2 weeks ago I have heard many great things about this shoe so I went and gave it a try The first days I was really satisfied later I notice scratches on the shoes By the next week my shoe is completely torn I used them almost every day for 2 weeks and it completely tears apart The shoes were comfortable but do not buy them thinking they will last you more than a month Very unsatisfactory purchase

Great pair of sneakers Beautiful to look at comfortable to walk and run in

These are the most comfortable shoes ever They look great with anything that I am wearing Feels like I am walking on a cloud

Not only they are priced nicely but they are comfortable

Absolutely love the roshe model Shoes are very comfortable and very stylish Fits true size I highly recommend this shoe

This is a really comfortable sneaker for doing anything I think its a stylish sneaker and is very comfortable for how it looks

This shoe is so comfortable Theres no breaking it in it gives you full support right out the box and will make you a little taller which was fine by me Wonderful product

Look great with shorts or jeans

Out of all the things I bought from Nike this is the best It looks amazing and feels great Are try so hard to keep it clean Over all these are my favorite shoes

Love LoVe LOve LovE these shoes Highly recommend you buy these

the shoe fits great the shoe feels great looks great

I love my black on black roshe sneakers I can wear them with anything and always get compliments on them everytime I wear them

I am very satisfied with the purchase Very comfortable shoe Comfort is what I was looking for

By far the most comfortable best fitting shoes Ive ever owned

The product that I bought was very comfortable which didnt disturb me so I could keep on going as long as I can It also was very light so it felt like I had nothing on It was a very good upgrade

These are a comfortable shoe for warm weather Mesh allows air to flow in and out of the shoe and prevents sweating and smelling feet Also a nice fashion statement with the all white

These shoes are amazing They fit really well but be sure to get your exact size I think the Black Black pair are the best looking pair they are stylish and you can wear them while you run or gym

What an awesome product very comfortable they are durable and you will never going to feel tired using this sneakers also they look very awesome and can fit with almost everything i would definitely recommend them

Great shoes very comfortable and stylish Highly recommend the product

This product is a very comfortable very stylish and sporty

These are very comfortable and light this is my second pair would definitely recommend

Comfy and durable These shoes are great Would highly recommend

I have wanted Roshes for the longest time and finally got some and I am in love Nicest shoe out there at a great price very comfortable and relaxing way easy to clean Super satisfied with these shoes

I really loved this product I had bought myself a pair in January and loved them so much I needed another pair

Amazing product super clean and the most comfortable shoe Ive ever had on foot

this product is very comfortable nice looking and above all very affordable

It was large but the shoe does look very good The only thing I thing I think you should do is to have more size available for small feet

I had bought a pair of Nike Roshes a few months ago and they very comfortable and lightweight It will meet your needs if you are looking for a lightweight everyday shoe or a hardcore running shoe It will meet your needs but I tend to be very careful because I accidentally stepped on a friendpair and they ripped I have had a good experience using mine Hope you enjoy these shoes as much as I do

This shoe is great for walking around but terrible for running in do not get me wrong the shoe is comfortable just not durable enough for running at all I had these shoes for about 2 months and I pretty much ran them to the point of my socks showing at the bottom

I had previously bought another Nike shoe and was slightly dissapointed with the shape So going in I was skeptical However the Roshe was everything I needed It has amazing comfortability making walking around more exciting then I knew possible It is an amazing classic Nike look without being overly expensive I have had them for 3 weeks and still do not have a single stain on them though I have grey not white The size was large however the inside is so comfortable every size works They complete almost every outfit I have perfectly making me wear them almost every day as opposed to my other shoes Great choice and perfect for anyone on a budget

Nike roshes are the best Very comfortable for work and running

this is the best running shoes so far very comfortable and the best cushion

I am very very disappointed in them

Let me start by saying that I really do love these sneakers After reading a ton of negative reviews about the shoe not being recommended for running because of holes developing in the toe area I decided to purchase anyway I did not wear these shoes for running I never even wore them when I was strength training at the gym But after about a year and only wearing the shoes for very casual wear walks around the city I too have noticed the dreaded hole in the toe that this shoe is susceptible to But I will say they were really comfortable for the time that I had them I just wish they would have lasted longer

This shoe is very simple but has a lot of style It feels kind of fragile but has proved to be very durable The only problem is with the lighter colored shoes they have the tendency to retain stains more than a flat surface but this is a problem with all light shoes

I was on the search for a shoe that was stylish and sporty it is a hard balance to strike After hours of research I come upon these guys Went into the store to try them on went for a half size smaller than my Nike Frees and I have worn them every day since They are incredibly comfortable and stylish

Roshe are the best shoe Nike has created since Cortez

I have had this shoe for about 2 3 months and the bottoms are already wearing down a bit more than I would expected and I do not run in them I only use them as a lifestyle shoe but other than that great shoe would recommend

I purchased my second pair of Roshes because my first pair developed holes around my toe area within the first week I gave Nike the benefit of the doubt and figured it was a defect I purchased the second pair around April 3rd and they arrived around April 7th and just within the last week they have a hole again I am extremely disappointed because these shoes are extremely comfortable but a waste of money if you do every day activities I play basketball from time to time and I also use them as dress shoes but they turned out to be a bad buy

I love these shoes I have gotten three pairs obviously but each pair the toes start to come through

I didnt even run with them yet just walked around alot One morning i wore white socks and notice a hole through the mesh Ive now received a voucher two weeks after sending my shoes But Im afraid to buy them again

I got the white roshe runs for myself because they are a good looking shoe and I had a previous pair that I liked a lot When I wore these for the first time at school I received so many compliments on how good they looked I was quite shocked Even my coach said he liked them These shoes are so comfortable as well you really get the bang of your buck for these shoes I would highly recommend these

The hype has died down since Nike releases every color available to the general I remember back then when I would wait for the next drop and everyone would ask me where to get it It is the most low cost good looking shoe that is still hip in the market Im glad it got out but now I see more people wearing them I like the exclusivity it had but also its better to be able to cop it easily

These shoes are so comfortable and the look really cool The only problem I had was that they were kind of narrow and the bottom got stained very easily Other than that it is one of my favorite shoes

I got these shoes as a Christmas gift and I was extremely overjoyed I love the look of these shoes as they are very stylish for casual wear However the durability of my shoe was unfortunately not up to standard A few weeks in a slight hole formed while I was just walking around which then grew to be much bigger later on to the point where it was highly noticeable and not fixable I am not sure if my shoe was a defect but I am surprised they ripped so easily despite of how well I took care of them These shoes are very expensive and I thought they would last longer than 3 months I would highly appreciate a refund or an exchange if possible

The shoe is quite comfortable I mus say I really cannot complain about it the nice cushioning in the feet protects and helps my arch

The first week I wore them a hole developed on my left shoe and is now a considerable size also the plastic the sole is made of gets worn down and dirty easily

This shoe is great I have had mine since they came out Very comfy Only complaint is that they scuff easy I have the grey and white pair maroon and black and all white

I thought these were very Comfortable weather walking or running They are also nice looking and seem to be holding up well

I bought these for my son and he loves them Recommend them great shoes

These shoes were able to complete my intended use to have nice looking shoes that go with about anything and shoes that did not absolutely kill my feet the sole were not as nice as i expected them to be a bit to ribbed Also gets scuffed extremely easily

I am very happy with the shoe and how good it is The overall durability is great and they are comfortable It is good for running and for casual wear I give this product a 10 10

These shoes are great for running as well as for your daily life awesome shoes

Overall the whole experince was great I recieved my shoes very fast and i am satisfied with how they fit amd perform i would definitely recomend this product

My son got these for his 13th bday Said they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned He will definitely be getting another pair as he grows out of these

This shoe fit perfectly nice dark color printing was great all in all we are very happy with our purchase

This is a great product When I received them I slipped them on and they were so comfortable and lightweight They are also affordable Definitely would recommend

Goes with anything and simply so comfortable Go a half size down

My son said they were very comfortable and he loved the style He is very picky

It is so cool and I really like it Fitness comfortable perfect

I am a nurse who needed comfortable shoes and while I did get that I was disappointed once a hole started to form on the toe of one of the shoes I did not use them for any sort of training or running just simply for work Total disappointment and waste of money

These are seriously comfy I bought these for my husband who always complains that his feet hurt but he loves them

I purchased these shoes for style rather than running shoes They go well in any type of clothing shorts jeans sweat pants etc Very comfortable as I am sure they would be while running as well Do not wear them if it is wet out your feet will get soaked because of the mesh upper GREAT SHOE

This shoes fit really good and very comfortable The only bad thing is that they rub a little big

Good lifestyle shoe Very nice and comfortable for everyday school walking ext Very light weight and breathableAnd the midsouls are easy to clean

Perfect show just need better knitting Especially for people how use their toes a lot or should I say sprinters

These shoes are very comfortable I wear tgem for daily activities and to work where I stand for the entire time They have really helped my feet stop aching at work and they look good too Highly recommend

The ridged insole is a nice touch and feels amazing when you are actively wearing the shoe It feels like a gentle massage on the base of your foot The mesh upper makes the shoe very breathable A must have in my opinion

Extremely comfortable stylish and great for run or for casual wear

This is one of the best shoes Ive gotten their vey light and very comfortable

I love running in the shoes very comfortable Not to forget very stylish as well

This is a great shoe its comfortable quite durable and great style I love Rosh

I can not believe how good this product is This is phenomenal I can run and be comfortable

I bought these shoes because lots of people wear these and I thought they were pretty cool I did have to wait a while for my shoes to come but it was because I customized my own shoes I got many compliments at school and then bought my mom some shoes Everyone should get a pair of these They fit with all clothing extremely comfortable and great for showing off

My son really wanted these shoes and he is very happy with his purchase He said they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn The only complaint would be the big white soles they show every speck of dirt

Super comfortable extremely durable with the thicker sole on the shoe it is a really classic look that goes with anything and for how chunky the bottoms are the shoe is actually really lightweight and comfortable with the all mesh upper

These shoes are very comfortable and they have a very nice look to them

The shoe is very comfortable and goes well with anything you wear I recommend this shoe for people looking for a casual comfortable shoe

I bought these shoes because many other people have them and they have mostly good things to say The air flow on these shoes is excellent and the comfort symmetrically These do get dirty fairly quickly and are more so meant for jogging and walking around in that for hardcore marathon running They are perfect if you just throw them on to go to school in and look very good with everything

Love my Roshe Ones Got them primarily as a lifestyle shoe for every day occasions but they also look great for going out Very hard to get these shoes dirty so they are perfect for bars and lounges and places were people are prone to stepping on you or spilling drinks on your kicks

Very comfortable shoe amazing for running Also good for casual wear Gave a pair to a friend as well and he loved them too

Thiese are great shoes for a great price and my dear son Kaleb absolutely loved the fact that his were customized

Although the product was too big on me it was still very comfortable and great for running

Nice casual shoe in a classic color way Good for on the go

These shoes are the best looking shoes Ive ever had

Very comfy and light shoe I like that fact that they can be a running shoe if they need to be or they can be walk around shoe

Lookin good feelin good I get tons of compliments on them and they are super comfy

Best sneakers on planet earth Style comfort look everything about them

Only had these about a week but I really enjoy them I do not use them to work out with just for about town They are comfortable and I love the look They fit about the same as other running shoes I have purchased

These sneakers were a gift My husband loved themThey remind him of the original Cortez from back in the daylovemysneakers

I was skeptical because I have large feet and usually running shoes are too narrow these are absolutely perfect because of the loose material on top they expand to my feet I love everything about these shoes and will continue to order more Thanks and great job design team

Bought these for my 13 yr old son he wants a pair in every color now

Really good shoes they look really nice and they feel good

My experience with these shows have been great This type of shoe is my third pair They are very comfortable very lasting fits perfectly and good in style too I can wear them to go to the gym or run and also wear them to go out Friends and family have asked me what type of shoes would i recommend for running and first shoes that come to mind are the Roshes Once they get the shoes they do not stop thanking me and buying the Roshes because they feel good while running and walking

I ordered these for my boyfriend for his birthday and hes in love Its a struggle to find him shoes that fit both the length and the width of his feet but these shoes fit both Awesome shoes

A nice casual shoe for everyday activities Only problem is that the mesh material is not very durable and can easily tear from even just a small scrap on concrete

Shoes are very popular Hard to find in stores They are very comfortable Most of the kids in my sons school wear them

Most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn Nike Roshes are the best

My husband totally fell in love with these shoes extremely comfortable

Got these for my girlfriend 3 months ago and after two and a half months for wearing them 2 3 times a week the shoe ripped open right above the big toe I will not be buying these again which is a shame considering that these are stylish and very comfortable I would only rate this product one star but they are SUPER comfy

I have five pairs of these Love them So comfy Daily wear

The most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn so far Im thinking about buying this product for a friend

this shoe is amazing and I would recommend it to people who like to run or like to have a clean look The flexibility is great it DOES NOT CREASE and all around Great shoe

Very high quality release from Nike dress them up or down

Great running sneakers and theyre cute I enjoy them

Basic but awesome Comfortable and sleek Would recommend them to anyone

This product is absolutely horrible I bought these shoes for my son about fifteen weeks ago and he had worn them about two days a week to school as he has other pairs of shoes as well The big toe on the right shoe is ripped through both layers and the mesh is ripped and pulled in countless other places His toe is sticking through and is visible through the hole This is not wear from activeness this is wear from extremely poor quality Also the sole is horrible too as they have been squished down and have crackswhich they should not have My son thought they were very cool looking so that was one reason why I bought them for him He thinks they are very comfortable so I will give you folks at Nike that Overall I will never buy my son this product ever again

I love these they are so comfortable i would definitely recommend

I do not use this for running but I wear it for comfort and casual wear and I love them This is my 3rd pair and they are a great purchase

Very comfortable and light Absorb the ground and I feel Im running on air

Love the look and new smell of the shoes Shipping was prompt Everything was great

Extremely comfortable and athletic for a great price you can wear them with anything

By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

I have had my Roshes for a year and 2 months and they still look new I mainly use them for football workouts now but they are definitely worth it

Very comfortable shoe I primarily use them to walk in and casual dress I have several different colors and styles of these shoes

My son loves these shoes because they are unmistakably cool However a week after he got them he ran into a bush playing football and a twig pierced the top fabric of the shoe

I ordered these shoes for my boyfriends birthday he loves them I also customized them thank you all for the great customer service and fast shipping

The product fits very well and is very comfortable but unfortunately the side of my shoe tore only after a couple of weeks Although they are still usable I would expect more durability from such a prestigious company and popular shoe I would love to get some help from nike as soon as possible

Roshe are comfortable to wear when you are running

Great shoe perhaps the most comfortable shoe I own and the all red looks great

Love the color its a wonderful shoe If you do not have it your missing out in a very comfortable shoe Love the Quality in the shoe

Im not only a bigger athlete but Im an older one as well Meaning my joints really enjoy a nice cushioned ride The Roshe run provides just this Using minimal materials the roshe is perfect for lounging around or a quick trip to the gym I wouldnt recommend it for running or cross training but its perfectly suited as a comfortable shoe to hit the weights in

these are a great basic shoe We purchased as an extra pair

I love this colorway of the roshe runs very affordable and very comfortable and very stylish

In this particular shoes I love them every aspect especially style comfort durability craftsmanship and price You cant go wrong purchasing these shoes

The Nike Roshe One shoe is great It looks very stylish it is very comfortable and the product lasts quite a long time I definetley reccomend this product for running or even just casual purposes as the shoe is low profile but still giving a sleek look

I wear these shoes in more casual occasions and they are probably the most comfortable and cushioned athletic shoe I have worn Also very lightweight

Great shoe very comfortable I would recommend this shoe to friends and family

I like the colorway of this shoe Only found on Nike I buy frequently and Nike is very straight forward great every time The show came the exact shipping date You can run in these shoes but also Wear them on a night out I rate these a 10 for sure

Awesome shoes Love the color choices Great looking shoes and go with any outfit

This product is very comfortable and recommened to anyone i can Recently bought a pair for my girlfriend and she loves them Thanks

Roshe are very very nice in the shoe look and it is comfortable

do not run in them it has no stability and breaks quickly however they are comfortable for daily wear

Ive seen these shoes on people daily they are very cool looking so I was sold on getting a pair or two Went to a local shoe store to try them on and they were nothing id expect from Nike Very hard sole and the structure of the show is sloppy Just a piece of mesh sewn to the sole I felt like Id rip them if I walked ran in them Even the lace holes looked off and uneven These are just trendy with zero comfort Im sticking with Air Maxes Well worth the money

I bought these for my son for school Nike are usually very durable and last most of the school year This pair the big toe is ripping at the top of the shoe Thats not wear from use its poorly made

Overall a great shoe comfortable stylish and durable I look forward to purchasing more in the future

I was so happy when I found out Nike com had an all red pair of Roshes in stock I ordered them and was greatly pleased thank you Nike

it feels so comfortable and the color is so cool I also recommeded my friends to have it

do not get me wrong the shoe is great but after two months they ripped on me I was running which I do not do in them often and I heard a rip and looked down and I could see my sock Theres now a hole above my big toe Dissapointed that I wasted my money

I love this shoes I bought Nike zoom elite8 couple weeks ago and I really loved it Now I got the roshe and realized that this item is lighter than the other one Now I love both shoes

I love the style of the shoe great price great feel but mine ripped at the toe after only 3 months of occasional running and wearing them to work every now and then I do anything highly physical for a living so I kinda hoped they were gonna last awhile before that happened Great shoe but do not plan on wearing them for very long sad face

High quality products and fast shipping with easy tracking info

Good comfortable Stylish for any type of event Durable soles Materials can be a little tougher for my liking

I thought these shoes would last me at last a couple of years I would not recommend these as your daily driver

First pair of Roshe and will be purchasing more

I ordered the all red roshe run It is lightweight and stylish

Absolutely love these shoes I do not use them to run in These are more of a casual shoe They run about a half size big I normally wear a 10 but purchase a 9 5 in Roshe The comfort is unmatched Barely feels like I have shoes on I love them

The product was very comfortable The color is move and the size was perfect The durability is pretty low and I feel like it rips quite easily

I love how comfy they are I wear them all the time and they match everything I always get compliments on them

Colorway is pure fire Shoe is fire The looks you get for wearing the shoe fire Comfortability is great also Cant go wrong with a pair of Nike Roshes esepcially when the colorway is FIRE

Rose runs ate the best The simplicity comfort and color selection cant be matched You cant go wrong with roshes

Loved the style of the roshe run but these were very thin at the front I do not really understand why They are a very nice shoe all around but I think the functionality of them is just not there for fall winter running

The quality of the shoe was very good Very comfortable like most Roches The bright red color really stands out I would recommend to anyone

Shoes fit like a glove very comfortable and durable

This is the perfect shoe to have Comfortable and the shoe looks good

I think everybody has roshes because other people do Roshes are awful for running and are not durable I have had these for a fairly long time but after just a few weeks the soles have little to no waffle pattern on the bottom Everybody says these are very comfortable The insole is like 1 millimeter think and very flimsy They are not as comfortable as people say at all This shoe is cheaply made I do not recommend these I would get a pair of zx fluxes for around the Same price and way more comfortable

Shoes looks great in person Amaze of the all red color didnt waste no time to rock it

This product is amazing The roshe is the ideal shoe not only to run in but also for comfort on an everyday basis They are stylish and fit like a glove I really do not understand why every person does not own a pair

I am usually a huge fan of the Nike free shoes but I read a bunch of reviews how these were so comfortable and they look a little better than frees to wear casually so I went and got a pair They have not disappointed They fit comfortAbly right out of the box and feel like they are barely there I can wear them running or even going to a bar so they are pretty versatile as well Planning to buy another pair in a different color

Pretty good looking shoe and also very comfortable for every day use do not really have any complaints with this product but If I could change something it would be a thicker fabric in the front part of the shoe

I bought those Nike roshes run red violet camo And let me just say that they are best shoes and will ever be Hopefully this trends of roshes last for a long time The feel and everything in this is amazing

Black on black goes with pretty much anything

I love the way they look and the comfort of the shoe

I purchased the navy blue and black Nike Roshe Runs last week and I can sincerely say I enjoy wearing them They are extremely comfortable and easy to match I highly recommend them

They last long they are stylish they are a great fit for all types and most importantly they get the job done So go get yourself a pair of Nike Roshes Maybe even two

Bought shoes for my son And he loves them Would highly recommend

This shoe is ultra comfortable Quick shoe to throw on weather I am going to the gym or to class

The size and durability of the sneaker is amazing Im so glad that invested in a running sneaker like nike

I just got this show last week so far so good it is very comfortable

I find the Rosheto be very comfortable but a bit on the narrow side therefore causing rips in the material I wish they held up better but for the price it is a decent value

The are very flexible and i love how they accomdate to the width and size of my feet

Running in these will make the mesh on the toe box tear I owned these for two months and they are now trash Very upsetting

These Roshe runs are very comfortable You can wear them in casual clothing or sporty clothing which is what I really like about these shoes Running in the Nike roshes is really comfortable too Over all I would highly recommend these shoes to anybody

I use these shoes weekly for comfort at work they feel so good on my feet

I bought these at my local ch and s within a week the sole has begun to show cracks that make it look horrible and there is a obvious stitching defect on the tongue of the shoe so that it doesnt sit in the midline although they are comfortable they are a leisure shoe and bought them for looks over practicality so was hoping for better build quality

Great product and extremely comfortable and cool I would definately recommend

Only downfall is the bottoms wear out super fast

Highly recommend this product for those who walk a lot in nyc I highly suggest not to wear it in the rain since there is no grip and you could slip

this shoe is one of the nicest shoes I have ever had it is breathable and lets your feet move a bit freely when walking Also I really like tge wavy sole that kinda massages your feet when walkingThe downside is that you cannot wear this in rain since water will pour right through that Even morning dew will seep right through if you walk through the grass

the shoe has an overall good rating for me I would recomend to my friends who run a lot and lots of crossfit I could run all day with the shoes Roshe Run

My son loves these shoes and he will order again when this pair needs replaced My other two kids want the same brand

The shoes are comfortable my job required me to walk The shoes only lasted a few months before they started to rip the fabric is VERY thin I sent them to Nike they told me the shoes were not made for physical activity and they kept them

I bought this sneaker for my son I always buy from Nike com As always they were perfect true to size and awesome quality

A pair of shoes that are stylish durable extremely light and a bit more on the cheaper side I would definitely say roshes are the way to go Not only can you wear them to practice for cross country track or running for a different sport you could also rock them in a regular outfit and still will pull off the good looks In my opinion I could own every color of roshes and I would be satisfied

Great Comfortable True to size Also the quality is excellent

my rosches that I received help me fit in and look cool in sports and at school thank you

This roshe run is very durable and very comfortable I recommend this product

Great fit comfortable for cross training sport activities

This by far are the most comfortable shoe that I own the sole in them is amazing I plan on getting some more soon if you want them to fit snug get a Half size smaller for example if you wear a size 10 like me get a 9 5 for a snug fit I did not know that at first so I got a 10 still fits amazing just not snug but it is up to the buyer of course so I recommend this show but that just my opinion try them and make your own conclusion about them

This shoe is great perfect for working out with or just hanging out with your friends you will not regret it if you buy them

I love this shoe It is very comfortable and looks really great I would definitely recommend it

This is a type of shoe I definitely recommend it is insanely comfortable for all types of feet and for all you short people it gives you a couple inches with its extremely padded sole Anyway this is a Nike shoe I definitely recommend 5

Bought as a back to school shoe for my son so far so good They look great

The Roshes lived up to the hype by having a sleek silhouette and an extremely comfortable experience

Overall I am very happy that I got these shoes They are so comfortable and fitting When I wear them everyone says they love them and overall I give the shoe a 5 5

The material is nice and unique It is very comfortable I want to get every style and color

Good tread on the shoes do not pronate too much and make sure to tie tightly

I bought these for my 17 year old son at his request He is very active plays HS football etc He wanted these mostly for new school shoes He likes the way they look and has remarked they are very lightweight and comfortable They seem to breathe be cool important here in Austin Not a very structured heavy supportive shoe but great for the heat here He has worn them about a week and LOVES them

My son will not wear anything but Nike Roshes

The sneakers are very comfortable I wear them every single day and have had no issues in the months that I have worn them I will definitely continue to buy and recommend these sneakers

Excelent product my suns in love they worshiped

I bought these shoes strictly for the purpose to wear every once in awhile maybe a few times a month After I tried them my original purpose went out the window These shoes are so comfortable I can not help but wear them as often as I can I have only had them a week and I am already considering buying another pair In my situation they ran a little long in size I had to return them and get a half size smaller but even with going down a half size the width was perfect Definitely recommend these shoes

My 11 yr old son loves these sneakers so much that I think he would wear them to bed if I let him They are very thin material though so may not work for the winter

great shoe feels great seems very durable shipping took longer than expected

The mesh is very soft on the outside and cushioned on the inside The insole feels odd at first but is very comfy overall

Loving my new shoes They are very comfortable and love the style

Fell in love with these shoes ever since I put them on I am addicted These are my new favorite shoes

I recently ordered two pairs of these roshes i really enjoy them and think they are great for their price They run a little larger than other nikes I only had one problem the wore a little bit on the toe while i was at a pitching lesson working on my landing

I wear them all day and also to conditioning and they are always comfortable

Usually wear a 10 5 in Nike but had to drop to a 10 in these Very light and comfortable Great rebound in the soles

The Roshe is my sonfavorite shoe He has a pair in just about every color

I had the roshe for 6 months I usually run around and play basketball in them After awhile of wearing them the mesh gets dirty quickly and it is hard to clean I saw the the midsole rip off and the mesh get holes in the toe area All in all it needs more improvement

My kid needed some better shoes for sports Thank you for these shoes and the great price I was buying him way more expensive ones that were not as durable

The product feels great it is really comfortable and very light it runs true to size

This shoe has a great insole light weight and is extremely comfortable Definitely worth the money and would recommend to anyone 100x over

I usually run a lot to stay in shape in gravel roads and pavement and their durability is awesome

These shoes are a must have for any shoe rotation Simple in design and color Comfortable for all day use do not workout in these they are not made for it These are strictly for casual wear Definitely recommend these shoes

Second pair same color everyday shoe very comfortable

The Nike Roshe one is a footwear meant for everybody I love the comfort of the shoe the color and it fits well

The saying you get what you pay for applies here These shoes are so comfortable that I bought three more pairs The quality is exceptional and the shipping is quick I like the option of the different styles and colors on their website and the ability to build your own pair

I love this shoe Max comfort and stylish Awesome

I purchased for my teenage son He loves the look and the feel of these Very comfortable

Bought these for my husband and he is obsessed He can wear them for workouts and for everyday use So comfortable My turn to get a pair

Most comfortable shoe that I have ever worn I would recommend them to anyone that wants a casual shoe they are not great for running though

Honestly I could not have asked for a better product These shoes are amazing I mostly like them because you can wear them work out or you can throw on some pants and dress it up These shoes go great for anything and that is what I love most about them I definitely recommend making this purchase

My son loves these shoes it is the only kind he will wear Had to buy 2 pair to start school

This is a great walking shoe to just walk around in while letting your feet feel comfortable

I am not exaggerating when I saw this but when I have the roshe on it feels like I am just wearing socks The comfortability is incredible so much so that I just ordered a second pair in a different color I am already in love with roshes I do feel however that the shoe runs slightly large so definitely make sure to try it on before ordering

These were purchased for my 13 yr old son who picked them out because he loved the style he says they are so comfortable and my feet feel aired out He uses them for everyday use and also to play basketball Although not a basketball shoe he likes them for all his athletics because his feet do not feel sweaty

The shoes are really comfortable I instantly loved the color and I do not regret for a second buying it It fitted perfectly and that is why I like it even more

A very comfortable shoe and a great fit I could wear it anyday

I did not buy the shoes to do heavy duty running I got them more for casual wear and they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn The top feels like a sock the sole still gives support and it breathes which is awesome I highly recommend this as a walking or running shoe

These shoes look and feel awesome they are also super comfy

Soooo comfortable and stylish I would recommend to everyone

Fits true to size very comfortable for everyday running or just for a casual day

This is a different style of shoe than I am use to because of the mesh top however the shoe is more durable than it looks It is a very comfortable shoe in my opinion The fit is very good not too loose not too tight

Roshehave a great fit are lightweight and look great

I already have 3 pairs because I love these shoes They look great and do not cost too much

This is a great casual shoe it is comfortable in many aspects however I would not recommend these shoes for running The sole is incredibly thick especially towards the heel where a runner needs support If you run track or cross country you know not to wear these Sole is not flexible but is rather sturdy So in a nutshell these shoes are great for just going out school etc Shoe shows true aesthetic and looks great on everyone

These are great and I would recommend to anyone Great shoe

I recommend the Nike Grey Roshe One for anyone in need of a comfortable well designed sneaker This shoe looks really good but would not recommend it for acutal running The price is incrediblely reasonable and makes for one of the best running sneakers on the market

QUALITY IS GREAT NICE FIT LIGHTWEIGHT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I am a PE teacher coach and workout regularly I lead a very active lifestyle and my Nike Rosche Runs allow me continue to do so while maintaining comfort throughout the day

I used these shoes for 2 months and then they ripped along the toes and then the front part of the sole wore down all the way until it ripped through the sole on both shoes

This product is worth every penny you get what you pay for Durable reliable and the comfort level is amazing I recommend this shoe to everyone whoruns trains or just stand for several hours a day Trust me it is worth it

This product is amazing because they are super comfortables and light so you do not feel like you are wearing any shoes

I love these shoes They are very comfortable and stylish but I probably would not recommend wearing them for running Mine were not very durable

Very comfortable shoe Feels like I am walking on clouds

This shoe is one of the best shoes I have ever bought these are comfortable and very durable and go with any outfit

I purchase several Nike shoes throughout the year This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I wear and the most affordable I have multiple pairs and will likely continue adding more

I think this shoe is excellent It is very comfortable for everyday use like walking and it also is very comfortable when running This product is also very stylish too Overall Great Product

I have been a fan of this sneaker from the moment that I put it on My feet are on the small sideand somewhat narrow Nike seems to fit me the best of all the shoes on the market I am constantly getting complements on the design All in all a very well manufactured all around shoe

A very comfortable shoe and fits perfectly to feet

These are probably the most comfortable and useful pair of shoes i have owned they are super durable look great and provides a lot of support to the heels

Perfect running shoe Very comfortable and fits well Love being active in these

This is a great great shoe and VERY comfortable it is a great workout shoe or just for a great casual wear

My son wanted these shoes and they are very comfortable lightweight and stylish

Most comfy shoes i have ever put on and i have wide feet

I love how light weight these are plus the overall comfort of these is top notch

The Nike Roshe One is becoming a staple in the modern wardrobe with it is breathable mesh upper comfortable Solarsoft sockliner and trendy runner midsole While the shoe does look like a running shoe I would not recommend doing anything in them besides walking or lightly working outwhile the mesh upper does provide ventilation and comfort it will not be able to withstand the stress that running or any other hard exercise can put on it The thin mesh upper will also be more susceptible to wear and tear when compared to traditional materials such as canvas or leather However I believe that it is a small price to pay for the excellent comfort and style that the Roshe One brings It is the best casual sneaker for its price on the market right now

Hold up well to the wear and tear a teenager puts on his sneakers

The color way is very nice on these shoes This is my first pair and I love them And they are affordable

very stylish and comfortable I where them everywhere Not very durable but a nice shoe to hang out in

I use these shoes as leisure shoes and I could not be happier with them They are very comfortable and supportive

These shoes are dope comfortable and very light weight I recommend these to anyone looking for something that goes with basically anything you feel like wearing

I bought these as running shoes that are durable enough to be ran in regularly and still be worn casually and they delivered They are super comfortable no matter how long I wear them and they look great I do not spend much on shoes but these were worth it

I just wanted a good pair of shoes that I could dance and work out in The sole is white so obviously can get dirty easily but that is how shoes are Definitely going to consider buying more Nike shoes

I love it Nike Roshe run

i bought some Roshes for work and they work great Good look good fit and they last

Excellent casual shoe for walking around the city

The Roshe One shoe is perfect for casual wear This is the second pair that I have bought this year The first pair have been very durable and they still look new You should order your usual size They are very comfortable I recommend the Villain Red color

It is comfortable easy to match clothes with fits just right and feel light

I brought these shoes for my brother as a birthday gift He loves them and uses them for everyday life not running or exercising They are stylish shoes and they match with every outfit

My son has the pickiest feet We struggle finding shoes that are comfortable on his feetRoscheare perfect for him

I just started working out about two weeks ago and when it is nice and comfortable running shoes These shoes were amazing they are extremely nice comfortable and stylish When I wear them I feel like I am not even wearing shoes and the really good for running I recommend these choose to anyone

As a track runner I bought these shoes to train for upcoming races I did not use these shoes to race instead I used Nike Spikes However while I was training these shoes made me develop severe shin splints Although I bought new Nike Flyknits for training to avoid anymore shin splints I still used it for everyday activities like walking with friends at the park

This product is very reliable and durable They are very comfortable for runs and also for everyday use I would highly recommend them

Initially it would seem this shoe is great for casual use but on your feet they are not comfortable My biggest concern is the upper I feel there is just too much room It is also is made of a material that is not too durable the fibers are prone to breakage very easily On your feet they do not look great either kind of chunky with an awkward silhouette You hear people say so many nice things about this shoe but honestly it does not live up to the hype

Love these shoes nice to wear on a casual school day

great shoe very comfy good cushioning Awesome shoe to have for the summer

Great shoe Very comfortable Can wear them with almost everything

Great shoe for just about anything Walking to class or working out

I used this product to run and they are very comfortable I also wore them to Disneyland and my feet did not ache that much Overall an amazing product and very likely to purchase again

I have tried using the Nike Free Runs but nothing compares to the Roshes I highly recomend these to anyone who runs or is constantly on their feet

They comfortably fit my feet the best I love them

This show is very comfortable and simple I use it mainly as a casual shoe not a running shoe because it lacks support and durability however I would recoomend this product to anyone looking for a comfortable shoe

This shoe is very comfortable to walk in It is a little bit wide in the toes but other than that it is amazing Finally it is reasonably priced and give short people like me a height boost which is nice

These shoe are nice and very comfortable also they do not get dirty easily

I have had these shoes since December and wore them a lot during school everyday I run often and they have been pretty good I see others have these shoes beat up with holes eventually after they get them but mine are fine I would get new ons probably after about 7 12 months of getting the first pair I run to train for soccer and I have ran about 15 miles so far this month in them and they feel good and work well I would recommend these shoes for either casual shoes or running they do good for both it is a very good shoe

The roshe run gives a lot of comfort like a running shoe But it is the ideal shoe for just walking and being on your feet all day and is a unique color

Ran a bit big maybe half size Love the fit Would buy them all

I will recommend this others

Love the flexibility of the shoe Allows my feet to breathe Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

This is a very good comfy shoe Very lightweight and goes with alot of outfits Breathable especially during the hot summer times Runs true to size so get whatever size you wear in sneakers

Very comfortable shoes and very stylish They are very light as well which makes it easy to run for long distances but I have some trouble trying to keep them clean Overall a great shoe and would definitely recommend them

Great shoe looks great with shorts and jeans I got a lot of compliments while warring these The insole is my only complaint It is a little harder than the normal Roshe Runs Took me awhile to get used to Overall great shoe I highly recommend it

This show is very comfortable to walk around in and occasionally run in I would not recommend running in these all the time because they are more meant for casual wear The design of the show is sleek and people will definitely compliment you on them A great durable shoe with style

perfect fit and color would recommend with any outfit and perfect for the gym

I mostly use this shoe as my every day comfort shoe They are the most comfortable Nike shoes that I have ever owned Definitely recommend for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet or walking around town more than the average person Great shoe for orthotics as well

As you walk run the pressure on your knees and feet is reduced tremendously and its just a comfortable fit

Ordered this item last week and received it within two business days Ordered a size 10 Wolf gray and could not be more pleased Great fit and feel to the shoe One of the more comfortable shoes I have purchased from Nike Love the look as it it not too fancy just a clean and classy looking shoe that you can wear for any occasion It does not feel like a running shoe as the material where the toes are does not seem to be super high quality for an extended period of running or fast movements The bottom of the shoe does get dirty but hey that is expected of a white bottom layer of a shoe Overall I would definitely recommend this for anyone that wants a great looking shoe that both fits well and is very comfortable

Overall amazing

These were for my teenager He loves them Very good shoe

I love my Roshes I use them almost every day and they seem to hold up pretty good You have to buy these

Perfect shoes to work out in Probably the most comfortable shoes I own

Great comfortable and worth the price Will get another pair soon

These shoes are all what someone would like in a shoes that is stylish comfortable and capable in using for athlete training As for myself I do not train in these I wear them for the looks and the comfort I could not be more satisfied Go buy yourself a pair of these

this product is great for Comfort And casual wear

Roshe Ones are one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn I do not use it for running just for hanging out and relaxing Great style and look Highly recommended

They are very comfortable Very reliable They have a nice clean look And also they are affordable I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone who is interested in a sporty shoe but can be used for an every day purpose

Lightweight breathable comfortable Everything you want in a running shoe might want to get half a size smaller they do stretch

This was one of the best shoes I ever purchased great fit very breathable and comfortable Only issue is the tend to get dirty a little easy but cleaning is easy

I use these shoes to train for football and track they are also great Weight training shoes

Ive been using this product now for about 1 Week and its been great This product is a overall big update to the original Roshe Run I run on a flat paved street and the comfort is amazing This product is a must BUY

Very good shoe very comfortable would definitely buy more

I love how lightweight these are They are the perfect summer shoes

my son loves them they are very comfy durable great shoes

Highly recommend gifting it to your significant other

I am not particularly a fan of the Roshebut the black looks really simple and sleek They are super comfortable but I would not wear them for any strenuous activities Size down a half from your usual Nike size

Love these shoes My son is very picky about his shoes and he loves these Thanks so much

NikeRoshe One running shoe is arguably the most popular running shoe today and with good reason After jogging with them on twice a day for one week they still looked almost new aside from the bottom of the shoe having dirt and other outdoor related marks on it But the shoe was easy to clean and after cleaning it the sole was as white as when I got it The shoe fits nice and is comfortable and the padded insole feels comfortable and natural to run in Even when I am not running I still find myself wearing these shoes around the house Overall a great shoe for almost anyone

I was not in love with these shoes for a while but my son talked me into getting a pair after having a few himself Now I love them so much that I have picked up 2 more at the mall last week Definitely recommend

This product is super comfortable and great for running it is also very stylish and looks great

These shoes are super light and very comfortable They fit perfect and i can get away with not tying the laces and not have to worry about them flopping around I got these shoes to be more of a casual shoe than shoes to workout in and i definitely to plan on buying another pair

This is the most comfortable shoe I have worn in a long time

Super comfortable great every day shoe to wear would not recommend running long distances in

Extremely comfortable sneaker Would definitely recommend

Most comfortable shoe period Fits most everyone due to stretch weave Awesome design and lightweight

I love running in these shoes they are very comfortable and help with my running

I strongly recommend it

This show is a must have Every step that you take feels like your walking on cushion and pure softness Your feet can finally breathe Its the most comfortable shoe and stylish show ever YOU NEED THIS SHOE

Worth the price Very comfortable Lacks a little durability

My son loved them they worked great for school He is a freshman

For the price and quality of the Roshe there is not much room to complain The comfort is really great and it is a sturdy shoe Be sure to buy a size down they run long You see them everywhere for a reason

When I first got them they did not seem like they would be comfy but somehow they actually are They are light but not durable my friends have them and rip them after a couple week be carefull

I bought this shoe for comfort by word of mouth Glad I did that I can walk all day in these and my feet will not hurt A must get

I love this shoes so much because it is comfy and durable I can not stop buying shoes from Nike because Nikeshoes alway meet my expectation

great shoes very comfortable Favorite shoes I have worn in a while Definitely buying another pair

can not beat the comfort and looks Great price too

These are great shoes Really good for running and walking The grey color is tough to keep clean but the while soles wipe off easily Highly recommended for everything but the hard to keep clean grey color Try them and you will not go back to your other shoes

This item is the most comfortable show that I have ever worn I highly recommend it to all Beware that the shoe is not crazy durable They can rip and get scuffed Just keep them clean and they are a wonderful shoe

Very Comfortable would definitely recommend to a friend

Great shoe looks and wears great Fits as it as advertisd

but overall would recommend them

Great design and comfortable to be working in even in 12 hour shifts at work Highly recommend this product for anyone

This review is slightly biased given the fact that I collect Roshes but I will do my best to review this product accurately This is the most simple shoe design that nike produces for a tennis shoe besides the SOCFLYs The Roshe one has a tighter weave in the toe box than its predecesor the Roshe Run This makes it a much more durable product and it keeps its shape much better than the originals I purchased the crimson orange colorway and i genuinely enjoy them The colors in the second generation line seem to be much more vibrant and creative than the last I WOULD NOT recommend these shoes for serious runners given the fact that their construction is much too simple and the sole is just one piece high density foam HOWEVER these shoes are perfect for weight training and I use them consistently everyday in the gym Overall the Roshe One is a fantastic shoe that looks great for the casual look as well as training

I love these shoes Comfy and super fly I am buyin all the colors

I have this shoe for looks but it feels great I would recommend this show for multiple reasons

I have 3 pair of roshes blue hyperfuse roshes red hyperfuse roshes and wolf grey and red roshes I think the shoes are comfortable and have a good look to them However if your are looking for a running shoe this is not the most durable shoe

These shoes are very comfortable and I will be buying other pairs

this shoe seems to fit perfect and I am always comfy in them the also look very good and are pretty easy to keep clean

Wear these shoes every day and have received multiple compliments on them The insoles feel great to walk on like a constant massage Great shoe and highly recommended

These shoes are great and are really comfy I can say I have no complaints besides the lower white parts of the shoe like these sides get dirty pretty quickly but are very easy to clean

Very fashionable lightweight and great heel support

These are good running shoes in my honest opinion

I really like how lightweight the shoe is It runs slightly wider than I am used to I purchased this as a casual wear shoe and I am not sure I would like it as a running shoe It does not seem built to give the support and fit to be great at that but it works well as a shoe to wear with jeans or shorts around town

This shoe is one of the most comfortable and supportive Nike Shoes I have worn and its surprisingly inexpensive compared to other Nike10 10 would buy a second pair

This show has a sock like feel and it is very light and extremely comfortable I would recommend to almost anybody

Shoe is comfortable The darker color is great Would recommend

I really like the shoe It fits very well easy to slip on and off just the way I need it to Very comfortable and looks great with any outfit

Sharply changing direction on concrete in Roshes are a bad idea I learned my lesson with my Mita Trainers Be careful where and how you run it is stability is also something i feel can be improved Overall they are a great casual sneaker I can not wait to try the Roshe NMthey look much more durable

I wear this show while running and it feels great It also looks great I wear it out sometimes and I get comments all the time Great product

do not hesitate if you are in the market for a new shoe

The shoe is one of the most comfortable types I have owned however depending on what you use them for they can tear pretty easily The shoes are made with little fabric which gives them the comfy feel but also makes them more susceptible to rips However I love the shoes I do not think you can go wrong buying the roshe runs

typically wear size 12 need to go 12 5 or 13 on these Little narrow at the toe Super light shoe with great comfort I would recommend this shoe to everyone

can not beat the og mesh roshe run err roshe one By far one of the most comfortable shoes ever

The Roshe is such lightweight and comfortable shoe It really has a great look and feel The material is one that will last a long time and unlike leather or suede it will never crease I do not plan on running in them but this will be a good shoe for the gym Also great for work if you are actively on your feet a lot I bought 3 different colors and I think I am about to ID a pair

I loved everything about the shoe the only thing that I was not so comfortable about was how big the bottom of the shoe was It was displeasing to the eye and just looked funny so I returned the item

Although I just received the shoe I like how comfortable it is and the support it offers Will use it primarily for a gym shoe and trail runs

Love these shoes Extremely comfortable casual and stylish to wear with any outfit However I would not endorse these shoes for running or physical activity

Very comfortable shoe and a great variety of colors but the shoe is not durable at all Within the first week of walking in them at school they started to rip After two weeks almost all of the traction on the bottom of the shoe was gone it was not visible After a good month of casual wear this shoe fell apart Very displeased

love these shoes in free time However the orange ones are kind of too bright in real life

wore it to the gym and felt very comfortable to my feet light as a feather

These shoes are the bomb period They look good and feel good cannot find a shoe as comfortable as this one

love these sneakers would recommend these very comfortable

I love the color and how fast I can run It is really durable and I really look good in them

i love the shoe the only thing that was bad about it is that I wish that it was more durable because if you handle them too rough the fabric will rip and I wish the shoe will have more traction but other than that a great shoe

Overall very happy with our purchase

I have many pairs of Nikes and I like these Whatever your running plans are these shoes will serve you well

Still love them Keeping me young Great colors too So comfortable from the start Just wish the soles were longer lasting

The shoes are amazing Very comfortable and fits you perfect

I do not run in these i wear them causually and the traction is smooth in 3 months also the very end of the shoe peels off The material is great

Shoes are stylish and comfortable for casual wear Colors are great

Perfect shoe for 2015 Light and comfortable but not gonna fall apart on you Very sleek simple and slim Bought in wolf grey sorta wish I bought a pair in black The grey is very nice but I feel the pull too much attention to my big feet 10 10 would purchase again

I just love this shoes is just great I can walk and run

I bought these mostly as casual sneaks Love how simple they are The mesh is super breathable in the front so my feet never feel hot walking around Definitely getting another pair so I have some color options

Great summer shoe Extremely comfortable and stylish Can dress them up or down depending on what your plans are

Shoe is durable and comfortable Gets the job done I recommend you go a size up but thats just personal preference 8 go with 9 ectThe outsole does get dirty easily but just scrub it out with an old toothbrush and you are good to go

NikeI am typically a size 10 10 5 normally a 10 5 most other shoe companies this shoe is very large I do not know if it is the color I got

These shoes are very comfortable and sharp looking I definitely recommend them

A soft and comfortable shoe from Nike as one would expect with this particular style My primary use for this sneaker is as a casual breathable lightweight shoe which qualifies for street style which I can use to dress down my travel attire when dashing around airports and on planes between cities for comfort I would use this shoe for city walking early morning light jogs and around the hotel gym Great to throw in a suitcase as they are not heavy and a go to when not wearing shoes and suits More comfortable than my staple of converse They are more appealing than serious running shoes tend to be

Just very good and durable I recommend it for anyone to be running for a period of time overall comfortable

The Roshe is a very comfortable shoe and it fits to your true size an i love the design of it

These shoes are stylish and comfortable and Nike Com makes it so easy to get them right at your house

A well manufactured product very comfortable Great for a casual setting walking and running

Most comfortable I have ever worn I have had them for just over a year now definitely getting another pair

This is a great product The only problem I would say is the upper part of the shoe seems a little sensitive It feels like it could break or rip easily it is a great running shoe or a style shoe it is comfortable yet a little tight I would rate this product a 4 5

casual workout run walk daily perfect comfort and style

I love the style and they are super comfortable Feels like you are walking on a cloud

I was hesitant buying these shoes because I knew I would not wear them to work out just as a casual day shoe Now I never want to take them off they are the most comfortable shoe I own and they look good with just about everything

Thanks for making such a great running sneaker I absolutely love them

Love the fit and comfort of this shoe More comfortable than the Air Max

I have wide feet like almost as wide as they are long This makes finding shoes that fit are comfortable and functional difficult to find

Definitely comfortable durability stylish and a great price

This shoe is a very comfortable shoe that is not very hard to clean Also it looks good 9 out of ten recomendation

Great shoes perfect width and size The most comfortable shoes without socks almost like a built in sock Very breathable and light Awesome shoes

Shoe is tremendous Great fit and comfort Outstanding value

Very comfortable shoes Has a sick style to the shoes The Rosheare the new style of shoes to wear Super breathable shoe to wear All in all love these shoes

My feet do not get trapped in the shoe I do not feel trapped in it When i run i feel nothing because its so light weight Thank you Nike

This shoe is perfect for me Very sleek design looks beautiful You can wear this to run to train or just casually It is a very simple and beautiful design I have more than one pair so many colors and options and flyknits also Perfect to wear with anything very versatile I would recommend the roshe to anyone

They are very comfortable I enjoy wearing them to walk in and just to wear everyday

Very fashionable and durable the shoe is very comfy

The nike roshe that I ordered are so clean They look better in person when you have them The shipping was fast and the shoe it self is very comfortable it goes good with mostly all of my clothes and I like the coloring of the shoe it is also very nice The nike roshe are what Ive been wearing a lot lately becuase they just have a good look to them and they never Get tiering

This shoe is great I am able to run in great comfort

These are by far the most comfortable sneakers I have ever purchased I also enjoy the slight increase in height they provide I played basketball in these shoes last night and they provided a lot of comfort and support I recommend these stylish shoes to anyone and everyone

Bought these shoes for my son who is extremely active They fit nicely and are so light weight great for action and warm weather I cannot speak yet to the durability as he just started wearing them but he absolutely loves them

Good stylish and comfortable shoe I wear these all day and they are very comfortable to wear

I like the product because it is nice on your feet

I love this shoe I would recommend this to any and everyone

I think that although I do not use these shoes primarily for running these shoes are great for it I use them for leisure and comfort and these shoes have not ever came close to letting me down in those category or in any other one for that matter

Bought this for my husband and he just love it Really light

Very comfortable shoe I would recommend it to anyone Great for cross training

This is my favorite pair of Nikes ever They are comfortable lightweight great cushion for running and they look so good I have recommended them to all my friends and I will definitely be buying more pairs of these in the near future

Great for walking and running I will be getting another pair

One of the most comfy running shoes i have every bought quality materials and durable

The shoe is a great fit and very comfortable I would highly recommend this shoe

I got the Roshe Run Hyperfuse black and pink and they are great They are extremely light and look great They run a little big so maybe go a half size down or so My only problem is that once you get dirt on them they are nearly impossible to get off so keep them clean

Good shoes for running it is so comfortable it feel like you are running bare foot and the good thing is they come with numerous colors to keep your style fresh Highly recommended you will not regret it

These are the most comfortable shoes ever you cn wear them wether ur running or not

Nice shoes Wear it all the time I probably will buy another pair

The Roshe is a very light weight comfortable shoe Very stylish and goes with almost any outfit can not wait for more colors to become available

Really comfortable shoes to wear in the gym or to go run

Great price Great shoes all I can said is that i got what I want when I need it

The best part of the shoe is the shoe it is self this is the first pair of Nike roshe I own and will be buy more The comfort is as good or better then the Nike free run The sole is what does it for me

Because we had purchased two pair of Roshe Runs previously I did not think there would be any problem with another pair However I have been extremely disappointed in the durability of this pair The other two were worn just as much yet this pair is flimsy and seems to cave in

Really confortable and good looking Wouldreccomend for anyone looking fpr a good proce shoes with comfort at the same time

These shoes are great even for training The only complaint I would have is that if you do weigh a bit more than a typical runner then the soles end up getting creased

Good shoe to wear shoe is comfortable can be use as a everyday shoe Tried this as a GYM shoe ummm I do not think I will be using this shoe as a gym shoe There is too much foot movement not enough support Overall love the shoe perfect when you want something simple light and good looking on your feet

I ordered these because I love the look and had hoped they would be as bright as they look in the photos They are I loved the color They run pretty narrow though I was not expecting the upper to be a mostly one piece construction with the tongue to be connected with the toe box and sides This caused the shoe to be too narrow for me and I had to return them I have the Roshe Sneakerboot and they fit perfectly and are the most comfortable shoes in my rotation

This product was true to size and navy color is the same as pictures here

I love this shoe it is lightweight and comfortable yet durable Highly recommend

I bought these not too long ago and they are absolutely stunning when I first received them I thought they looked great and very stylish Once I put them on they had great support and are very comfortable I do not actually use these to run but for everyday life they are awesome they can go with anything

very comfortable they are great for running every step is another second in heaven i really recommend these

Great shoe Very comfortable out of the box it is very light

The fabric upper just split This fabric is not durable

I love this product it has really been a great investment I have treated them mor as a lifestyle shoe and I love how comfortable they are Overall they have been extremely comfortable and are durable The color I got was vibrant and awesome

Shoes are awesome The sole was a little stiff at first but once you wear them a few times it fits to your foot perfectly I am on my second pair My first pair was mesh and the shoe started to fall apart after what appears to be a snag on the front of it And it just got worse and worse For the price these are definitely worth it and I plan to get more pairs in the future

I love these shoes they are super comfortable and I really love the color I always get compliments on them

Great color selection

These are really comfortable and light Material is light and soft I could be ripped very easily though

They are very comfortable They feel amazing They are also very light

This shoe is comfortable to walk in all day to go on a jog and to even ball in it is very easy to clean and you do not have to worry of creasing them Also it just looks like a sick shoe nice style

Overall a nice shoe to run in and comfortable

Broke this guys at a recent trip to the theme park was on my feet the whole day and did not feel any discomfort or pain at all Great for walking too

Let me first say I love the overall look and design of the Nike Roshe Run I own at least 6 8 pairs I have noticed recently on my newer pairs the insole has changed from the very comfortable rubber like insole of solar soft to a cloth insole that is the same as any other casual shoe The solar soft was what made this very simple shoe so comfortable and you could wear with or without socks I WILL NOT BUY ANY MORE ROSHE RUNS with the current insoles NIKE please bring back the non cloth roshe run insoles or at least give us an option to buy the original insoles again

These are amazing for once I found a shoe that I find a perfect fit to my feet I am in the marines and all we do is run in the mornings They look good fit great and they are super lite Highly recommended these kicks for the regular runner or for any sport

The shoes is comfterable but not durable I had theses shoes for a week and then mesh on the toe box already ripped and its not small it is a 2 inch rip not happy

Love these roshes and have already have had two pairs Just how your foot is not completely trapped in a shoe and the lightness and comfortable soles are great

I love the Roshe Run because they are light comfortable elegant and simple

All Around Great Colorway Very Comfortable And Light Weight

This is a great shoe for comfort but definitely not for running I have not run in this shoe before because I have a pair of Nike LunarGlide 4 and this does not even look like a running shoe The only reason I like this shoe is because it is very comfortable for my foot Two reasons I do not like this shoe are 1 You can not run with them and 2 The white sole gets dirty very quickly and does not seem durable if someone steps on your shoe or you scuff it

Ive had these shoes for less than a DAY Wore them to school and someone steps on them and it has this huge dirt mark on the toe Pretty dissapointed but great product thoughD

Let me start by stating I have 3 children and probably purchase 5 7 pairs of Nike shoes per year This does not include all the soccer cleats which are often Nike also Unfortunately these are the poorest quality athletic shoes I have ever purchased With in less than a month of use they developed the Roshe toe hole Turns out my sonfriends who bought these shoes all had the same issue Also the sole of the shoe is flat There is hardly anything left of it it is just gone I can not fathom why this company continues to sell these shoes They certainly are not athletic shoes Slippers maybe

My eighth grader wears these shoes for 2 months inside mostly since it is winter here in Ohio Was playing inside soccer and the ball must have had a piece sticking out and it ripped the shoe Being tennis shoes they should be more durable

I do not really think about writing reviews for something like sneakers but in this case I did The Roshe Run is a really peculiar type of sneaker

Most comfortable shoe I own Also very stylish and durable

I love the shoe It is very stylish comfortable breathable and can be used for many different purposes I would definitely recommend for style purposes Now When it comes to actually running and training Not so much I wore these shoes for about a month as shoe that I just used for style purposes and had only one problem which was how easily dirty the large white sole gets which is just expected so it is not a big deal One weekend I had them to train with and I used them They utterly failed on me and I am extremely disappointed that I must now go back and spend more money on another pair The top part of the left shoe toe box has a humongous rip down the center after only one day of running This hole is big enough to fix 2 fingers through Very Very Disappointed

I bought this product and it is great is awesome it has great features and the size is always perfect I loved it

The nike roshe run is overall a great sneaker with comfort in every step and breathability everywhere The only complaint I have is that they get dirty very fast If someone steps on them with a little dirt the shoe is stained immediately Still it is a great shoe for anything

So first of all I would like to say that I love the roshe run its a great shoe and its extremely comfortable however do not let the name get to you Its says roshe RUN but actually is not meant for running as the cushion is too stiff and not as soft If you use it correctly it can be a great shoe however after using it for around 3 months I realized that the stock insole is terrible It completely flattened out in the heel so it ends up folding up and getting really uncomfortable However you can always swap out the insoles for a better one I chose the free run insole but now I have to take them in and out so I can use my free runs as well Great shoe all nike has to fix is the terrible insole

As soon as I put on the shoes I could feel the comfort of the mesh Compared the janowski I would say the roshes have a better feel Not really made for running however they look great when you go out and dress casually

i love this shoe its very comfortable and comes in a lot of different and cool colors i use them day to day use and only to wear to school the only things i wish were better are the durability of the mesh upper and the waffle style outsole other than that it is a very good shoe i have had them for 5 months they havent ripped but the mesh has torn a little nothing major they just need to add more durability great shoe

This shoe was better than I expected These are my first Roshes Normally I get Nike FreeRuns but I thought I would try something new I do not regret getting these and recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of sneakers

I do not use this shoes for running i just wear them for school or when i go out plus they are very comfortable to wear i do not wear them for running cause i do not want them to rip

This is one of the coolest and most comfortable shoes I have ever worn but the out soles get super slippery after about two months of everyday use

I bought this shoe late this summer While its a very comfortable shoe to wear it is the cheapest made thing I have ever had on my foot I use these shoes strictly for casual wear every couple of days I wear them to school and they are falling apart The swoosh on the lateral side of the right shoe is falling off as well as the swoosh on the medial side of the left shoe The toe cap on the right shoe is coming off from the mesh and the mesh is starting to rip around the big toe area of the right shoe Like I said I use these strictly for casual wear and do not even use them every day I do not recommend them unless you only plan to have them for a month or two I did not plan for a mesh shoe to be durable but I also did not expect them to fall apart in all these places

These are legit the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn although the front part of them chipped

These Roshe Run shoes are amazing Very comfortable and just an all around great shoe

these shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn but they rip way too easily i was outside when i was running in the grass playing football with some friends and i tripped and the toe where the mesh is ripped

These shoes are the greatest shoe Nike has ever made Everyone loves their looks and they are sooo comfortable Not to mention they are very breathable and lightweight I use them in gym to train for Lacrosse and occasionally out and about I can not wait for the Flyknit to get back in stock I really want a pair They have a great price to quality ratio and I would recommend them to anyone regardless of purpose

Okay so i had the Roshe Runs for only about 2 months they are very comfortable and the Breathability is amazing They are very light and feel very nice on the foot

This shoe is great but it can not hold up very well They are very light weight and great for running

these shoes rip and tear very easily do not get me wrong these shoes are great shoes best part is they are comfortable but they rip and tear so easily i wish i could get my money back i had to pay for these my self and i do not have a job so it was hard to get and in the first couple weeks they ripped and the glue in the front of the shoe comes off very easily

Got a pair of these and they are decent the reason I am not sold is that the right shoe has a bump in the middle of the sole that is really annoying Left shoe does not have it I have changed out soles and the bump is still there Guessing it is a manufacturing defect

Yeah yeah they are comfortable not really but they have no traction and my feet are sliding around and my foot is leaning off the shoe They call it the roshe run but nike responds to customers saying oh they are called roshe run but despite the name they are for walking I have had them for 2 months and they already have a rip down the entire shoe Some advice is rename this stupid uncomfortable undurable shoe to something like roshe rip

good shoe but sadly they ripped when I was running I tripped and they ripped open on the side what do I do

Overall it is Good But When Wearing A Dark Colored Sock the color Rubs Off On The Sockliner And Makes It Look Dirty How Can I Clean The Sockliner

I have the marbles roshe run it is made of different material but still 10 10 comfortable the material is not as durable but I have wide feet and it ripped by my pinky toe I would defiantly recommend this shoe to another person

These shoes feel like socks they are very comfortable My only problem was a week or so after I got them they tore after kicking a soccer ball

These shoes have all the style and comfort to dress up or down I have not had these but a couple days so I can not comment about the durability They can be worn without socks but your feet better not be sweaty or else they can not slip on to good Overall great shoe

Got these in the mail a couple weeks ago and I fell in love They are exactly what I was looking for They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn They not only look great but they feel great too I very much recommend these kicks to everyone that is looking for a nice durable comfy shoe

I am not usually into running shoes but after looking around for the perfect one I came across these What first caught my attention was the look of the shoe nothing too FAR out thereit was simple and extremely nice looking I am a huge fan of the mesh part of the shoe allows for your feet to breathe through and the sole of the shoe is very comfortable as well I have tried this shoe with and without socks and either or is perfect I highly recommend this shoe if you are going out for a casual day or if you plan on working out This shoe is versatile and I love every part of it

These are the comfiest pair of shoes I have ever put my feet in If you are considering buying a pair I strongly recommend that you do They get a lot of looks and are something that you can wear year round I own 3 pairs and cannot wait for a 4th

I could be walking to the store or running laps on a track this product is comfortable and stylish as well

Super comfortable possibly my favorite since the NikeFree Great for a light run after work

Super comfy shoe for walking and casual use Now with all these different colors you can match with almost any attire Good shoe for after a gym workout as well The Roshes are really lightweight the mesh forms to your foot and the midsole gives a lot of comfort The simplicity of the design is what carries the style One big Nike swoosh is a nice focal point to the shoe Go buy one

These shoes are great for just walking or running and very stylish as well They are really comfortable and are gear shoes

Very comfortable and stylish too Would definitely recommend this shoe

Seeing these on the web store do not do them justice At first I always thought these were so ugly but then I decided to try a pair on at my local outlet and I was amazed at how good they actually look on foot do not hesitate on purchasing this shoe The price is amazing the comfort is incredible and the style is on point You will not regret spending the money

I recently bought myself a pair of these but the only true problem I have is the fact that whenever I try and put them on with socks of any kind or even without the insoles end up moving forward and putting my foot in an uncomfortable position Other than that the shoe is very comfortable but the insoles make it hard to put on the entire shoe

Really nice shoe Fit great as soon as I put it on which was nice I am not sure that it would be that good for running though cause it does not have much support

This shoe is just fantastic I am personally very destructive with shoes and these just seem to never fall apart and they feel great

Love the style and fit These are the best looking most comfortable shoes I own I would highly recommend these

My Roshe Runs fit perfectly on my feet They are very comfortable and let my feet breathe The mesh on the top is fairly durable and very light I definitely recommend this shoe

Great Shoes Very Comfortable for running and casual wear also

Nike should really consider changing the name of this product They should not be called roshe run but rather roshe walk I bought these shoes with the intention of running with them since the name implies that they are running shoes but after running in them twice a hole started forming in the toe area Apart from the shoe coming apart my knee also began hurting from running in these shoes I am very disappointed with this product and annoyed at the fact that I wasted money on this running shoe that can not really be used for running

Nike this a one of the greatest shoes I have ever purchased I have two pairs and hope to add to my collection the only complaint I have though is my white midsole getting dirty any suggestions on how to clean them

i got a pair of Roshe runs less then 2 months ago and they already are starting to fall apart as much as i love the shoes i wish they where more durable

My son has had these shoes for 1 week Just 1 week and they have a hole in them Granted he has not even worn them even 4 times School is out and he has not went anywhere to wear them He mostly wears his slides I would take them back but we bought them out of state and we do not have a Foot Locker near us These are made out of the poorest materials

Nike has made the best shoe I have ever worn or bought with the Roshe Run it is affordable very comfortable and most importantly extremely stylish These shoes are dope but in a very simple way They have a whole lot of color ways so there is something for everyone A must have for sneakerheads and just about everyone else as well Good work Dylan Raash Good work

I have not had these shoes for less than 3 months and they already are in terrible shape They tear so easily I am almost embarrassed to work out I love how they feel on my feet but I can not believe this shoe is selling so hard I have snags in my shoes and I do not even feel it when it happens I have never experienced this before with any Nike shoe and you guys have always been great on comfort and durability but I think you missed the durability when creating these I would not recommend this shoe at all Comfort is one thing but as a college athlete I need to know my shoes are durable

I love them they are very comfortable for everything not just for running you can use them for any occasion

Of all the shoes I have worn Roshes are one of the most combtrable of them all

These shoes are perfect for exercising or any activity you are doing Plus they are nice looking casual shoes that go good with pretty much any outfit They were made with crazy comfort and allow air flow which is especially needed for these hot summer days The only thing that may bother some people is how fast the bottom of the shoe gets personally it does not bother me I love these shoes and would recommend them to any one that asks me

These are shoes are the best shoes I have ever won They are very comfortable and durable They look great too you can never go wrong with Roshe runs they are the best

These shoes are very comfortable and also allow air flow The pavement gets hot on warm days and the shoes stays surprisingly cool compared to others

Awesome amazing shoes They are the best shoes I have ever had so I got some more

These are by far the most comfortable shoe that nike sells currently The only thing is that they get dirty on the bottom quick

By far the most comfortable shoe I put on before I tried my friendpair on and instantly liked them I love how comfortable the shoes are for casual wear but the only downside is that the bottoms of the shoe can easily get dirty and darken but are easily cleaned I would definitely recommend buying these

One of the most comfortable shoes I ever wore in my life amazing shoe expect the fact that the whole shoe is mesh which can tare quickly and the laces always untie I recommend that you buy flat laces

Nike Roshe Run NM is a very comfortable shoe which I can wear for running or for streetwear The shoe size fits perfectly With Nike Roshe Run NM your foot does not feel that free as with Nike Free Run 3 0 but it is still a very good shoe The material of shoe is durable

I love these shoes I do lightweight comfortable stylish but the only thing I do not like is that the bottom gets dirty pretty quick that is all I recommend these shoes but be careful cause they get dirty from the bottom pretty quick but pretty easy to clean so

I run on my schools track team and you can instantly feel the comfort and the price is good also my only complaint is the bottom has no traction and I slipped after I run my event but that the only complaint I have over all one of the best shoes out their

The shoe is greatcomfortable light as a feather good looking shoe and fairly cheap I wore them at first as casual then i started running in them After 3 weeks the toe area seems to stretch out which made the toe area very loose when running I would recommend something else if you are going to run in these Other than that the shoe is dope

This shoe is very Comfortable Nice sole feels real nice it bounces back pretty well nice and stylish as well

Overall a great shoe I would get this shoe for causal wear and not running Definitely recommend

This show has wonderful overall features I love the insole of the shoes Also very light and comfortable for all running or walking

Probably the most comfortable shoes I have worn plus a lot of ventilation

I have been looking for a sneaker that has it allcomfort style lightweight and cheap The Roshe Run is the combination of all of those I can not say there is a better shoe out now

This product is a very good casual shoe to wear everyday not the best for running though

favorite pair of roshe runs recommend them to everyone

i have over 10 pairs of roshes there is a reason for that Roshes are the most comfortable fashionable affordable shoes on nikeline right now Roshes are light weight easy to wash and very flexible

I love the shoe do not get me wrong but its not durable at all for my daily activities

I bought this as a gift it was a little small Still nice and he loved them

Very good shoe Durability is beautiful love the pink and all black Roshe 

I am not much of a runner but these are comfortable for everything I bike play basketball longboard and other things and these are good for whatever i do

Very comfortable Can walk for hours without hurting my feet

This shoe is absolutely perfect for school They are really comfortable and are true to size The only flaw is that if you step in a puddle your socks and feet will get soaked

This is my second pair of Roshe Runs and i have two pairs for a reason These are one of the most comfortable shoes my feet have ever been in The Roshes also have a very great variety of colorways The silhouette of the shoe is very clean and another good part of the shoe is that it is also very breathable because of the whole upper being a mesh material These run true to size and they fit well on my feet and i have wide feet so they conform to your feet how ever your foot shape is Overall I recommend the Roshe Run to anybody who needs a go to shoe to just slip on and go anywhere in style

Great shoe Would definatley recommend this product

The most comfartable shoes I have had with the weirdest doles you could imagine

This shoe is amazing very light weight and flexible Its like wanting on clouds

One of the best shoes that I have ever worn The siren red is the perfect color way and also is an easy shoe to just throw on and go

Shoe is very recommended Very light and can be worn for exercise or casually Looks good with pants shorts sweats you name it Comfort and stylish Love these shoes and I plan on getting more Buy these now

Feels great and very comfortable Will recommend to whoever and the price was a good price

I have two pairs of roshe runs and I love them These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I wear only Nikes and these are my favorite by far I strongly recommend these shoes for everyone

The Roshe Run is a very comfortable soft and a shoe that is also fashionable I would recommend this shoe to friends that want to improve their running style and to have a really nice shoe

I have been very pleased with nike recently easily my favorite brand

Comfortable Shoe

I have about 15 pairs of these Roshes I can tell you that I really do love the look and comfort of these shoes I only have experience with the OG mesh and 1 thing i can say is that they can shock you Like literally shock you I think its the fabric these are made out of For instance if its a dry day and you are wearing socks they are prone to shock people Also if you have worn out the bottom well enough they kind of start to lose their cushion and they start to lose traction on wet surfaces not like they had much grip in the first place It sounds like im bagging on these kicks but I really do love the fit comfort and look

They are so comfortable that I am now getting a different color every other week Love them

I have have many pairs of Roshe Runs but the next materials are my favorite Compared to the older models this shoe has an inner lining to keep your feet warm and the laces are thicker All around it is a very comfortable and durable shoe

I rolled my ankle cause the stupid outsole sits too high and the cloth has no durability

Great shoes not the best for running cause of the chunky sole but really good to just use as lesiure shoes

 Aaron

I already love Rosheand red is my favorite color so when this type of red released I had to get them

The roshe run is the best shoe ever created and it is very comfortable as well If you do not have a pair then you better be adding one to you are cart and checking out because you are missing out

Both pairs were for my son and he absolutely them

These shoes are incredibly comfortable Although it is generally true for Nike products the Roshe Runs are in my opinion particularly stylish

I have seen a lot of people with these and wanted to try them myself was not to impressed I prefer some of the older Freeto these Its an ok shoe but could be much better still Sending them back

These shoes are amazing everyone should try wearing these

This shoe is nice for just chillen out and staying comfortable I would not recommend it for running but I guess you can Overall good breathable shoe ohh and this shoe fits true to size trust me

I run a lot Almost 70 miles per week Would not recommend a Roshe for a run but when you are not running these shoes provide a great cushioning on those heels which is where most runners can get sore throughout the runs I also work 8 hour shifts at the Nike Store so these definitely help in a job that requires you to be on your feet all day

The are perhaps one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned They are like pillows for your feet as some say I highly recommend them if you want something you can walk in all day They are true to size and fit very well

I love these Roshes My boyfriend had bought me the neon cheetah print pair for my birthday They are so cute and comfortable I had to get him this pair for Christmas The suede is so nice he can wear these with jeans or to work out in Love the versatility and I am not one to wear Nike with denim These are a must have

These are probably one of the most comfortable shoes I have put on Great shoe and good price

This is an amazing shoe This has a lot of cushion which makes this shoe very comfortable

the roshe run is a great shoes but i do not like the fact that you can see your toes that is my only down side to the shoe but it is very comfy though

I have recently purchased a pair of Roshe running shoes and let me say I know now why everyone has a pair on their two feetI dedicated my self to getting fit by starting my new years resolution early I run an average of twenty to twenty five miles a day and my Roshe shoes do not hold me back My pair of Roshe shoes are perfect for whatever destination I choose to strive for Wether dirt grass or street Roshe shoes are perfect for whatever your into too Light on my feet cushion to great satisfaction and sleak unique design everyone should be blessed with a pair for the holidays Satisfying indeed thank you Nike

The Roshe runs were supplied in my local mall and i decided to try on a pair They were super comfortable and stylish so i bought a pair I bought the Split in Hero Blue and i love them

I got this shoe about two months ago in the bright blue color way When I first tried them on in the Nike store I instantly wanted to walk around the store with them they were that comfortable I bought them and now after having them for a couple of months they are still very comfortable and stylish and I get compliments all the time They are very breathable and light to walk and run in

I bought these for my 21 grandson he can not have them till Christmas but I had him try them on to make sure they were the right size and they were he liked them and if I let him he would of worn it right then and there It is the type of shoe that can be worn with a pair of kakhias well as jeans that is the best part

Very comfortable pair of shoes Wear them daily because of comfort and nice design

I absolutely love the Roshe run but I would really recommend that all sell it in bigger sizes because I wear a size 16 and can barely find a solid pair of running shoes and I am running out of options on finding shoes Please sell all of the Roshe runs in a 16 18 You sell those sizes in basketball shoes why not running shoesSo please please please sell those in bigger sizes but other than that fantastic shoe

SO COMFY And I love the style Really good value for the price I would definitely recommend them

This is the most comfortable sneaker I have owned While training for a sport this makes running much easier I would recommend this to anyone it is like wearing a sock but with all the support that you need Very easy to clean too

I purchased for my 14 yr old son who has been dying for a pair They are very light weight which is great for the distance he covers in a day walking through his high school I rated 4 stars only I am not sure how they will hold up

I am a girl who bought these menshoes because they did not have the same style in womenI wear them mainly for style but also as walking shoes They feel just as comfortable after 5 hours as they do when you first put them on Great shoe

I recommend these shoes because they are so comfortable They morph to your foot for great comfort

will be using this for just everyday easy and quick things

Not to sure if these are good running shoes because I am not an active runner but the are very comfortable These shoes are one of the lightest shoes I have ever worn If you want to buy these just to be stylish and also comfortable at the same time these are a must pickup

These are not for running these are for hanging out running errands and kicking rocks Awesome shoe

So with all this roshe run hype they are sold out everywhere I have been looking everywhere online and went to every store in existence near my location and it is sold out EVERYWHERE I actually got my hands on a pair after waiting literally months but they were not even the right size All that excitement into disappointment Just came back from my local mall to return them These are super ultra comfortable since I wore them for a day but I am DYING to actually own a pair that I am happy with

The roshe run is pretty light weight and comfortable Nice summer shoes Very breathable If you choose to run in these they will work fine too I mean you can run in almost any shoes But nice shoes in general

This is the best shoe I have ever worn It is very breathable and super comfortable It has come to be me do everything shoe since I can wear it casuall and it is quite stylish It fits totally true to size could not ask for a better product Thanks Nike

price is on point fit is very comfortable careful this shoe is addicting you get one pair next thing you know your second pair is on its way

So comfortable looks good its just amazing I love mine

The Roshe Run is one of my most comfortableand favorite shoe models from Nike can not wait to NikeiD a few pairs in the near future I LOVE NIKE

I do not run these were purchased to wear during work as I am on my feet all day These are extremely ventilated which is a plus for me Plenty of cushion they feel like I am wearing slippers Seriously if you do not have a pair of these in your life you are missing out

The most comfortable shoes ever Its like walking on clouds

Very lightweight almost forgot i had them on but very well extremely comfortable fits like a houseshoe you can wear casually The mesh is actually durable for you all wondering Now I can stand for hours at work and i work for this company

The new Nike Roshehave easily become my new favorite shoe They are very comfortable stylish and are relatively cheap compared to the Nike Freewhich USED to be my favorite I love these shoes all around and would definitely recommend them

I finally purchased a pair of Roshe on the suggestion of some friends and I was surprised at the overall light weight of the shoe and the overall comfort I personally wear them as a street casual shoe more than anything I probably would not suggest them for actual running or training I would leave that for either the my Free Run 3 or LunarEclipse 3 I have no complaints about the Roshe and would definitely get another pair or 2 in different colorways especially because of the relatively inexpensive price tag

Although it says run in its name I do not actually use this shoe to run but as my everyday casual shoe It is very comfortable and this is my second pair of roshe run in my possession I do not know how good this shoe will be to run in due to the lack of heel and arch support but I love this shoe regardless

After owning the original run of Roshes I knew Nike it the lotto with this design Extremely comfortable phylon sole breathable mesh and snug fit What more can one want I definitely recommend the Roshe Run to anyone Just beware I do NOT condone wearing them in the snow or on rainy days even though I have done so

I got this shoe primarily for casual wear and to go to the gym it works great So comfortable and light as a feather Overall awesome shoe

The shoe is amazing for the price also the versatility using it for all kinds of events A unique look that stands out Colors have contrast and its make a good eye catcher The only thing with me is the front toebox the rubber sole covering the mesh throws the whole thing off kinda making it look like a sore thumb thats the only flaw to this perfect shoe think about how it would look if it didnt have that rubber covering the toebox

This is my 2nd pair of Roshes and Its the most comfortable pair I own from Nike From the Gym to hanging out can not go wrong with its simplicity comfort and Zen like features that will surely keep heads turning

Comfort and price are amazing and the colors just keep getting better and the creativity in the new designs are great

I just got these and they are extremely comfortable and lightweight They have great breathability and flexibility and they seem pretty durable They are unique and are made out of a cool material I wish they had better traction though Overall they look and feel great and I would highly recommend this shoe for everyday use especially in the summer

Good shoes for everyday wear the lunarglide sole definitely makes them comfortable Just do not wear them in the rain

been hearing great things about this shoe finally picked up a pair and they are very cushioned and extremely comfortable and lightweight They are a great shoe for casual wear and for the summer Wish the platinum colorway did not sell out Great new shoe from Nike

Tremendously light Upper is a knit thus it gives a great deal and has a very free motion type feel Super comfortable and surprisingly well cushioned It does not appear in the picture to have great cushioning but it definitely does

Hello They are really cool Where can I buy them in Tallinn

If you are looking for a fire summer shoe this has to be it Size is true and looks great in that Sprite colorway

I stand on my feet while I am working and Im a plus size diva I absolutely love that the shoe is light weight and provides me with the support I need My husband is also wearing the same shoe to work and he loves them as well We are both on our 2nd pair

These are the first time trying the flyknit and I love them plus the color is very cool I followed the reviews and bough the size up and they fit perfect I normally wear a 10 and I bought the 11 and they fit perfect I highly recommend these shoes and a lot of the colors are on closeout so you can get a steal of a deal

Was excited to receive these for both casual wear and short races had a race upcoming I wanted to use them for Well Finish Line not only sent me the floor model but wrong sized shoes one was an 11 one was either a 10 or 10 5 To make matters worse I reached out several times and have still not heard back yet Buyer beware

Bought these for my son They are his favorite for track and cross country running

These shoes are the most comfortable running shoes I have owned I have only ever had Nike FlyKnits and these blow those out of the water comfort wise True to size highly recommend

These shoes took the top spot for the most comfortable shoe of the year for me passing the Vapormax Flyknit 2 This shoe is a must have

Very comfortable trainer that gives the UBs from 3 stripes a run for their money at a better price I have worn these for workouts tailgating and commuting and my feet are much better off for it These are probably my favorite sneakers to wear at the moment Cop if you can

I wanted to get a black and white pair but I got the blush pink because it looked so cute online Once I received it in the mail it was even cuter in person

These kicks These are very comfortable light weight responsive and fit like a glove But order a half up Like wearing a sock Walking on air

Purchased the blue and it is a unique look with a great pop of color Midsole is cushioned and supportive although not to the level of an Ultraboost better much better price point however Shoe wears well despite commentary indicating otherwise Runs a bit small order half size up

I see a lot of reviews saying they are tight around the ankle or snug of a fit Well just like compression clothes they are meant to form on your body Not every shoe is meant for everyone that is why you try them on and out These suit me for running and walking in cause they are light on the feet and the react sole feels good when running I do agree that the bottom sole has uneven wear like my foot is not hitting the ground evenly Prefer these over the vapormax for running and good for summer

I am a Nike guy I absolutely love the Lunar line of running shoes I also love the Odyssey React running shoes These Epic React shoes are just ridiculous I suggest purchasing an industrial strength shoe horn and some sort of lubricant if you plan on squeezing your feet into these bad boys Nike needs to nix the sock style running shoes and go back to shoes with a bigger opening for your foot to enter Crazy especially at the price point

If there was a rating less than one star it would be awarded here I do not know who designed this sneaker but unless you have an extra person around to help you you simply cannot get this show on easily There is barely enough room to slide your foot in The opening does not expand at all There is a pull tab on the back that is useless And if you have a bad back you had better pass on this sneaker these terrible sneakers will kill your back trying to get into them Awful sneaker

I went true to size and it was really hard to get my feet into the shoes I compared them to my other shoes and they are differently around half a size smaller length wise I ended up having to take out the insoles in order to wear them comfortably I have average width feet

First off I love the tech used in the REACT foam Great comfort from heel to toe 2 issues i had was the flynit was much to snug and wish they went a flywire route like in other runners and a complete outsole is much needed The sole start to click when the small outsole piece starts to separate from the react sole Comfort is great and actually recommend the Odyssey reacts over these

can not comment on long term durabilityjust wanted to chime in on a common misconception that seems to be shared btw a lot of the negative comments here regarding short term durability People are stating to have experienced extreme wear in parts of the sole with limited use

I bought these for training indoor running cardio and added them to my gym shoe rotation which consists of Free 5 0s Socflys Free Trainers Lunars Flyknit Racers and Metcons So far these Reacts have underwhelmed not because they are a bad shoe but because Frees are better in every way Frees are lighter more flexible more comfortable and cheaper Moreover the Reacts are not as comfortable as Adidas Boost for casual wear Overall not a bad shoe but I am going back to Frees from hereon

As an avid fan of the Adidas Ultra Boost I decided to get these as they seemed similar to the boost technology I can now say that these are one of the best Nike Shoes I have owned They are just as comfortable as the Adidas Ultraboost and seem to provide a more responsive feel I really do think that these will outlast the boost in terms of durability of the midsole On a final note I do recommend to go a half size up as my normal true to size was a bit too snug on my foot for my liking

I run on treadmill and it has been three weeks and i see wear tear on the sole already

Awesome show really awesome does not come in size 16 I bought a size 15 which is what I wear but the flyknit is extremely tight around my foot shoes are comfy but the fit hurts So I needed a 16 but do not have Wish they would make bigger

Oh and do not listen to all these other reviewers about going up a size you do not need to

While the flyknit material and the react foam are both very comfortable and surprisingly responsive compared to competitor options I have found several durability problems The react foam has started to make a squeaking sound on my right shoe even though I have read they have fixed that since my purchase date of this shoe The flyknit material has also strangely started to yellow and harden around the toe box area of the shoe making it far less comfortable and also aesthetically appealing as before I have only owned these shoes for about 5 months now and have mostly used it indoors for running on a treadmill so it saddens me that while my expectations were met and surpassed in the beginning they had these issues only 5 months into its ownership

These are super comfortable probably the most comfortable shoes I own I bought them for casual use since I do not run but I do a lot of walking and standing during the week since I go to college They run narrow and after standing around for a few hours I notice that the balls of my feet get sore but that happens with all my shoes These ones make the balls of my feet hurt way less and if I just walk around a bit the pain starts to go away Overall I recommend them at least for casual use but they are my new go to for when I am going to be wearing shoes for extended periods of time

I have not had a bad ankle sprain since high school but a couple weeks of wearing these and I have rolled my ankle several times and finally rolled it so bad I got a high ankle sprain These shoes look great but have absolutely zero support Never had this problem with Adidas NMD or Ultraboost

I bought the Epic React nearly as soon as it launched and for the most part loved it enough to order another pair I typically wear a size 12 and after a few workouts I developed a common tendonitis issue associated with a running shoe that is too tight This is common advice at this point but definitely order a half size up as I did with my second pair Additionally while the sock like fit is great it requires pulling the ankle ring in such a way that mine ripped off on both pairs while putting the shoe on All that said it is actually a fantastic running shoe especially when you get the size right that is comfortable and super fast for intermediate 3 7 mile runs I have yet to test it on anything beyond All issues aside I am honestly thinking about grabbing another pair yet and look forward to the second coming of this innovative running shoe

Easily the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I have 3 pairs of them The trade off of such a soft comfortable lightweight shoe is durability The soft soles render them disposable If your a daily runner be prepared to buy a new pair of these with every season

I have worn Ultra Boost for a few years so I was hesitant to try anything else as those shoes were amazingly comfortable React is simply on another level The responsiveness that is achieved with the React is 2x that of any other running shoe I have experienced Every time I go to put on this pair of shoes I am excited and to me that is worth every penny

Super comfortable to run in These are currently my go to training shoes and they have been great My only complaint is that the sole is showing excessive wear in the areas without rubber but that is the sacrifice for keeping the shoes light weight

I brought the NIKE Epic React for my training as well as for my marathon I was very pleased with the sneakers when I first started using them They feel very light and very responsive Love running in these but it appears that the foam does not last long enough and it looses its bounciness too quickly I was able to do two marathons on them back to back but I wish they had the same responsiveness they had when I first got them

I am excited for the next generation of epic react

I am torn on these shoes They are comfortable functional and look good The issue is they make a clicking sounds that comes from the front of the shoe I think this is based on the shape of the shoes and the engineering of the sole It literally clicks every step It is loud enough that MANY people have mentioned it to me Sounds like a small thing but after 5 6 people mention the clicking sound when you walk it gets on your nerves

there is a lot to like about the epic react Having run on all the other Nike running shoes with react foam and also wearing some shoes with react cushioning casually I feel confident in saying that the exposed foam on the sole and strategic cutouts do appear to make a difference in the comfort level by letting the foam expand as you make contact with the ground it is a very comfortable shoe for the amount of cushioning underneath Not too soft not too firm and it holds up nicely even during longer runs However just as a heads upit is not the best jack of all trades since it is not a shoe for faster tempos it is just not responsive enoughslow to moderate paces are its sweet spot There area few issue though The shoe is subpar when it comes to running in wet conditions because the rubber on the toe becomes slippery Having gone through three pairs already I also am not the biggest fan of the upper It starts out great but after 100 miles or so the shoes always got to the point where the area around the shoe eyelets would start to irritate the top of my feet I attribute this to the Flyknit breaking and and losing some of its structural rigidity and relying more on the laces for support But this was not a huge issue for me since the shoes were always resigned to easy and recovery runs by that point Durability was great and still felt comfortable even after 250 miles

As for durability the flyknit has been promising through everyday wear and a couple short mileage runs But the sole is almost work down to no traction It seems as if the toe and heal material used for the sole should be used throughout the entirety But the foam that runs under the arch is TOO lightweight that it simply disintegrates with every step taken on an abrasive surface concrete track etc Besides the durability issues this shoe is comfortable and stylish for the everyday wear Would not recommend for use of strictly a running shoe

I bought the Epic Reactin the wolf grey colorway back in may 2018 and it is been 4 months and the pull tab on the back of one of the shoes has already ripped I do not have super high expectations for shoes but i certainly expect more than 4 months of durability out of a performance Nike shoe at this pricepoint it is a shame as I really enjoyed wearing the epic reacts prior to this damage

Super comfy Squishy comfort but lacking in side to side stability This may be a good thing because to stay balanced especially when lifting weights your ankle is also strengthened

I love this shoe It has been great for training I have the Wolf Grey and a pink pair A very light and responsive shoe They have held up great on long runs The longest I have run in the is 15 miles Foot stayed cool My feet were sweating a lot due to humidity and they were soaked but they still were a comfortable fit

I was looking for a comfortable shoe to wear when I work on concrete It was all about cushion and this React cushion is awesome it is soft and allows me to walk stand on concrete for a long time The only negatives are manageableI had to go up a half size and I can not wear no show socks because the collar rubs my achilles

Best running shoe I ever had First time in my life I ran 10 miles straight without stopping it literally takes in all the shock from pounding on the concrete Great support and comfort I am gonna her another pair I bought the black and white pair I hope they come out with some better Colors

SO the shoe looks great and i know that the shoe runs small but the heel cup of the shoe digs up into the back of my ankle and after running only a mile my ankles are blistered up so as a person who has a wider foot maybe try these on thoroughly before you buy

I am not sure if Nike is trying to make mentoo narrow and womenwide to save money and build the shoe on the same platform but this shoe is way too narrow and tight I just do not get it I have a narrow foot and these are still too tight on my feet If you read reviews heed my advice and buy only if you have the narrowest foot on earth

These have a lot of cushion and are very responsive the flyknit upper fits like a glove I use mine in the gym and for road running after a few months of moderate use I use others shoes in between the soles have begun to show considerable signs of wear also the loops at the back that are used to pull the shoe on have burst on both shoes

it is am second Epic React Black same size 7 5 that comes with this strange popping noise like has some suction on the bottom Although I think does not affect the performance try to run 1 hour hearing it I do have a grey one as well actually before these black ones never had a problem I am going to number 3 hope this one is without this noise

I have a third pair in the box waiting their turn

By far the WORST pair of shoes I have ever purchased I have had them for a few months and the problems just continue to mount

Shoes are decent Worth the money maybe not I have some fs lites that do just as good for half the price The shoes are very comfortable but only running about 2 miles shows a little wear on the sole Overall I am pleased with the comfort and weight of the shoe but it is a tad bit pricey compared to shoes that perform just as well

I am coming off sports hernia surgery 10 days ago As you might expect my activity level is almost at zero I decided to buy these shoes prior to my procedure as a recovery gift to myself Just yesterday I broke them in doing some light multi directional stair work inside my house I must say that out of the box these shoes are the lightest most comfortable running shoes I have ever put on my feet When healthy I do most of my sprint specific cardio work outdoors on grass for which I utilize a few pairs of Nike Free shoes which are great and serve their purpose But for now as I begin my slow rehab process I will keep these shoes confined to indoor pursuits Comfort level is unsurpassed

Love the shoe love the fit and love the lookbut the shoe does not last I am a less than 10 miles a week runnermy focus is more on HITT weight lifting and sprints and wore down very quickly Very unfortunate I really enjoyed the shoe would not recommend to anyone or purchase again

This is probably my favorite shoe I have run in over the last several years Comfortable light responsive and my legs feel great after running in them Sadly I am just over 20 miles in and I can see the softer part of the sole starting to wear and scuff If I landed on the tips of my toes or my heal I would be fine but I am a mid foot striker and that is where the sole is showing wear This shoe would be perfect if the harder sole was extended about 2 inches on the front and an inch on the back I may return and try the Odyssey React or the Zoom Fly I really love these shoes though

This shoe is extremely comfortable and fits true to size the problem is the tread of the shoe Within 10 miles of running on the treadmill there are spots on the show where the tread has almost completely disappeared For the price of the shoe i was expecting a higher quality of material and for it to last longer than 10 miles The picture shows one of the several spots above and below the logo where the traction has almost completely disappeared If you are looking for a shoe to just wear around it would be great but if you want to run with it it is not a great shoe

3 Flyknit upper is very cool Shoe is very light and reminds me of the Hoka Clifton 1

First of all when I take a step on either shoe there is an unavoidable annoying clicking noise Second the heel is extremely uncomfortable I have had to start wearing band aids on my heels to avoid pain They also have given me blisters on my feet Bad product good idea terrible execution

If I were to order again I would go half a size up These shoes seem pretty decent for running but I decided with the Pegasus 35 There is little heel support and it just rubs against it unless you are wearing longer socks

I am giving these a five rating as they are the best runner I have purchased to date I am ready to look for my next pair

When I first took a look at the new Oreo epic reacts my first thoughts was to not give them a chance because I will be honest here I am an ultraboost type of guy But I decided I will try it since I loved the style When I first tried it on I was actually really surprised because they exceeded my expections on them and I was like wow what was I thinking about these new epic reacts So for the first 30 minutes of wearing them and running in them they were really nice to wear But once that 30 minute mark struck it was like I was walking on cardboard My foot started to hurt the whole entire day and on top of that the bottom and side of the sole is starting to fade away I just bought these shoes that day and problems had already started to occur with them I love the way you all thought about the style on them but the fact that it is fading away after I have worn them 3 times is a big concern

I expected the cushion to be softer Its much firmer than Lunarlon The upper is nice although I had to go half size up Not happy with this purchase at all

I have bought a few flyknit shoes in the past but never worked out for some reason This is the first flyknit shoe that I have bought that has worked out The only thing about these shoes I can complain about is the mid portion of the shoes are a little bit tight Hopefully a relacing and a little bit more break in will relieve this issue Plus I am questioning the long term durability if the exposed react foam but I am leaving that for another time Otherwise this is a very nice shoe and will find a spot in my running shoe rotation

Overall while these shoes are very comfortable and look awesome I feel like they are more for people who are interested in a fashionable everyday walking shoe as opposed to any serious runners

The toe box material and the way the toe box points upward has save me from the Black Toe issue The thick padded sole provides the shock protection to save on knee issues when running on pavement I am able to switch from fore foot ground strike to more towards the heel and mid foot big improvement in safer running

I have been running for 45 years Back when I started there were not a lot of options for running shoes I wore Nikes the Daybreak for many years I switched to a couple of different brands but never forgot the great way that Nikes felt I was excited to try the Epic React and was not disappointed They fit like a glove are so light and look great I hope to continue wearing these for many years

These shoes are super comfortable but the quality is not very good The foam where there is no rubber outsole has worn down pretty quickly and I only wear them casually

Not the best quality Bought these for my 13 year old son on a recent trip to London to take on a school trip He was gone a week and already had a hole in them Did not stand up to normal wear and tear

Love the shoe It looks good and feels good The stability is pretty good for a super soft feeling shoe and the grip on dry surfaces propels me when I am running but when the surface is WET the shoe LOSES ALL GRIP

By far the most comfortable sneaker I own They have been great whether I am running a few miles or walking through Disneyland The only flaw in my opinion is the visible durability of the sole Basically the sole looks like it has gotten more wear than what it actually feels like Then again the sole is really only visible when you are leaving people in the dust

I bought these shoes a couple of days ago I have only had the chance to run in them a once but I can tell that I am going to love these shoes The flyknit is a little tight at first but loosens up after a day or two This provides an excellent sock like feel They are surprisingly light and flexible I find most very cushioned shoes to feel sloppy These are not at all They are the perfect mix of cushion and support I can not speak to the durability due to the short time I have owned them but after a lot of the reviews I have seen on YouTube I am inclined to believe Nike when they say that the early wear is only cosmetic I can not wait to run in these again and again

This is currently my favorite Nike shoe React foam has been a game changer for me I am overweight and have a bad knee so I am not really a runner Walking is my preferred form of outdoor exercise But this shoe is so cushy and responsive that I find I can walk farther with enjoyment and without fatigue ANDthis is the amazing partit seems to be taking some of the load off my bad knee My knee has been less painful and more useful since I started wearing the Epic React I tried a pair of the Adidas Ultraboost when they came out and they are OK but React is noticeably better The Ultraboost is a little too pillowy for my taste while the React is cushy but also very stable This shoe is a BIG WIN

I have had my set of Epic Reacts for a few months now they have been my favorite shoe for distance running in quite some time Incredibly soft on landing yet responsive and speedy The shoes feel very light on your feet too They seem to run a bit small compared to other makes of running shoe if you are using them for more than 10 mile runs I would recommend a half size up

I love this shoe for running Looks good Feels even better But What is with the colorsWhen is pink and baby blue in the palette of a dude and who wears fatigue greenA lot of people like black white and grey but I am not one of them Whatever happened to Dark blueBurgundy redI almost bought another pair of shoes other than Nike for the first time I decided to buy the Vomero for the simple reason that it had colors that were palatable But if the colors are not better I will not be returning

Purchased a pair of these in the Cream colorway and love the bounce They are a little snug at the top to get your foot into but that adds to the stability once your foot is in I would go true to size or half a size up if you have wider feet Awesome shoe though

Light as a feather love this as I work on my feet in the salon all day I enjoy the firmness even thought it took me awhile to get used to this from my KMTR PRM This was the best flyknit technology I had felt to date but may award that to the Street Vapors I just purchased Even though I feel that both flyknits are different materials respectively the first being like the Classic Free Flyknit materials and the later feels like a ballistic nylon Both have superb lock down and have take flyknit to the next level I have the all white Platinum pair and have worn them for over a month getting them pretty dirty Cleaned them back to brand new status and my flyknit held up in the washing machine with a little bleach I am blown away as this even feels better than my Air Presto Ultra Flyknits Still springy and like feel of the bottom and like the surface contact The aesthetic is athletic and will catch eyes Let my roommate try them on and he is hooked If React is this good then what is Zoom XIMO Better than Boost any day but again I am bias

Great risk Nike for producing a Menpink shoe And in one of the best styles you have produced I have 5 pair of this shoe with another one on the way but love the pink style for something different Men can feel comfortable wearing and stepping out

These shoes provide great cushioning fantastic fit and great durability I log anywhere from 30 60 miles per week and use these for all types of runs long runs speedwork tempo runs etc I have logged over 400 miles on these shoes and they still have great bounce and feel fantastic I have already ordered pair2 I highly recommend them

Great shoe may want to order a half size up if you are planning on wearing for other than running Otherwise they are a snug true to size People seem to be unaware that the grooves on the sole have different depth out the box so they think that it is worn out the first time they are not it is a great shoe that is comfortable running in I usually run between 3 6 miles in them and the bounce does not fade

These shoes are really really comfortable but have some serious durability issues In less than a month the sole of the shoes were starting to wear out already

I immediately purchased 2 pairs when the Epic Reactwere released and after running less than 100 miles in one pair and 70 miles in the second pair have found them to be the least durable shoes I have ever had and have given them to a local charity that provides them to others in need The outsole immediately exhibits wear after even walking in the shoes for the first time and the first pair was almost completely bald after running about 80 miles Based on the light weight of the shoe I tried it for speed work at a track this was an unmitigated disaster as the laces kept coming undone I realize that the Epic React is not a firm shoe that would be ideal for doing speed workouts however I would have at least expected it to not come untied every lap around the track The only positive I can say is that it is comfortable for walking around in so if that is what you want the shoe for then so be it just do not start to try to run in it and you will be fine

Everything about the shoe is brilliant it is Flyknit upper is soft but firm and makes your foot feel secure the sole is bouncy and truly does make walking running a lot of fun I would wear this sneaker every day I would buy a pair in all my favorite color combos but I cant and its such a shame I can not wear them anymore because the POP from the outsole makes them unwearable I did not even feel comfortable exchanging them for another pair because others have claimed that the noise is prolific throughout virtually all the models Nike produced If they could somehow guarantee that they fixed the noise in a newer model I am back in but for now I have to retire them

Shoe is true to size I usually like to wear Nike socks while running so I went half a size up so I can have some wiggle room Very comfortable just like advertised I have ran in many Nike running shoes and I have to say this is one of the best so far The only complaint is the fact that just after one week of running I run around 30 miles a week the midsole is already wearing down This shoe will be short lived if you run a weekly mileage that is consistently above 20 30 miles Except for that this epic react shoe is truly amazing and lives true to its advertising Definitely recommend

The shoes are very comfy However the midsole started to have wrinkles on it after few days of using it Also the heel support is TOO stiff my heels got sore from it several times

I have ran in many different Nike Running shoes including the Free RNs LunarEpics and Pegasus The Nike Epic React just blew every other shoe out of my rotation The flyknit upper is a little snug at first but breaks in quickly and feels better after each and every run The REACT midsole is the craziest thing I have ever felt in a shoe It is soft and plush which provides comfort but also has a quick bounce that provides a nice springy response Like many people have said in previous reviews the OUTSOLE does wear very quickly as it is just exposed React foam HOWEVER after logging many miles in the shoe the cushion itself feels every bit as comfortable as it did when I first bought it The outsole may look ugly but it still feels just as good In contrast the cushion in a shoe like the Nike Lunar Epic very quickly wears out and the shoe feels dead and not as soft With the Nike Epic React I am positive that the cushion will as long as Nike claims it does despite not looking as pretty

I had very high hopes when I ordered these shoes The look is beautiful the fit is just right and the boost it gives you during your run is unmatched among any running shoe I have purchased before However the durability is almost the worst out of any shoe I have ever purchased I have taken them out on three runs so far about 10 miles total and already the bottoms are beginning to wear and tear it is unfortunate because this really is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn At my current running rate these shoes will not last more than a month though If they can fix the wear problem at the bottom of the shoe it would be the best shoe on the market

These would be the best running shoes on the market if the entire bottom was a thin rubber like the front and back

Wore it for the first time for a 3 mile run Came back and half the sole was already worn out Appalled by the quality for a rather expensive shoe from Nike Utterly gutted and disappointed as I hunted for this shoe in Singapore Taiwan and USA

I ordered a pair of these shoes after reading glowing reviews The shoes initially fit great and were super comfortable Unfortunately after a few runs I noticed that the shoes were starting to make a popping sound with every step I took It sounds like a tiny bubble is bursting in my shoe wherever I go it is great for letting people know I am nearbynot so great for doing almost anything else

Confused by the size up comment I have been running in Nike for years and I always wear a 10 5 Most recently in Zoom Vomero Flyknit LunarEpic and LunarEpic2 These things feel like they are going to fall off my feet I have to tie them so tight that I am starting to have some inflammation of the ligaments on my upper foot and the material under the laces is ruffling Bummed because i do like the ride of the shoe But sizing seems off

Bought these for casual use 20 miles in and the outsole is already trashed I have runners with over 200 miles that do not look this beat up it is a shame because it is a great looking comfortable sneaker

Got these as a gift and loved them so much After the first few wears a popping sound started to occur around the toes Extremely comfortable shoe Would love to get every pair if they did not have the popping sound Love the quality of the shoe Duration is a bit questionable thought Have only worn them in doors on the treadmill however I wear them casually and can see wear occurring on the soles very quickly

I had my heel pull tab rip I had my shoes for less than two weeks Very disappointed because the comfort is there

Definitely get half a size up I am usually 11 and I have a narrow foot but these were pretty tight even with me being narrow footed

I am a long time Nike wearer but am disappointed after only 30 miles of running in this shoe with durability of the sole Have run both indoors on treadmill and outdoors of equal miles and the soles are fraying and worn down to bare areas in some spots already I am not sure the foam without some sort of more durable outsole is going to be the answer Maybe it is the pair maybe it is me do not think I will be getting another pair of these in the future

6 2 230 muscular build So I play ball in Lebrons due to my size and the cushion system and I typically run in Adidas Boost so I figure to give these a shot due to the great marketing I can say they are way more comfortable to run in than boost however if you wear the flynit version do not do anything outside of running like cardio jumping etc because their is no lateral stability Since my workouts are dynamic I only wear the reacts to run in I wear another pair daily as my everyday shoe as they are comfortable But I can say on the road you get a lot of noticeable rebound so they do what they claim to do One thing I can not get past everything I touch I get shocked no matter the floor type Its the shoes I touched water running from the faucet SHOCKED cell phone SHOCKED people countertop cordless ANYTHING And because I wear them all day I am a walking ball of shock anxiety I now touch things with my elbow or other large part just to get rid of the charge first Its really bad I live in the NE so yes its dry hear this time of year but its only my Reacts any pair I put onno one is safe around me

My first run was incredible and I actually had a hard time keeping up with the speed of the shoes Now after running 4 5 days a week in them they seem to have lost their spring and the bottom is already starting to wear some of the groves out I wore the Nike Lunar Epic High for over a year and the sole still looks great but just a little dirty I sure wish Nike would consider bringing back the Lunar Epic High like they did with the Free runners I will be returning these shoes tomorrow and trying something else

These are the most comfortable lightest pair of sneakers I have yet to own Thought the LunarEpic Flynits were until I wore these A must have for Sneakerheads worldwide Aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and a match made in Heaven for the feet

First off I want to say I love the shoes and they are super comfortable

This was my first time trying on these shoes and they run small I really like the shoe I am hoping they come out with more since they sold out so fast

If your mid foot is kindda thick go 5 up from your normal size The shoes still feel snugged on the heels nonetheless Other than that no complaints

I recommend a 1 2 size US 1 size EU bigger and a pair of running socks to avoid blisters especially in those rainy days

The first thing you might notice is that if you have high arches you are going to have to do a lot of work to get this shoe on The tongue and body are or appear seamless so there is very little give around the arch Once on though it is like bouncing on a cloud I have only taken them on a few short runs but they are very comfortable

By the Nike gods I got the wolf greys today Tried them on at the store and never took them off Went straight to the gym and broke these puppies in Very comfortable and bouncy when running We will see how they feel in 30 days Happy running

I run 40 miles per week loved these right out the box felt snappy and helped get faster turnover vs other sneakers comparatively they felt similar to the 4 but after less than 100 miles the foam especially in the heels deteriorated see pic not sure running on the raw foam is a good idea despite the FAQs on this shoe foam from Nike seems to open the door to injuryor less good mechanicsso great shoe but not durable AT ALL I am going to give a new pair another shot maybe this was just a bad batch

Was waiting to get my hands on these shoes for months However unsure if its a manufacturers defect or design flaw but there is a loud click noise that happens with every step I had to stop wearing them in the office since everyone could hear me from down the hall and started to laugh at me with every step I took SAD

I got this shoes as soon as they came out Not only do they make an annoying click sound every step you take but they are not nearly as comfortable as Ultraboost or NB lazr foam I was quite disappointed in how uncomfortable these shoes ended up being since these were Nikes version of foam running shoes

The shoes is really light and comfortable when I have them on but I just having a hard time putting it on It runs narrow and tight plus my wide feet did not help either

I find these shoes to be a great for running but a manufacturing defect creates an annoying click noise with every step When I called the store the Nike employee knew what I was talking about so this problem is not just a one off I wanted to exchange for a new pair but they are out of stock At this sneaker price point I should have to deal with this annoying click

I am so happy I was able to get these Just wore the 1 day to workout and I already know they are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased I am not a runner by any means but as far as gym work and some cardio they are amazing I also purchased the Vapor Max 2 weeks ago which are also good but 2 totally different animals I am seriously thinking about getting another pair when they are back in stock If they hold for for a decent amount of time I will be even more happy I am 51 6 2 and I train hard every day Great job Nike

I have had these shoes for just over a month and have only run a little over 40 miles in them They are super light and comfortable I have run father and faster than I have run in any other shoe The soles are thick and comfy but they are not as durable as everyone makes them out to be With as little as I have run I have two spots on the soles of each shoe that are already heavily worn I guess its obvious where my feet strike I do not care though I will buy another pair when these wear out I really like them That is if I can find them in the color and size I like They seem to be flying off the shelf

Left shoe started making the popping noise everyone seems to be experiencing after 2 weeks I find it hard to believe the issue has been solved I have the new black white colorway There is a major defect with these shoes Now I am stuck dealing with lengthy hassle filled claim process I would prefer just a full refund so I can just buy another pair of Adidas nmd until Nike steps their game up Really disappointed Thought this was going to be a great shoe

I am a 60 year old who runs 25 miles a week I left Nike for Hoka two years ago to get the now trendy thick cushioning which helps with age I see the Epic is in that style and bought a pair I love them but the fam wears out REALLY fast I would say the tread has worn like the photo after no more than 50 miles run I will by another pair but its an expensive habit for this shoe

My husbands review will be next This is only my opinion as he loves his The sneakers are very trendy and look great on but it stops at that They were narrow and uncomfortable and I returned them 15 minutes after buying them I run competitively and for fun and didnt see them helping me in either situation

These sneakers are hands down the most comfortable even better than the Adidas Ultra Boost My only issue was the popping noise coming from the midsole and of course my size was out of stock so I am scrambling now trying to find my size ANYWHERE Come on Nike I need a new pair size 12

Shoes were great out of the box Instant comfort with very little break in time Very breathable and astetically pleasing Outsole is surpingly durable even though it does not look that it would be Show runs pretty snug so if you have wide feet I would say go 5 size up I also am having a weird popping noise come from my right shoe at random times It sounds like blowing a bubble with a piece of gum or something That would have to be my only complaint though I hope Nike can fix the popping problem because I hear a lot of people are having it If they can I will say this is probably the best running shoe Nike has ever constructed

I absolutely love running in the React but only while wearing headphones My left shoe constantly makes a popping sound and it drives me crazy I have also put about 100 miles in them and the center white tread has already worn down to a completely smooth surface making them slippery and dangerous to run in when it is wet outside Come on Nike you should have known this would happen with that material exposed The cushion comfort and energy return match the hype and wow they are light weight Hopefully they fix the flaws in version 2

I love these shoes First run in this shoe I ran 10 miles I have never ran 10 miles and it felt like I was running on a pillow The most comfortable shoe I have put on For sure worth getting

I loved these shoes great look and feel But after just a handful of uses both shoes are making a loud clicking or popping noise with every single step I have read it does not affect performance which might be true but it is annoying and embarrassing Also frustrating to have such a noticeable defect at this price point and this much hype

I have now been through 3 pairs of these shoes all of which developed an obnoxious cracking noise within days of ownership Would love to keep trying more pairs of these because of how comfortable they are but after battling with returns since their release date I am going to have to order a different shoe that can keep up for more than 20 miles on the road

Very light and fit tight for running but the two sides of my shoes and my girlfriend ones wore out pretty badly already I doubt it will survive for 10 runs

These are by far the best running shoes I have ever purchased it is like running on cloud so soft and gentle on your feet and knees I am going to get my second pairs just to make sure am not abusing this pair

After well over a hundred miles I can say these are superior running shoes that offer great comfort in a snug sock upper coupled to a cushioned base and durable sole They are light and very fast It was noticeable on the first mile of the first run that I was on an extraordinarily well designed shoe I have run in the rain in Seattle and they were not not slippery but hugged the ground No noticeable wear at all after over 100 miles none Nice looking but most importantly they are comfortable on short fast runs and long slow distance runs

First time to wear them and ran on a threadmill I put on 8miles with ease and I could put more mileage however I felt blister on the ball of my right foot when I got home I check on my shoes and was frustrated to see a lot scratches at the outer sole for running on a threadmilwhat more if I ran outside on the pavesomething that Nike team should figure out how to make them more durable on the upcoming version of the epic react

I bought these shoes thinking they would be extra comfort but find them to be pretty traditional for running shoes I think if someone is a heel striker this shoe does the trick I am more of a mid foot striker and I did not find much comfort The Zoom Fly I find to be more comfort and performance driven They are good looking shoes though

I had to control myself running in These I am currently running again after an Achilles injury that set me back for a month I normally run in the Clifton 3 from hoka but ever since the Clifton 4 came out nothing was the same I bought these along with the Clifton and tried a 4miler for each pair The epic react made me feel like running an 8 miler as to when I ran with the Clifton I was just thinking about running a 4mile I love the epic react one thing I would recommend is adding a few more holes for the laces to help provide a more secure fit for the ankle Other than that it is a fantastic shoe

I loved this shoe but I had to return them because of a factory defect They are very comfortable The outsole collects a lot of dirt very quickly The upper runs tight but you get used to it quick and they end up fitting very well

Buyer beware hopefully you are more fortunate then some of the other reviews like mine on here

I had two pairs of this shoe within 3 weeks and the same defect surfaced The show after approximately a week and an half develops a VERY noticeable clicking sound and feel with each step The second time I returned them the show salesman said let me guessthey click This is very disturbing since I have always been a Nike guy Now I am wearing an Adidas ultra boost due to this very real defect Come on Nike

After 2 hours of wearing my Left shoe is making a popping noise after each step It is loud especially when working nigbt shift at a hospital enough to get embarassed by coworkers and to wake up patients The comfort is amazing and very minimal heel slip but this defect needs to be addressed and fixed I will have to returm this pair unfortunately

Comfortable very light responsive fits perfectly I feel like a running ninja in these they are so quiet Scared people running up on them from behind Awesome shoe

Shoe makes a popping sound Was very excited when I placed the order because the look of the shoe is very innovative and creative But I was surprised to find they click with every step I take and can become extremely irritating not only to me but also my co workers I almost exchanged the pair for another hoping this was a defect of only a few pairs but most of my friends who purchased the same shoe have identical problemsnot to mention all the reviews on this page agree with this defect Nonetheless since I always buy Nike and stand up for the product I gave the brand the benefit of the doubt assuming the noise would subside with due time Unfortunately I should have taken advice from fellow friends because the problem is still consistent on a daily basis and is one of the reasons I am writing my first poor review Furthermore The shoe is expensive and I feel like I did not get what I paid for I am a loyal Nike member and customer so I am hoping the wonderful team assembled for which they call Customer Service can assist me in returning the product and get my money back in return I would share a video of the defective popping noise but I have no one to film me at this moment and trust me you would not want to hear it anyway mon Nike you can do better

I have been running for well over 20 years have been through all different brands of shoes most often have run in Brooks Glycerin and Ghost followed by Saucony in recent years ISO Triumph and most recently the Hoka Clifton 3 When the Epic Reacts came out I was really excited to give them a try as I was looking for a well cushioned shoe but one that did not look goofy like the Hoka The Epic Reacts have been a revelation Felt great right out of the box size was spot on I hate to say a snug fit but there is no slop so if you like a little wiggle room you may want to size up by a half But with the flyknit upper the shoe fits really well and the laces are only really needed if you want to cinch down any parts of the shoe to make it more secure The foam is amazing As cushioned as these shoes are they are not super soft which is actually a good thing I was afraid that they would be too soft and therefore transfer shock into my knees and hips So far the cushioning is spot on It really is more of a bounce feel than a cloud feel You get energy back when you run I have used them for speed workouts they are super lightweight and for training runs 7 miles was the longest so far and they felt great and they performed the same no matter what you are doing If they were not sold out I would be getting another pair just for casual wear and to rotate into my running I am imploring Nike to continue this shoe and do not get cute trying to change it it is great the way it is For people saying it is too narrow well you must have hobbit feet I like a lot of room in the toe box My Hokafelt just about right and they are WIDE and these shoes are perfectly fine The nice thing about the flyknit upper is that it really molds exactly to your foot For those complaining about the width I would suggest maybe trying a half size up As for the durability I have probably only done about 30 40 miles in them so far but I do not see any issues So many people referencing the wear I do not think realize that in some sections of the shoesole the grooves are already very shallow it is the way the shoe is made Maybe after a few more miles it will become an issue but for me they are fine so far If I can get 300 miles out of a pair I will not care because they feel great and every time I put them on i get that much more motivation to get out and go Unless the completely fall apart I would have to say that this is my all time favorite running shoe and I have been through a bunch

The description of the product is spot on with cushioning not compromising speed and responsiveness A couple of things to note A few reviewers have commented on the uncomfortable heel on first putting on the shoe but then that feeling disappearing once running u2026 They are spot on one moving these shoes are instantly comfortable I have struggle to find a Nike that fits since the 4 0s and these fit perfectly The final point focuses on the differing rubber on the sole at the toe and heel In the wet this stuff is slippery like Really slippery Especially on smoother bitumen and other artificial surfaces Too early to tell on durability but Nike have tested extensively and I trust their assessment

Shoe is very comfortable but the clicking sound that showed up in the right shoe after 2 days of wear was extremely annoying As with other reviews I also noticed the outsole prematurely wearing down Great looking shoe but disappointed

Most Nike shoes are narrow in the toe box These are too Great shoe Too narrow No dice

I used to run in the LunarEpics which were a great soft and light shoe The Epic Reactare noticeably better As soon as you put them on your feet feel the plush foam and lightweight properties immediately Immediately after trying them on I decided to take them for a run The springy feel often described in the advertisements is something you notice right away I ran through my neighborhood feeling the incredible bounce with each strike to the ground

First off I do see Nike responded to a reviewer with the same issue I am going to describe here Second this shoe is incredibly comfortable and performs incredibly well to the point they may take the place of my Vomeros and that is saying alot

I love this rubber shoes In fact i am buying one each for my wife and 3 kids The only problem i have encountered is the squeaking sound on the 2nd day of use I thought it was the uneven floor road so i tried walking running on my treadmill and i still hear the squeaking sound So i am returning my pair

Got myself a pair and was very excited to try these out next time i went for a run I had a great first experience with these shoes The shoes fit true to size for me and feel great on the foot However the next day i decided to wear them around casually and 10 minutes into walking in them i hear a popping noise very loud coming from both of the shoes I continued to walk around in them thinking it was something that just needed to be broken in but i was wrong still happening to this day I tried returning them to mall but could not because i already wore them to much Very disappointing because Im a huge fan of these shoes but have to put them back in the box for now

I purchased a pair of wolf greys the first day they were released in stores I have worn them a few days as a lifestyle show versus running performance but they are supremely lightweight and cushioned I thought ultraboost was as good as it gets but these truly give those a run for their money especially considering the weight differential I have not yet noticed the outsole wear that others have mentioned and am hoping that what Nikesaying it is more of an illusion and the foam will retain its integrity over time is true Ideally they would have a bit more grip on the outsole in the first place but that would of course add more weight Overall the react foam is extremely bouncy and comfortable the flyknit upper feels very thin sock like and ventilated and I think the silhouette is quite attractive They are a joy to put on and walk innicely done Nike

I was able to secure two pairs of this shoe One the all white blue accent heel and one the navy pink accent heel Comfort is amazing fit is great Durability is questionable due to minimal wear BIG PROBLEM THE CLICKING from the bottom of the shoe EVERY time I walk is terrible Completely unacceptable especially given the price point of this shoe and the fact that the one pair of ultra boost shoes I own have never given me this issue it is hard to continue to stay a loyal Nike customer when you receive the outcome I have with such a hyped shoe Disappointed as everything else is great

The Epic Reacts are incredible I have gone out on 2 long runs 18 and 21 miles and the shoes were everything they day they are and more Incredible comfort and energy return to make both runs my 2 fastest 18 runs I have done I have also run a few shorter runs faster than average in them Incredible shoe that lives up to the hype

The shoes themselves look greatthey have a slim profile and have a great bounce to them The shoe itself is narrow similar in width to the Flyknit Racers and more snug then I would want but it is manageable I unfortunately had an issue with my right pair making a clicking noise every time I apply pressure

I have worn the shoes maybe 5 times and they have developed a squeaking sound when walking I think it is because the blue portion of the shoes is a different material and not well connected it is a noticeably loud noise I would not recommend First time that something like that has happened to me and I buy 3 pairs of Nike a month

I was able to snag 2 pairs for the wife and I on the exclusive release date During the unbox I was very excited to see how lightweight the shoe is and general looks are outstanding Now lets get to the performance We spent the weekend in Las Vegas and these were the only pair of shoes I had brought I knew that we would be doing quite a bit of walking around so I was excited to test them out The cushioning is amazing The snug fit of the Flyknit is superb I enjoy having the compression style of fit Day 1 and 2 were great and my feet where happy until day 3 For some odd reason both shoes began to make this clicking sound as if there was something stuck to the bottom of the shoes This would only happen when rolling off the ball of your foot and onto your toes when taking steps I inspected the soles to find nothing out of the normal I did happen to see the excessive wear that had already began and noticed the foam sole sections starting to wear even past the depth of the groove To me this maybe questionable as to how long these shoes would actually last As for the clicking sound not sure if this is a defect perhaps incorrect fitNone the less I will be returning the shoes in hopes to find a better pair

These shoes were comfortable as soon as I put them on and stayed that way through the whole run They are very light and springy

I highly recommend this shoe for anyone It is a great running shoe and also looks great if you are just going to wear it casually The technology used is extremely comfortable for my long runs After 100 miles in these they feel just as cushioned and springy as they did straight out of the box

After abandoning Nike for almost 20 years they have finally put out a shoe that has brought me back This is so far a fantastic shoe for my training The question will be its durability over time I will be running two marathons this summer If it fails to live up to the hype for durability I will amend my review

I am beyond satisfied with the Nike Epic Reacti got my pair with the Nike members exclusive color way I ran with them for the first time 4 days ago and they are super comfortable and very responsive I am 5 9 175lbs little chubby haha run about 3 4 week and 3 miles every time I am at the start of having knee problems but running with the epic reactI do not feel the impact in my kneei prefer these over my Nike Air Zoom Vomero 12 great shoetoo but the reacthave more support cushion and responsive

I received my Nike pair and these are awesome after a day with them I can highly recommend them They provide great support and a very nice springy but solid feel One of the best new mainstream Nike runners in quite some time I would recommend a half size up from your normal shoe size

Great Shoe Will recommend this to my friends Thanks

I run about 10 miles a day and have been wearing these for a week now For me they have been responsive fast and comfortable A good addition to the arsenal

From the start I can say that these are beyond comfortable After using them for a few runs I can say they are responsive Coming from someone who have used the Lunar Epic I can also say that these are next level in comparison to previous models To summarize everything into one word EPIC

I was excited to receive an early pair I have been running with LunarGlides for years and these were noticeably springier They are light soft responsive and comfortable It was my first experience with flyknit upper and enjoyed that as well

I love this shoe I bought these as a gym track shoe and another pair of regular Pureboost as a recovery lifestyle shoe since I run so many miles These shoes started me on a serious Adidas kick and I hunted down the Ultraboost ST for my long mileage I LOVE the Pureboost RBL but there is one problem with them Ever since I have been running in them I have noticed a lot of friction at the front of my feet on the bottom The FLAT insole does not cup feet well and causes friction when I run I am also noticing arch pain I never had before running in these shoes I am pretty sure it is MY feet and these shoes being incompatible but I really like them so I am looking for a pair of Superfeet Insoles to help out

Feel good its light weight great color also feels good when I am walking or running

Flexible and comfortable locks in your heels nicely

Feels like you are walking on a little mattress It looks great

Comfortable Disappointed that the heel loop ripped off within 6 months of minimal wear Otherwise I would have rated them 5 stars

The running show is extremely comfortable and light weight Already ran a total of 30 miles and I am happy with my selectionquality running gear

It hurts my ancle and feet when I run and I think it is nor for running

They were exactly what I needed

I wear a size 11 Ultraboost and find the Pureboost RBLs to fit similarly I prefer these to the 2017 Pureboost and the Pureboost DPRs and actually prefer it to the Ultraboost due to the increased stability

Great support and comfort Not the best to play volleyball in but overall great

Secure confident fit Everyday comfort Lifestyle sport type shoe

This shoe is ultra comfortable and stylish one of the best shoes I have ever had

These shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever put on The shoe comes with so many good things just walking in them it feels like your walking on air because of how soft the sole is The material is very comfortable and flexes well for running and walking The only real con i found is that the shoe is a bit narrow at the end of the arch but still remains very comfortable as the material flexes enough that your foot can still go flat

Awesome shoe very comfortable and hugs your foot like a glove Will definitely purchase another pair

I like tis product because it has great arch support and good reflective lining around the shoe for when you are running or just wearing the she around town and they have a almost sock like fit where I do not even use the shoe laces Over all good shoe but runs a little big would getxc2 xbd down

I like this product because it is good looking and comfortable

The shoes came unraveled within 3 weeks of us ordering them

I purchased these for myself and they are feel and look great

The look is fantastic The feel is amazing Everything exceeded my expectations

First time with Adidas shoe that I had problems either the size it is too tight for size 10 that i usually order

this shoe is so comfy my feet fill free the knit dose well keeping everything together the grippy soles are a blast

could not wait to try these out when I got them It was raining on my first outing and am happy to say my feet stayed dry

I have always loved the air moneybut these are so dope plus they are part of the have a nike day line which I love they are comfortable and go with so many outfits

Nikes quality is on the decline I purchased the black colorway and when arrived there was visible glue all around the shoe This is an almost 200 shoe Is Nike trying to increase their profit margin by paying less for production control

I bought these shoes for my son who works in a lab and always on his feet It was a surprise for him and when he got it he was really happy for he said they are comfortable and stylish I bought him about 13 pairs of different shoes in 2 months and this is one of his favorites Thank you finishline

Me personally i LOVE style and i found these babies and i said Oh me Oh my put my hands on yo shoe sorry for the remix isa nevertheless these shoes are the BEST they are so comfortable and are amazing i feel like I am flying with these just watch out because these easy creese

I love the style of the shoe a lot and I like the design feature of the laces

I love these shoes I have the Black White and Black Black They both look amazing and feel great I truly hope they release an All Gray colorway as well as an Navy Blue colorway

updated shoes are more comfortable than the older ones

I just got these delivered yesterday and the quality is top notch Not too big or too narrow and the extra cushion from the insole is appreciated Plus the 3M design on the tongue has a nice shine effect in the sunlight These are now tied the Raging Bulls as my favorite 5of all time

The look is pretty good But a little bit tight It is better to go up half a size

Very nice shoes but tight on the toes Otherwise very comfy

Amazing shoe with great comfort all around A top brand specifically made for working hard and with great support around ankle And it was even better when getting a sweet deal with finishline

I love all things Project Rock had the black pair but bought the white ones for the deal I am nervous to wear them on a lot of days because they are white as can be Only issue I have is the sock liner loses its elasticity after a bunch of sweaty workouts

This shoe is super light I comfortable Great support and getting a 1 2 size or full size down is recommended I remember when The Rock was entertaining way back when before the movie Great shoes and 2 extra colors of laces came with mine I love options

My son wears a size 9 they fit great he has the black ones which are great for the fall weather He said they fit perfect and he had kind of wide feet and is on his feet all day

The shoe is well made and sturdy Nice and stylish and easy to clean Originally found the shoe for my son and found the very same style in a menGreat Pick

Loved the color and the style Just a little disappointed that these went on sale the next week Wish I would have waited

Man the memories I had when I played football in 5th grade in the cleat version of these here I am a Jordan Addict but these are my all time favorite shoes I remember Will Smith wearing them on Fresh Prince and John Wallace hoopin in them for Syracuse Every time they release I get the black white and volt color way This time I may double up though Now I just need the Zoom Turfs 96 and 97 Air Veer Pro Streak and Air Mission to release in the next couple of years

I really love these shoes however the pictures are deceiving I ordered the green and the black grey The green pair was a weird gun metal type of silver not grey and the raiders colored black grey does not have any white on the shoe like the pics might lead you to believe I guess I should read description closer and brush up on all the shades names of greys I returned the green and kept the black I love the cowboys giants the dolphins cw Ps nike please bring back the air barrage

Although they do run a little small I am glad I got them

This shoe has a nice design I enjoy the green color way and white I would like to see a red color

This shoe is very comfortable and has a decent look I also like the fit and durability of this shoe as well

this shoe is one of the best classics behind the diamond turf 2s i use to have all the shoes back then and this was one of my favorites they are very nice fit good have nice insole an outsole if your traning for football i would pefer these they give you a push in speed i just got them today best shoe ever

Well its about time I had these shoes back in 8th grade and honestly wore them for everything They lasted about 2 3 years of brutal use I wore a 10 5 back then and now a sz 11 5 and they feel true to size I had a little room in the 11 5 I could probably wear a sz 11 for right on snug fit but went with the 11 5 which I usually wear in Nikeand Air Jordans I absolutely love them I can not wait to purchase the other colors they have coming out Thank you Thank you Thank you Nike I have been waiting for this shoe for a long time PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Retro the Nike Air Mission Another Classic that has never been retroed Nike for life

I was greatly satisfied with my purchase I have had 3 pairs of Jordan slides before and these did not disappoint I knew what I wanted and I got exactly that I look fashionable and they feel great for what slides should be I would recommend them

These Are Comfortable soft on the inside they do not slide off your feet that easily great all around slides Would recommend buying these

You know they are winners when you can not wait to get home to slip in them They seem to be therapeutic comfortable and durable Highly recommended that you buy not one but 2 of them Not heavy nor too light make you feel like you gliding on ice

I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them They look very nice on him and he says they are comfortable I am glad I purchased

Really nice slipper use them all the time very comfortable and the inside of the strap is lined with swade

I purchased these slides for my son He loves them Very comfortable and durable

I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them She has not taken them off since we got them She loves the convenience and durability She also can not quit raving about how comfortable they are Great shoes

Not only do these slides look great but they feel great too Always slip these on after working out or after a long day at work Great product

These Jordan slides are excellent Comfortable durable and practical I wear them before and after playing basketball and softball and I always receive compliments on these shoes

I bought these for my 17 year son who is very fussy He lives in these sliders

Pretty comfortable overall but memory foam would probably be more comfortable Runs a little narrow size is true to fit

I bought these for my son and he loved them The red is not too bright and it matches great with all of his Chicago Bulls apparel Very comfortable and true to size

This is so far the best slides that i have And this is so confortable for my feet

The product looks great and is durable and also comfortable

Purchased for my guys and they love these slides I am told they are very soothing and look great too Very pleased these keep the guys from being cranky after being on their feet most of the day

Great slides I own the white and red and the red and black color ways Very comfortable and very easy to clean

Love them All my friends comment on them Wear them after playing basketball

It is pretty nice The logo is cool and it is comfortable to wear this

I ordered the shoes online They seem to narrow toward the toe more than I am used to with Nike shoes The size is fine but they just narrow down toward the toe too much If I had not worn them outside the first day I got them I would have exchanged them for something else They scuff easily as well The material they are made from make it easy to see the scuff marks

I have always worn Shox for the past 15 years and this is the first time that the sizing seemed to change

i love these shoes these are my fourth pair i have brought they are very comfortable great walking running are just hanging out

Good quality Nike running shoe I missed getting these back in College so when I seen them on sale it was must to COP

Takes a few days just like any other shoes to get comfortable

The size runs a little big and the material appears to be of a less quality than those made in China

I owned a pair of these and they were the best hope they never stop selling them

Overall I highly recommend

Got these because I loved my original R4s from 2002 Amazing comfort Feel great I think I got one of the last pairs in silver black red Look so amazing Love them Not sure about the durability A few minor creases and silver finish is a bit tough to keep clean Will see how they hold up Thanks Nike for retro ing these Hopefully you will bring back other great Shox models and keep releasing new ones

These are the greatest running shoes ever Nike is a great job inventing these and keeping the quality amazing

Pretty nice shoes the only thing one of them kinda narrow which never happened with me in bikes I hope it is will get better with the time passes

awesome sneaker I do not plain on changing styles anytime soon

could not locate these when they first came out so I had to get them this time around Very comfortable shocks really do have great impact absorption Run true to size not narrow Only had them a week but they seem like very durable shoes can not go wrong with these shoes

I have these and the all metallic silver ones and they are the best built longest lasting most Comfortable shox i have outta my 6 pair

I bought the Black and Red shox R4 i wish nike would bring them back they are definately the most comfortable shoxi have ever worn the only think i do not like about this shoe is that creases wrinkles in the toe box appear heavily but other than that these shoes are awesome

First off Im a size 13 I wish nike would make the shoe forever I have owned 6 different Shox but this one is the best by far I have really bad knees from football and volleyball and this shoe is the only shoe I can workout in it takes the pain away if I won the lottery I would buy 100 pairs

I am a woman who loves this shoe especially the all leather upper which allows me to walk or run in all kinds of weather My R4just wore out and I have used them to walk run off 40lbs Mine were white with the Platinum accents made in 2007 Now I cant find any in my size NIKE PLEASE BRING THEM BACK for Women too I have high arch my foot is wide across the front and a narrow heel These shoes just cradle my foot PLEASE BRING THEM BACK

My Shoes Fell APART IN 3 MONTHS

I used to have another pair of shox fleet and I loved them I like these even more Extremely comfortable and all around good shoe They might run a little wide for some but they fit me perfect

I have owned every pair thats come out since the original black and red ones

I already have a pair of the white with red shox R4 shoes and I absolutely love them I just ordered the Black with red Shox in early 2009 I can not believe that Nike has stopped production on these I have bought many many Nike shoes and the R4are the best Bring them back Nike

I have own more than 10 pair of Nike Shox and believe me they are a awesome shoe especially if you have knee and back problems I give them 10 stars Luv Ya I am a female but I wear the Men size due to the width being wider

I have recently purchased these shoes and i would have spent even more than what i spent on them they are by far the best shoe i have ever wore I was a little skepitial about spending 150 on some shoes but then i put them on and walked around i fell in love with them they form to my foot after about a week of use and they are very comfortable

I purchased these Nike shoes for my grandson His comment on how comfortable they are was They are the best he has ever worn He really likes them And has recommended them to all his friends

This shoe is very comfortable and great looking They draw attension everyone wants to know where i found them

To be honest this is one of the most comfortable shox ever The other would be Nike Shox Experience The only problem with the R4are that it is lacking breathability If it had that it would be perfect it is a little heavy but the performance makes up for it I too have plantar fasciitis and this is a great shoe for heel cushioning I still have the black red ones from 2001 and it has not been broken down yet Nike should always sell these because the first ones of its kind always prevail just like the Nike Shox Experience

I have plantar fascitis meaning pain on my feet Thus it is very difficult for me to find a shoe that doesnt make me feel pain This is an amazing shoe I started buyig it since it was launched in 2001 and nothing compares to it The R4 is expensive but it is the most comfortable In one word the best 

Bought these for my husband he has picky with sneakers but really these the style the color and very comfy

My son loved these shoes He said they were comfortable

These shoes look great and I really wanted to like them But they the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn It is like the out the arch support in the outside of your foot I have had these shoes for three days and can no longer wear them

These are great looking shoes I LOVE the design Nike got this and only this right I had these for less than a month and the right heel burst The shoes are basically unwearable now They feel totally uneven and make a ridiculous squishing sound from the air leaving the right heel cushion

I am writing this review in reference to another style of sequent I purchased 7 months ago but same heel Would not recommend buying My son wore for 6 short months and the bubble busted Now he sounds like he has walking on a busted air cushion with every step Have read other reviews this is quite common Come on Nike for the price they should last longer then 6 months

The shoe was extremely comfortable However when I tried to tighten the laces they came out of the anchor Attempting to thread the lace back through is impossible because the outer layer of the lace was shredding I thought it may have been a defect in that pair So I sent them back for another pair Same thing happened with pair number two

I will say at first it felt like it was tight on my heels This is the first time I have owned a true air with an air pocket and I think that is what presses in but overtime it feels like it has conformed to my feet I am very happy with this shoe and love the lacing system

I bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them size 10 and fit true to size He has a few different styles of Air Max but not these and they worked well He said they are comfortable

Super sexy I usually wear a 8 5 in mensizes but I ordered a 8 and fits perfectly This girl is happy Such a classic look

Got it for my nephew and he really loves it He wears it everyday

Obviously a classic silhouette that every person needs in their wardrobe Looks great on feet but do not expect any crazy amount of comfort Leather squeaked out of the box but lubrication solved the problem as well as breaking them in more Toe box creases easily so I would recommend purchasing crease guards as well Overall happy with my purchase

I also wish the mid had strapping like the high top Not a shoe you would where all day Heavy like Timberland boots

Never seen this style of Air force 1 I love them One word different

I have been a fan of Air Force 1since I was a teenager it is my only shoe of choice in the spring summer time I would definitely be ordering more

look great tops rub on my ankles a little but not unbearable

shoes are very comfortable great looking and love the olive green color Like always excelent quality materials

The green goes really well with jeans Wish the shoe came in a true high top rather mid It still turns heads when I wear them

The shoes came on time and were tagged the whole way with a tracking number had no probs getting to my house As far as the shoes the legion green pair were much more green than I thought they were but they are still an olive color They are made of a suede like material but it is not suede Good build quality and can match great with any camo army fit as well as anything olive colored I would recommend a bomber jacket to go with Other than that these shoes are a hit

They the best

Comfortable shoes classic mid design AF1 always deliver swag

He loves them and he is thinking about ordering more

I have got so many compliments about these shoes Foot action is the best to buy shoes from as well Their shipping is great and keep shoes protected as well

I bought these because I needed just a comfy pair of red shoes and I fell inlove with these shoes The suede really sets these part from any other forces in which I like There just a really good pair of shoes

Very Nice Shoe

Bought these shoes for my son last year and he loved them he was looking forward to getting the shoes again and we did he was very happy with them great shoes

Always a great sneaker was a awesome buy love the color and fit

I bought this shoe during the holiday sale so it was much cheaper and lead me to want it more When I first put it on I had a bit of trouble actually getting it on my foot And the super long laces that hang over your foot and to the ground are annoying but if you just tuck them it it is fine The shoe fit very comfortably once I got it on I do not want to say it was super small but I am usually a 8 and 1 2 and when I got these I had to get a size 9 so they were a little small for me Good shoe

I love the style of shoe but I would NEVER recommend purchasing from Finish Line It took 3 weeks and 7 phone calls before I actually received my order Never again will I purchase from Finish Line

What more can I say about a classicThem all suede ones are dope Like the fact the toe box did not crease on the first wear like the leather ones due I got a lot of nice comments about them

True to the era nice color scheme and style would buy two for next year

I bought these for my daughter because she love high tops She loves them Comfortable and stylish

Always been a fan since 6th grade back in the 90s and yrs later still sporting them my AIR FORCES

I got the AF1in the white cream for the low low I think I may have paid less than 50 for the joints I had a feeling they were going to be some type of suede material but it looks good of my feet it is a different color that I have not seen anyone else rockin so I am pleased with the purchase

If you were born in the 60or 70you remember when this shoe came along I was just in high school when Air Force Ones deputed This shoe and the color brings back memories and times I miss This shoe still relevant after all these years I am headed to 50 My grand kids kids rock AF1lol Cmon Man that is Killin the game

Thanks guys

First of all I ordered two pairs of kicks and only one came I ordered the AF1s for an event and lo and behold they did not show up in time because someone at Finish Line failed to put them in the shipping box ReallyAs for the shoe it is good looking but it rubs my ankle something fierce Maybe that will change during the break in period but for now it is annoyingly uncomfortable

I only received one shoes when my package came I am thinking about ordering my future shoes from another website

Nice shoe for a nice price thanks finishline for a great purchase

I bought the off white color because it was a deal I could not refuse Like them more than I thought I would as far as the color goes They are super comfortable also

Like these alot Very comfortable these fit perfect on my feet

True to size fit comfortable better looking in person Great deal on this site

I purchased the shoe for back to school for my son but I think I should have went up a size due to the shoe is very narrow He loves the shoe but it bulges on the sides due to the width of his feet He is only in middle school so I guess its ok for him

Fresh denimxc3 xa0nd gum bottoms Classic silouette updated materials yo

I bought a size 13 but really needed a 14 because this shoe runs very narrow I am happy with the style

i bought these for my little sister for school she loves them AF 1 is a classic shoe that will never go out of style

When these shoes arrived I was disappointed because I thought they were 100 leather But after stain guarding and wearing them I have come to really like them I get a lot of compliments and they feel great

Happy with my purchased the navy blue looks good with jeans

I just received this shoe today and when I first saw it it was beautiful let every smooth and clean apart from other shoes I have received from this company and when I went to put it on its was HARD like I left toke 30 mins to put both shoes on and yes I did lossen it up ALOT but once I got my feet in it was so comfortable but after 3 4 hours of wearing them they creased fast mostly on my left but still great shoe and highly recommend

now listen if you are a size 8 12 get a half size smaller or your feet will slide forward because of the half size love the shoe great foe a person with wide feet

Love the shoe came pretty fast people can not stop giving me compliments

These shoes look great and are very comfortable I have two pairs and i get compliments each time i wear them

Excellent shoes very comfortable but they run a size big I will probably buy more of these shoes

Thank you I love shopping with you guys for the family

Bought these shoes for my boyfriend as a birthday gift The colors add to the perfect style of these mids I love them in every color

The edges where the sole comes together with the shoe was poorly crafted You can see glue residue on it still I recommend buying in store you will be much happier

Quick delivery just in time for Christmas thank you finish line

Purchased these for my son and husband these are the only sneakers they will wear my god I was so happy the Finish Line came through for me just ordered my husband another pair for his birthday

I was highly satisfied with this purchase because growing up I wore high top air force one and they go with anything I got the all whites no long wait nice clean shoes but the size felt a little off the men11 seem a bit small frfr but overall satisfied will ship again easy process

My son picked them so I believe he liked it But did not I get my points for my rewards card

Great classic shoes and stylish Very comfortable

I bought them for my son for Christmas he loves them and they fit perfect

The Colors AreOn Point Too Sweet

I copped the AF1 in all black so I could have an all black pair of kicks True to size in fit Surprised that they actually feel like mid tops when they look like high tops Time to get a second colorway

can not go wrong with a pair of these one of the only brands I buy over and over Absolutely love them

Overall this is a great shoe The all white goes with just about anything I did have to go half a size down I wear a 10 5 and I had to get a 10 But these will never grow old Always love to Nike

In my search I put in Cleveland Browns shoes In the picture they appear to be brown and orange When in fact the ones I received are green Would have returned them but my son wanted them Nice shoe but wrong color do not trust the picture

Very Comfortable the white is a true VERY white awesome shoe

I do not choose any other shoe This is my favorite brand and style of shoe I have them in just about every color It fits true to size and these are very comfortable I highly recommend these Air Forces by Nike

Air Force Ones never go out of style and they ar an all around great quality shoe I been wearing them for decades

I recently purchased all white Air Force 1from Finish Line in early February Prior to purchasing them I had been looking for these shoes online and in stores for about 4 months Shoe stores either did not have my size or were sold out and online shoe stores sold them way over priced I had almost given up on my search when I discovered that Finish Line not only had Air Force 1in stock but had my size The shoes were also very affordable in comparison to other online stores that were selling them for 50 over Finishlineprice I instantly ordered them Anxious to receive the shoes I paid a little extra to receive them within a few days To my surprise Finishline delivered them very quickly and I received them sooner than expected I have had my shoes for over a month and really love them As Air Force 1have made a come back in the street style seen Ive received a lot of compliments on them and have been asked where I purchased them because a lot of cats have been looking to buy a pair also I live in Santa Cruz so the menshoe game is really limited At times I am skeptical about sharing where I ordered my shoes from out of fear that they will run out but at the end I recommend them to look at Finishline The quality is great and the fit is just right They are equally as comfortable as previous times that I have bought them I am sure once I wear these out I will buy some new ones

Nothing like the all white Air Force Mid but these are sick and go with everything

These are excellent shoes yes a little old school but I have bought atleast 4 pairs of these they are realy comfortable and stylish match almost anthing

Great classic shoe and the price was nice

I was not able to find this show in my size at the store so I was very happy to find it online and on sale Quality of the shoe is good fits true to size and they are comfortable shoes

Satisfied with a capitalMy son was happy and I was very pleased with price and service

The perfect all purpose shoe Looks good with anything and I mean anything Shorts Pants Jeans Dockers Anything

These shoes are swag tastic And I would know because I am the swagmaster They fit well and my feet are happy I named them my swagmisers The end

I have always baught the nike air force one it is a shoe that would never go out of style I like the way it looks and the comfort Nike always delivers

I got them a while ago and I love them they go with everything also they clean well but it did start to fall apart on me after about a year

Air Force 1are a timeless classic In terms of a basketball shoe the 31 year old technology is outdated for todaystandard Whereas as a casual shoe you can not really go wrong the shoes simple design can go with any outfit albeit shorts or jeans Color there are so many different colorways that you cannot find any color that will not matchup Over the years the leather quality has gone down a bit but the shoe is still very durable

I love them The price was awesome and they arrived wayyyy quicker than said That was also a huge plus Thanks Finish Line It is hard for me to get shoes in my size but I can always count on you guys to have just what I need without ridiculous prices and a long wait Quick service and great selection and prices

The shoes were shipped very fast The product is very good

This is a clean cut fresh air force 1 comforable fit and retro throwback styling everything I was lookin for and more

I love this shoe it is a classic

This is the most classical little white with no discounts forever but the most chasers The irresistible glamour of white makes the shoes easygoing with all other colors The modern sculpt of streamline allows the shoes to match all kinds of pants especially skinny and super skinny jeans Plus they are super comfortable which bring you a lightsome sense An absolute commendation

The material is so thin which is way different than my older pair which is not necessarily a bad thing but it fits weird around my lady area and gives me a saggy looking camel toe

Bought them for my wife and she loves them for bumming around the house Very light and comfortable

So soft and comfortable I wear them all the time True to size Definitely buying more of these

I like the leather and synthetic leather combination upper of the shoe since it is easy to clean The rubber cupsole construction is really good for flexible support when my daughter is walking and running plus the EVA foam sockliner provides lightweight cushioning The best part are the two hook and loop straps for each shoe

I went through a documentary about the Air Force and surprised the amount of technology that was put in to these shoes The athletes used to have 4 or 5 pairs of shoes to keep their feet not get injured until these shoes are introduced And the way Nike appreciated when the 3 amigos of Philly went to get these shoes are released again Shoe of the Month is a good concept and also 1700 varieties of Air Force shoes so far it speaks of its craze and durability

Very nice I would recommend getting a half size smaller

A very good and confortable shoe just feels weird in the sides but not to drastic

Love it buying all 3 this polo is stylish like tiger woods stuff from nike already have 3 getting all 3

Shipped very quickly Shoes true to size Look great with shorts

I only got a pair of these because I liked the color way After getting them and trying them on I was disappointed that they didnt fit I got my usual size but it seems with these I should have gone a half size down The one thing that was the most anoying thing about these shoes was the squeeking noise they made when walking in them with the strap tied down Im sure all the leather ones will have this problem

This product runs a bit narrow but hopefully after a few wears they will get broken in Awesome color ways and can wear with anything Thx Nike

It was a lot more narrow than I had anticipated but hopefully as I wear it more Ill break into them

I have been looking for a very long time to find a pair of shoes as beautiful as these Im still breaking them in but until thenthese shoes might not be the most comfortable They will be soon enough though

This product is very comfortable and fits true to size My personal experience with them was very good They can we worn tied and strapped or untied and unstrapped I personally liked to wear them untied and unstrapped but they are great either way The only problem I had with them was creasing They creased very easily

Really nice to wear and really comfortable I liked this product due to the style

I love these shoes Stylish and Comfortable I will highly recommend these shoes Wonderful Customer Service fast and free shipping Love It

Stylish shoes comfortable fit and holding up really well to almost daily use

Runs large I needed 1 2 size smallerSmooth fit comfortable

Not very comfy but stylish not a recommendation for everyday use I would buy a pair of air max next time for everyday wear

I love the style I will the other one the same style

The Air Force 1 Mid was purchased for reasons other then sports and training Its very comfortable and fits perfectly and goes with any outfit I put on Its a classic that I will always love

Comfortable and great looking shoe Would recommend product

I have been using Air force 1 since I was 12 now Im 26 and I always have a pair of white and a pair of black in my closet

I got these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved them they are comfortable and look really nice

Shipping was faster than I expected My fianc xc3 xa9 had his Birthday gift on time and he loved it with his new fit

I bought these shoes for my boyfriend and he is absolutely in love with them He also has black ones he says that they are fresh So after they do wear off i would go ahead and buy another pair Total he has had 3 pairs of these shoes So they are to die for he says really comfortable and great for style would definately recommend these to everyone

My son was very pleased with these as a Christmas gift

So far he lowes how they fit He had to wear them all Christmas day

You cant go wrong with any air force 1 The highs I feel are more popular nowadays but the mids have always been my favorite Look great with jeans and joggers

Get a size smaller than your original size like the low tops

Love these sneakers they are very comfortable very durable will recommend it to anyone wont be disappointed they great to match with anything and a classic sneaker all together its a must have if you a sneaker head

Air Force One has always had a great silhouette and is very comfortable All white shoe matches with everything you wear on a daily basis

Excellent show stylish comfortable exactly what my son was looking for

I order these shoes as a Christmas present for my oldest son and loves them I ordered on a Monday and received the shoes the next day I was impressed with good quality and efficient service Thank you

Its been so long since I got a pair of white air forces but they have always been so comfortable yes on recommending it to someone

Great looking shoe and is also very comfortable True to sizing and fitting

Great kicks love the style All family members own a pair

Finally got a pair of all white air forces and I love them Their fly and their comfortable They leave a little room on the side but barely any to make it feel weird Definitely would tell someone about buying these

I love these shoes The perfect shoe Love love

I love my air force one I get a pair every 6 months they are very stylish with jeans or shorts

This is a classic shoe This shoe is a must have for anyone who loves sneakers Nike has made a timeless shoe and at the price I should have bought more than 2 pair

This is my first pair of air forces and am very happy with the quality and fit Not to mention I was lucky enough to buy these on a day when they were on sale for 48o Nike for the hookup

The shoe is an icon you can wear it with anything and itll go great A must have You do have to take care of the shoe a bit more because it is an all white shoe tho True to size but if you have a wide foot I recommend a half size bigger Overall a must cop

love them Great fit I thought they would be bulky but they are not very happy with shipping as well Good Job NIke Thanks

go great with anything Good fit Highly recommend the shoes

These are the same classic shoes from way back They are the only pair I buy over and over again The only complaint I have about the Air Force 1 is they still crease badly in the toebox when you wear them the 1st time If Nike can come up with a way to fix that the shoe would get a five star rating

These are the best shoes ive ever bought I wouod reccomend them to every one

Love these shoes real nice and very comfortable too

Cant never go wrong with a white pair of kicks especially nike air force 1s mid Very comfortable and stylish shoe when going out Very durable and supportive when playing basketball Classic shoe and will never go out of style Really recommend this shoe

The Air force one is just a classic sneaker that will never go out of style

Ive been a huge fan of Air Force 1 especially in whiteout where it fits along everycloths also its so catchy to others from my experience if you once go Air Force you will go till it gets old meaning wearing this shoes is addicting

I love this product because if I choose to not strap the shoe it looks awesome and if I choose to strap it it still looks awesome

I love the color way the Crimson with the black and grey just pops The comfort is amazing like wearing a pair of slippers I highly recommend this shoe for everyday fashion AF 1 is a great shoe

Good shoes really comfortable and cool You will not be tired when walking with it

These shoes are some of the best they are amazing to wear due to them being able to go with anything you wear These fit true to size or a 5 size big Im a size 13 13 5 and I got a size 13 fits perfect I recommend these shoes to anyone who like Air Force 1s or just Nike in general

I run a lot in these shoes and these help me to stay in shape They came in shipping very fast and the box was hardly had a scratch on it They fit very nice and are a 10 10 I would definitely recommend these to my friends

Perfect fit Very Durable This shoe has swagger got a lot of compliments on it

I really love these shoes especially the color combination But the only problem I have with it is how norrow they are But i still love them great job Nike

I got the dark grey crimson black scheme The shoes look and feel great One small detail that is missing is that the metal AF1 tag does not come with this shoe

Nice color combination love the orange to red color on the bottom sole The black and grey compliment that orange red really nice These look very clean and crisp Very nice Air Force 1 Combo for sureo

Loving these shoes so far Fresh look comfortable and versatile Nike does not disappoint

I love the look of my Air Force 1 shoes They take me on a trip back in time These shoes are classics that stand the test of time

These shoes fit perfect and are very comfortable I feel like they will last for a while too

and I need new shoes for myself So this shoes is the best for me and I can anywhere with them

I have been wearing Air Force1 shoes for almost 25 years and each new pair is better than the last How does Nike sell so many when each product is more durable and longer lasting

Air Force Ones are a must have in every closet I love a fresh white pair and of course an all black pair as well Stop looking at them and buy them again

These go with all my outfits and i am considering buying more i would recommend these to anyone

I had these when I was younger Now they have the same great look while being more comfortable

The product came fast and it was exactly what i expected I really glad I I chose to order it frm nike com

I like the color way and fit you can never go wrong with air forces

Stay fresh sneakerheads

I use this shoe primarily at the gym for lifting weights performing cardio activities like cycling or rowing or shooting around on the basketball court I like the ankle support and the general comfort of the shoe

I have not yet worn this pair but have been buying Air Force 1 for work The excellant honey comb souls are great for my old tired feet This is my third pair which I will wear for casual Looking forward to first use

Classic design great for gym and everday use Have loved these shoes for awhile well built and never go out of style

Classic shoe As good they ever were Not for sports but great for casual wear

They are fit to run and durable even comfortable to wear And cool to even have a classic look

ALWAYS LOVED AIR FORCE 1 HAS A NICE BLEND OF AIR FORCE AND JORDAN 1 VERY ORIGINAL IDEA

Great shoes the color is great and it fits very good very comfortable

Classic shoe never goes out of style comfortable

These shoes are very comfortable and they also look great

Great product Tough durable shoe that will match with any outfit Great for a laid back casual look

By far the most comfortable best looking pair of shoes one can possibly procure There is NOTHING better than a fresh pair of Forces AF1 4 life

bought these shoes for my son and he LOVED them great looking and comfy

Nice gray color looks cool and is comfortable but I think it is little heavy

This is an amazing product high quality and super comfortable

I love the shoes they fit nice they look beautiful however I did not notice the manufacturer flaw on the side till after a few days wearing them there was some glue along both of the soles I am not too happy about

I love this Nike air force fits perfectly the colour is lovely will buy another colour in the same style

Good looking AF1 can not go wrong with these These go with anything

Great own 5 pair Will always get a pair each winter

I bought the AF1 in all white due to the fact that it is a great looking sneaker When I tried them on for the first time I also realized that they are pretty comfortable as well I do recommend that you get your true size though if you have especially wide feet then you may want to go a half size up

This Air Force 1 is so good and lots of my friends said it is really nice So I would recommend it to others Fashionable and comfortable nike is my favorite brand all over the world

The sneakers are very comfortable and stylish i will definitely order from here again

Recently purchased this shoes for a basket ball game I was going to play in Mexico the product arrived on time and the shoes performed very well on the court they have just the right amount of grip and protection to the ancle great product

great shoe overall very durable but runs a little big also it is a wider shoe than most so if you have wide feet this is good the only issue i have is that the cushioning feels minimal and my feet sometimes hurt at the end of the day but other than that they are great and are super swagg

this shoe is good but it gets dirty really quick and i liked it but not how it got dirty quick

They are durable comfortable and stylish but the only downside of them is that they look a little weird when you tie the laces or use the strap so I do not but I have to adjust the laces like every 5 minutes so they do not become TOO loose

I have not worn a pair of mid tops in about 7 or 8 years because I switched to lows due to more colors When I saw these at such a great price I could not turn them down AF1are a classic shoe that goes with just about any outfit

These af1are the freshest shoe i have ever owned They look sick with jeans and a polo Great shoe and also do not get soaked in the snow when your walking

This sneaker is made with TecTuff leather It is really comfortable and durable I have been wearing the old version for years But I have got to give it to NIKE they out did themselves with this one I recommend anyone who needs a sneaker whether for work play or just lounging The Air Force 1 Mid 07 Black is the way to go

These things look so fresh with jeans and Polo Just make sure they do not get dirtyy

i use this producte for basketball because of how durable it is and how buetifully comfortable it is

Sick shoes comfortable and so fresh had these shoes for monthes and didnt get dirty so naastty

these shoes are so durable and comfortable ive had mine for a year and they look brand new

THEse shoes arent very comfortable for me because i have really thin feet but they are so durable and comfortable and cheap

They look great and are very comfortbale The only knock is they crease easily but you can not do anything about that All that talk about buying Force Fields to keep them looking new is rubbish unless you buy a size bigger Do buy some water protector and spray the shoe lightly and evenly so your jeans do not bleed through Furthermore when you are not wearing them close the straps and pass baby wipes on the white part to keep them from going yellow on you

they are very comfortble i ware them all the time they are my favortive nikes

I bought these for my girlfriend She wanted to replace her old ones AF 1are classics and you can wear them with just about any sporty or casual attire Now I am waiting for her to by me some So love these and she loved getting the stark white brand new kicks in that sexy Nike box Ones are naturally stiff initailly but the soften up well and with good care are very comfy and long lasting

These shoes look awesome they are so comfortable and arent expensive Im excied that you can customize them now

My favorite shoes i have ever had they are very comfortable and i plan on buying a new pair ASAP

This is my first pair of Air Force 1 mid Black And they just came in about 30 mins ago And i absolutely love them Comfortable Just one minor detail Around the edges in the front were the sole is little glue is noticable if you look closely Besides that A1 PERFECT

anyone who loves shoes has got to have a pair of white AF these shoes keep it nuff said

They did not fit me I really liked them but had to send them back

just got mine today they look good in the box and on the feet look great got mine in black and yellow which is not an option for some reason really great price really great feel compared to my heavy air bagged basketball nikes

This is my second pair of Air Force 1 mids my first pair were the black on white colorway The white on whites are amazing you would be hard pressed to find a whiter pair of sneakers anywhere I would definetely recomend sneaker cleaner for these because almost immediately the mid sole starts to become dirty

VERY GOOD SHOE WORTH EVERY PENNY NEED MORE DISCOUNTS IN THE FUTURE

Cool shoes but I wish the laces are purple too but still awsome

these shoes are pimpin cant go wrong with forces except they crease way to fast got the white high tops which are beast

This is the most stylish gym shoe ever I have had countless boxes of Ones and I am never dissapointed Matches with almost anything and nothing looks better under the sunlight

classic pair of forces i have the black mids and white low top just dope pair of uptowns will never get old i have had several pairs of forces multi color air max forces but none can ever beat a pair of all black or all white air force 1matches everything only thing is they crease very easy but oh well still love them

These shoes are GREAT looking and the only bad thing abotu it is that it gets dirty too fast I have another pair of af1bt they are all white and they dirty REALLY fast

28 YEARS OF POPULARITY A TRUE LEGEND AWESOME BEST SNEAKER EVER BARNONE ALL WHITE WEAR IT UNLACED AND UNSTRAPPED WHEN THEY GET DIRTY RETIRE THEM TO THE OUTDOOR COURTS STRAPPED UP THEY HAVE GOOD SUPPORT AND VERY DURABLE OF COURSE THEY ARE HEAVY BUT EVERY SHOE LOVER SHOULD HAVE A CLEAN WHITE PAIR ALWAYS

All around good the only problem is that around the sole meeting the leather the glue they used is kinda visible so its like there is a white film runing along the shoe

i ordered a 9 5 and you gave me a size 10 and they do not fit too big

this shoes are really owesome i love them they look really good with big jeans they are not for sports they are havy but i love them

this shoes are classics now i know why so many people like them they look good and feel good

the all white forces are the way to go and they look even better in real life you will look fly in them no matter what

These are thegreatest shoes i have ever had They are really comfortable and look great Thank you nike for putting these on earth

i think that air fusions are the best shoes in the world and i hope that nike makes difernt types of color air fusion

Is it just me or are these shoes really heavy I am guessing its the way there supposed to be made But these shoes are comfortable and they look amazing in person Nice black with the yellow accent is a great color I would not think twice beofre buying these Great shoe

This is one of the most comfortable Nikes I have ever wore Besides the Zoom Air

I got these shoes like a week ago and they are still clean they are a very comftorble shoe and it is very durable it also has a great fit and runs big snd wide I hope you like this shoe

My son fell in love with these shoes He thinks they are the best he has ever had He runs through shoes really fast and these seem to be working better than the others he has tried

MY FAVORITE SHOES EVERRRR Great design awesome fit perfect shoe

I loved my product 1st pair of Air force 1s I ever got I love them and will cherish them as long as I have them

I got these shoes about two weeks ago I have gotten too excited and kept adjusting the strap on the shoe It is very comfortable and you can use it for just casual wear or for playing basketball The sole really helps you from slipping Leather is a cool material for a shoe Here are a few tips on keeping it looking like new

I am a huge fan of AF 1I hope NIke keeps the shoe for a long time with new colorways and of course the original white and black But this right here white black wow AMAZING

super comfortable only problem is that it does run a little large in length and width

I think its pretty cool and pretty confortable and slick and the design is awesome

these shoes are nice looking and the style is nice

These sneakers bring back memories man this is with out a doubt the best colorway for the airforce one mid These joints have not been out for years now and nike finally brought them back I have al ot of shoes and this tops everything

Being 6 10 and wearing size 20 shoes they are the best shoes I have ever worn Price is also decent

i love my AF1 midtops very comfortable and able to wear them all day with no issue

THESE SHOES ARE AMAZING OUT OF THE BOX BUT WHEN YOU have WORN THEM A GOOD MONTH THEY START TO WRINKLE AT THE TOES AND IF YOU WEAR JEANS LOTS THE JEANS WILL FADE ONTO THE SHOES OTHER THAN THAT THEIR REALLY GREAT SHOES

This is one of my favorite air fore shoes ever made the white and red go good together the red cement print part is also really tight everyone at my school loves them and wants to take them from me super fly and comfortable MUST HAVE

I think it suits for me there is no broken place but sometimes your products are a little dirty when they are shipped but it is okay Thank you

This shoe has got style performance and comfert its a must buy for EVERYONE

i just ordered these shoes a while ago and i love them cause the black and white ones go with everything no matter what you wear but the white ones look better Both of them can go with shorts pants dress pants jeans slacks pajama bottoms and etc but i have worn these shoes in the snow like a dummy but they havent faded or anything the black ones didnt get faded by the salt so i think these shoes are the real deal

they last a long time and they fit good They also were comfortable

These shoes are killin it with the ankle support the comfort and the white on white exterior Who cares if they get dirty magic eraser takes less than 1 minute for each shoe Its worth it Goes good with any clothing Buy Force Fields to stop from creasing though

there good shoes its just that they should drop the price a little and make them more durable overall there a good pair of sneakers

If King Arther was looking for a sneaker then he has found the true grail The Air Force 1 is truly that shoe I have been wearing these exclusively for the last 5 years and only regret not having started earlier The comfort is exceptional and the durability is fair Unlike a pair of running shoes these soles may not last as long but it wears in conjunction with the white fading There is something magical about breaking out a fresh pair with your favorite jeans and going out The heads start turning like you had Jessica Alba on your arm

I bought these white nike air force one mids about a month ago and they still look great I always have at least 10 pairs of all white sneakers in my closet because they really do go with everything These whites look good with anything from jeans to sweatpants to shorts They offer more support than the low tops and I think stand out more These air force ones are truly classics and everyone can wear them These white sneakers also look good with socks They go with any color which comes in handy for anything to baseball or football games I would highly recommend the all white nike af1to any one who wants a quality leather shoe that offers support versatility and style

these shoes are working great for me im playin basketball in them and going to school wearing these they are comfy and nice looking whether its with the velcro done or undone these things stay on my feet and are a joy

DateAugust 13 2008

To me these are elite air force cuz its not occasionally that they will make them like this

when i first saw dis fresh kicks i knew they were ill ive always tried to get an actual DECENT mids but these were just the right ones i loved it people loved it the neon yellow on the bottom is just fanatic and the black straps makes it stand out more than other plain kicks the design is mad nice and they are mad comfy worth every 9000 penny

I ordered these shoes because I collect exclusive shoes I like the colors and hope that Nike puts out more mid top exclusives

Great shoe for walking the mall in style They match everything just keep some instant shoe cleaner and a towel on hand they get dirty easily

these shoes get dirty fast and the stains do not come out

i think thy are a great fit for basketball and running

I got the Summit White Pure Platinum Gum Light Brown Black pair These shoes look fresh The only thing that is probably bad about them is that the bottom of the side wall do scratch up easily Other than that they are great

Wow Cool shoes 

Classic no matter what colorway you choose AF1 true comfort and timeless colors are hot

Amazing jacket I had my eyes on this windrunner for months Im a big guy 6ft 3 inches 290 300lbs I first bought this jacket in a 2xl which fit but was wayyyy to snug I made a mistake buying it in my regular hoodie size remember this jacket is lined on the interior and has a band at the bottom of the waist making it a slimmer fit if your a big guy get a size up even skinny guys look bad when this jacket is small on them get a size up and enjoy this jacket because its amazing

These are not comfortable at all it feels like the insole are made of plastic They are nice to look at and I see why they are seldom sold

Love it Recommend a bigger size than your usual size

I have had the same pair of shoes for about 3 years they have been through airports long walks skating long miles and early morning longboard sessions hikes even rivers definitely my favorite and most used pair of shoes I wear them 4 5 days a week they have left minimal blisters on the edges of my feet pinky toe area when they are in the multiple days of everywhere wear and they do trap in sweat but they are the best shoes I have had I have the all black suede pair and they get dirty easily after two to three wears they look dirty and dusty again but they clean up so easily they look clean over all When my pair finally did start cra ing the bed it was along the inner toe line just at the sole the bottom of the sole has always stayed in contact but the lining has come off and only come off further and further as time has gone by so if you are someone who sits on the edge of their seat and bends your toes beware lol I have slender feet and these seem to fit perfectly besides those rare skin blisters on the side i still choose to wear them over my other shoes even though the lining is definitely falling off they are nOt meant to be run in if i went running my shoe would fling across the room over all it is my favorite pair of shoes at the end of the day I am even thinking of rebuying in a different color to replace the old

I used this jacket as a postworkout and everyday wear jacket Fits well and is very comfy Despite this I folded the jacket and put it into my bag only to tear the jacket under the sleeve

I got the black with gum sole version about a month ago literally the best shoe I have ever bought I wear them for everything and so far they have held up way better than vans and maybe even better than converse I more use mine for biking than skateboarding but when I have been on a board they feel good Grip is fantastic

Read other reviews waited for a discount Cushion is nothing special Fit is good true to size only issue is some extra toe space Width adequate No cl and or uncomfortable feeling Zipper is not weak but I can see how if you do not stand and try to force it closed you could break it I give the shoe 3 stars overall Design gets a four execution gets a three If you are on the fence I would pass but I am not returning these

I am 5 8 and 155 lbs The size small fits me just perfect

I have been wearing forces for four years now and I love them The colorways are awesome They are also so comfortable and they last for so long

Shoes fit fine length wise but were extremely narrow I could barely fit my feet in them which is strange because I have never had any problems with the width of Nike shoes Beautiful design but would not recommend

Probably one of the best Jeter slogans since his retirement so my boys have 2 different colors and sizes but the biggest problem is the 100 cotton tshirt keeps shrinking Time to move it to a Dri Fit material

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wears jordans on a daily basis I am not a Training kind of person so I unfortunately do not know how these are for training but from what I have seen these are the most comfortable jordans I have ever bought The only downside I so far see is my feet getting very hot but that could just be me I hope your experience is as good as mine

Fist time i wore it it generated a lot of static taking it on and off can not imagine how it would have been running in that so ended up returning Maybe theres a good way to get rid of static permanently if anyone from Nike can recommend for the future that would be great

Everything about this boot is great except the ankle zip up design It is literally strangling my ankles so that hurt There is no reason a boot should hurt when you have them on Width is fine Going to return these asap

I like the way that Nike is willing to experiment with innovative designs I think this shoedesign could have been improved by performing more field testing before the design was released to the public

I love that these are a thing againI personally have the Now sold out Gray and Black combo and they are really well made my only issue is that I have had them for a little over a month now and the Air on the midsole has worn off

First I want to say this shoe looks amazing and is going to look awesome on the United States athletes in the Olympics

Love the look Love the comfort Absolutely despised the lacing system of these shoes I returned them after the second time I wore them

Great shoe and Love AF 1But the only problem i had with them is that the suede on the left shoe was little messed up but i still love the shoe so i kept it

Just got my AF 1 they are just perfect I will not change it for anything else

Not only is this great for those windy fall days but it feels great as well The first day I wore mine I got so many compliments from my friends I would highly recommend this windbreaker to anyone It goes great with some Nike shoes and Nike sweatpants I got the all black one and wear it with my black Nike sweatpants and black Nike shoes for a cool Nike outfit that will make you look fresh 100 of the time

This jacket is light weight true to size and very fashionable You can tell it is very good quality One of my favorite purchases from Nike for sure

I like this product the only thing is you have to wash regularly because the cuffs will get really dirty if not

Usually when I buy jackets a medium fits me a little on the tighter side and a large fits me a baggier I got a large windbreaker however it was not as baggy as expected so the sizing is a little off

This privacy is great It looks amazing and is great to wear everyday

The Nike Air Force brought back the feeling of wearing Nike in the good old days

Exactly what was expected Cant say anything negative about shoes

The greatest shoe of all time There is not a better silhouette then the Air Force 1 Versitile dress it up dress it down and ready at any time for a game on the court The hustlers shoe

This shoe is not only comfortable its also a shoe that will last the times with minimum maintenance The color waves of the new releases are dope I love my classics You got a customer for life in me

This is the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever put on my feet and they are very nice looking I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone but I only need to know what to clean them with

This is a great fitting shirt I wear it during football practice feel real good

I just got these shoes today and their so comfortable I love them and they remind me of the 12s its a great shoe and I would recommend

These shoes are great I have the red black one I only have one question how do you clean these because its a different fabric then the others and if you guys know any product please leave comment

Awesome shoe for an awesome price This show is very durable and stylish

I absolutely love this but seems to be a little short on the length and the neck hole is extremely big I have to wear an undershirt to make it look good Jordan Nike bringing more Re2pect Jeter stuff is awesome

This product has the best ankle support and the texture feels great theses are light weight and comfortable

This shoe has a great look to it Very comfortable but sizing is a little to big Overall I would recommend this shoe to a friend

Its great and recommend this product Please try it out The material has a pretty smooth feel to me Also the jacket is comfortable It also give you the stability and the mobility that you need when running or moving around throughout your day Enjoy

Love these shoes Great price great color way great style Bought two pairs other was the LV8 version Comfortable for everyday wear

I bought these as a gift for my son in law and he loves them They are very nice looking shoes and very comfortable Well done Nike

Comfort like no other they take about 3 wears to break in but the comfort level is amazing

I have been playing basketball my whole life im 51yrs old These are by far the best sneakers for me full lenght air sole unit for maxium cushing and great ankle support with velcro strap I feel real safe in these sneakers

I really like this product but I would definetly go one size up

This product is light durable and stylish It fits and performs as expected Pricey but the quality is tremendous

The shoes are great They have a comfortable feel and are just simple

I have never had any sizing issues from Nike I always get my same size and they have always fit right The Janoski line are way too narrow for wide footers and they pinch the sides of my foot to where it is too painful to wear these shoes I read the reviews and gave them about 2 months to stretch out and it did but slightly I ended up going half a size up Still a little narrow but at least it is no longer painful to walk in them Other than the shoe being too narrow overall the shoe was fine

My buddy had a pair of Janoskis and I really liked them I found these and decided I wanted to buy them I have had them for about 3 months and they now have a tear on the inner right foot I was planning on using them for skating after wearing them for a while but they did not even last to that point I was really disappointed in the fact that they did not last at all and that there is no real way to contact Nike specifically about this topic

This jacket looks awesome and is super comfortable to wear However I was out in some moderately heavy rain today assuming that this would repel the water I was wrong After 10 minutes in the rain the water had soaked through the coat and all over my shirt Really wish they had made the material completely waterproof as the look suggests

shoes fit great and are real comfortable highly recommend

The material is comfortable and fits me perfectly This is probably my third windrunner jacket The previous two have held up great One is ten years old and still looks good The issue with this new jacket is with the sleeve cuffs Moreover they are cheap They fold and bunch up and have a really bad pilling effect I do not even wear it anymore because the sleeves make the rest of the jacket look old I would have never thought the screen printed Nike logo would outlast the sleeve cuff

I normally buy the mids so I figured I would give these a try I love them I took the loops off though felt like I would get them caught on something but the structure is good good support on my ankles and comfortable insoles Wish they would be raw denim stain resistant

I love these shoes good quality and design make me look taller too

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in fact I have now bought three pairs of them

I skate about 2 3 times a week and so far they have held together very good I have had them for about a month The material has held up really well

I love this jacket it is super versatile and great for before and after workouts The colorblocking is always on point there is one stupid flaw thoughthat little flap at the top of the zipper For some reason this piece of material exists and it ALWAYS gets stuck in my zipper when I pull it up I am not sure what the purpose is other than to annoy me but I would really love to know Other than that would buy again and probably will I already have 2

I love the shoes so much So simple and comfortable

First off I love this jacket it is light durable and fits well I am 5 8 and 130 pounds I bought a medium and it was great The fact of the matter isI was disappointed that there was not a palm green option I love the color and it is kinda my thing with Nike gear If you all at Nike could make this happen I would be in love with this awesome jacket even more

I got this jacket a few months back and Ive been very happy with it Ordered a medium and it fit great true to size The material feels amazing and is very light weight but still keeps you warm in cold weather So far it has proven to be durable and held up to wear Solid purchase for anyone looking to swoop one up

These are very high quality shoes There are so many colors to choose from which is good for all different types of people personalities and interests The shoe is also very neutral which means it could be worn with all types of clothing and can be matched with any shirt and pants combo The price is also very good and affordable They can be purchased by anyone and worn forever The material quality is very high which gives off a very unique smooth look There are different types of material it is made from such as suede cloth and leather It gives off a great stylish comfortable and smooth look I own many types of these shoes and I have for years The selection of shoe types is very good Hi Air Force One shoes Mid Air Force One shoes and Low Air Force One shoes They also can be worn by all ages Kids Teens and Adults They are made to worn by both genders male and female These are are a great product to buy and are worth a shot I have worn these for years and they are made to be worn by anyone looking for a classic comfortable shoe I plan to buy plenty pairs in the future I recommend these shoes to anyone who wants to wear shoes and give off a very smooth and stylish look and also does not want to spend an outrageous amount of money while doing so

my son says they are comfortable

I love this shoe but can not recommend it since the material shon after a few months begins to form holes I wear the shoe every day but mostly only inside The material is simply not suitable for a shoe and that is a real shame because the shoe is just great

Great looking and comfortable shoe for everyday wear or the gym Waiting for more colorways

I purchased these shoes a few months back and left them in the box without bothering to try them on I frequently purchase items to leave on deck for when I feel the need for them Having said that I have been buying size 12 Nikes of all types every year since 1994 Well when I decided to open these up and put them on the experience was maddening they are insanely narrow and theres no way to get them on my feet Ive never in my life had a problem like this with any shoe and I do not have wide feet I have high end dress shoes and have always measured to a 12 would so I gave no idea whats going on with these At this point I do not even know what to do with the shoes

Love the shoes can not wait to more colors come out feet

I bought this jacket a few months ago and absolutely love it I have since bought 2 other colors because I have enjoyed it so much Very comfortable and light weight so it does not restrict in any of my movements This jacket is perfect for any activity I could not be happier and would recommend this to ANYONE

Bought this jacket for the looks totally recommend Its light and stylish It runs a little small I went up a size and it fits just right I am a medium and bought a large Totally worth it

This jacket is very lightweight it is comfortable it fits great and it keeps you warm I would highly recommend this jacket

Love these shoes A bit narrow but still great shoes

My experience with the shoes were great there comfortable

These are beautiful shoes i was so excited to get them Trying to put them on though was a painful experience Unless you have an extremely narrow foot do not bother with these they will break your heart

I ordered the Khaki Gum Light Brown Black leather version of these shoes As the title says I used KIWI C and Dry on them to make them more resistant to water But I think doing so cause the upper of the shoe to shrink after drying because they are super tight I can only wear them for about an hour before my toes start to go numb I also noticed that the heel cup of the shoe is to deep for my heel forcing the shoe to rub against my Achilles tendon which is very annoying All in all I think they will be a great shoe once I get them worn in Hopefully they stretch out soon because I really like the style and look of these shoes

After having this item for a while it ripped in the back one of the straps

These high tops are stark white and look great They run a little big These high tops are about one size smaller than Nike running shoes My son wears a size 13 running shoe but had to order these in a size 12

I got the Gore Tex version of this shoe in about 2007 and wore them out I wish the Gore Tex version was still available as I always wore them in inclement weather The 2016 version was painfully small in size 7 5 and I had to return

This shoe is perfect for everyday use I am going to use it for school

These shoes are comfortable and wear very well I also like to wear them with a pair of pants for a casual look

Its a cool shoe They are cool looking uhI do not know what you want me to say They fit and are comfortable enough I mean Ive barely had them two weeks and your already asking for a reviewYou have a pre set scale for durability how am I supposed to know that in such a short amount of timeI mean I guess they didnt combust or spontaneously tear themselves after using them a few times So thats pretty good then

Can never go wrong with a fresh pair of air forces

They are perfect They are durable look good feel good etc

Meet expectation

needed a good pair of comfortable shoes that I can easily slip on and these greatly exceeded my expectations I can walk in them all day and not get tired

You got to keep a pair of air force ones retro in the closest They are classic

Love this shirt Glad they still had Jeter stuff for sale

I brought these sneakers as a gift for someone but they loved them they said they are very comfortable an fits to size which is always great I love nike and would highly recommend their products to the people I come across

These sneakers are a great look for the perfect price

great jacket comfortable and warm fits good and is very good quality

Lightweight interior lining is comfortable and the sizing is perfect

This is the second time I purchase the same shoes for my son He likes them because they look great and are very comfortable I like them because they have the clean cut look

Its a good jacket but I got a medium and its too small I probably shouldve gotten a large

My husband says he wants more of this shirt in different color

This is our second unit My grandson just out grew the first

I would definitely recommend this jacket Super light weight and comfortable Perfect for early morning runs where its a little nippy outside and you want to stay warm but do not want to wear something too thick because it is uncomfortable to run in

Such a nice shirt great quality and durable I got it in 2 days from normal shipping 5 star shirt

I bought it for my Grandson He loves it and will not take it off

Janoskis are awesome shoes to wear with khakis or jeans I have the camo colorway which look fantastic but they are not very breathable After a year or so the midsole separated from the upper on the side of the instep but that is almost normal for skate shoes

The wind runner is suc high quality material Its very warm and comfortable and great for running when its windy raining cold ect Im going to purchase another in Black

This is the perfect windbreaker Looks fit are on point and the price tag cant be beat Highly recommend

Ive been a fan on the AF1 line my whole life and these are definitely one to add to the collection Being able to take the strap off completely with this style is a bonus as well

Really comfortable isnt too thick but still keeps you warm and it can be worn casually

fashion and comfort all in one I like the shoes wear to work on casual day somtimes

He loves them He has pins in his one ankle and the high top support protects his ankle from receiving any further injury Nike shoes are the only sneakers he will wear please keep making this model and color

this is a very good jacket comfortable and fits very well

Although Im not using the jacket for running purposes the windrummer is very stylish and cozy Its a little bigger than what I thought but I love it so much it doesnt matter

If your a fan then youll Luh theseShirts 100 cotton bonus for comfort Gotta rep for my home team all the time Ty for another great product Nike

Besides the nice style and the gum bottoms this is the worst shoe I have ever worn This hurts my feet ever single step I take

I purchased the Khaki Gum Light Brown Black color and it looks better in person The style is simple and this color would go good with any outfit Fits true to size Very comfortable after a long day These shoes are for casual use and not for skateboarding I would recommend spraying the protectant on this color since they are more susceptible to staining especially when liquids land on them

This jacket is amazing Love the color Love the fit of the jacket It fit perfect for a large Way to go Nike You keep coming out with stuff like this and keep my card ready I will shop here again

I do not skate anymore but these shoes are the best things I have ever worn I am a size 8 in womans and I bought the size 6 5 in mens My foot is also wide so I was kind of scared that it would not fit but they fit perfectly At first it was very snug and I could not move my foot around at all so I loosened the laces and it helped a lot so I would recommend loosening up the laces if they do not seem to fit I was so scared of getting blisters and dreading having to break into them but it only took me 2 days and no blisters I get a lot of compliments from these

I was unsure of what size to get when ordering this because I am between small medium This jacket does follow the size chart really well I am 5 10138 lbs and ordered a small The windrunner fits my ectomorph frame really well giving me a nice athletic looking taperthis jacket looks really amazing with any of the tech fleece joggers by the way The only reason I docked off of the durability is because the screenprint Nike swoosh seems like it will begin to scratch off after a couple washes I can not wait to wear it for a run and see how the waist holds Overall nice jacket that will definitely catch looks if you get it in any of the standout colors Any questions feel free to ask me

These shoes were a great fit and add good style to my collection of shoes they are very comfortable also the only thing is you have to be careful not to crease them all around good shoes though

good quality they match with many outfits good for winter or summer the delivery and service online was great no complaints about it I love Nike shoes I have around 8 pairs of this brand for running and casual shoes Ive bought shirts and tights and everything is made with good quality materials And because that I will buy more of this products in a future

do not use these shoes to skateboard with they will rip in 2 days of skating in the white sole is completely gone and I barely used them holes everywhere already

I got these shoes for my boyfriend for his birthday and we both love them they are super durable and can be worn with jeans or sweats and they still look good They can be dressed up or down Highly recommend

AF1 is always a dope sneaker this red one is a nice color and has good material

This jacket fits tighter and is wonderful for casual wear or running The athletic cut looks quite good I bought the Navy blue and purplish color and it looks phenomenal in person Overwhelmed by product Friend tried it on and would not take it off for the rest of the night

My teen high school daughter and her peers LOVE these shoes She get sooo many compliments on them and is asked how she keep them so white and nice looking all the time TENDER LOVE AND CARE

This is an amazing looking jacket and its very comfortable But just know that it is super thin and not meant to keep you very warm I bought one and liked it so much that I own three now Runs small so go bigger if your in between sizes

These shoes are BALLS in the comfort department but other then that they are nice

A solid piece for the price looks great and feels just as nice

Great build and durability that can be worn on the court or a night out chasing the ladies

The Air Force one high tops is an amazing shoe It fits nice and is extremely comfortable

how do you clean the ivory nike sb shoes can you just put them in the washer or is there a certain way

Nothing like a classic sneaker AF1 top quality since 1982

I got a size XS Im 53 1 2 and 135lbs The jacket fits perfect the XS anddoesnt really matter its basically the same size The XS is probably just a tad bit shorter than th

This AF 1 looks super cool And it wears comfortable enough I would recommend this pair of shoes

I had a pair of air force 1 low before and it was a really comfortable wear This time I try this high version and I got the same feeling as I was wearing the low expect for there is more heel support on the high It is stylish and good to wear at winter I will recommend to my friend about AF1

standarizing size Fit perfectly and comfortable The quality is great

I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas Unfortunately they were too narrow

Would pick this product anytime best product ever had best Nike ever created

this lifestyle shoe has a timeless design and fit

I enjoy this product and its fit I feel tht it pairs great with any outfit but still stands out and has a great look

I love my new and first pair of Nike JanoskiIt looks great on other clothing I tend to wear As well as matching a lot of clothing that I own

Excellent experience And visually attractive These are my first pair of Air Force Ones

Got these for my teenage son and he loves them Classic

These shoes are fantastic The styling is just what I was looking for and they hold up very well in tough winter conditions

Very good for the price There are very comfortable

Purchased for my 18 year old son as a Christmas gift He loves the casual style Fit was true to size and can be worn with a casual outfit as well as slightly dressed up with a pair of khakiand a dress shirt

These shoes always look good with jeans shorts whatever The heel tends to wear out on me a lot but put some moleskin on once it starts to wear then youre good

My son loves these Says they are super comfortable

The shirt was a gift for Christmas for someone else and they loved the material

I absolutely love my shoes They are a perfect fit they are very comfortable and true to size I have been looking for high top forces all over and could not find them Thank God for Nike com

These shoes are sometimes difficult to fine so I was very to happy to find them on the Nike website

poor quality for the price and poor representation of Derek Jeter

i recommend buying a pair overall great skate shoes and perfect for day to day activities and also for going out to a party bar

Bought these for my son He loves them He only wears Nike shoes

I love this shirt and so does my hubby It fits him perfect and the quality is top notch

Great product my boyfriend wears it all the time True to size and has lasted quite some time for him

only worn twice and have gotten 3 compliments on them already durable shoe that you need to break in but the Air Force 1s are iconic

I gave the shoes to my cousin as a birthday gift and he absolutely loved it He said that the fit was great and the color was what he expected it to be I got him the black pair with gum sole which was a nice change from the traditional white sole that can easily get dirty Great buy

Bought this shirt as a Christmas present my husband loved it it fit perfectly and the material was nice and soft loved it

Fits great feels excellent Would recommend to anyone as a great knock around shoe with looks

Great pair AF1 will always be timeless Great style

Very Nice Look Verthe Comfortable Very Stylish Should definitely Order A Pair

There isnt much more I can say that hasnt already been stated by countless others in regards to the Air Force 1 I bought these pair for my wife As you can tell this is a decidedly mens shoehowever I just got the size that I knew would fit her The shoe fit perfectly and was extremely comfortable This has now become her daily driver so to speak She was drawn to the color palette and the stitching that provides a more distinct look than more common AF1 releases Definitely a shoe to keep an eye on Would recommend

This shoe is very comfortable and very supportive in the ankles They match every outfit and has me looking good all the time

Given the opportunity to thank so lovely to have your shoes

These shoes fit just as expected Only bad thing is that when you take the straps off you will have a hella hard time putting them back on Other then that I love them They are comfortable and I am glad I bought them

I bought it for my boyfriend birthday he loved it so much it fits perfectly whatever you see on the picture is what you get

A perfect shoe to wear casually with jeans or shorts Simple look with a great feel to them

Shoe is light fitting and comfortable Lots of breathing room for my toes padding is even better

Shoes are very comfortable and it has the shape which moves as per my toes walking is so perfect with this shoes I would recommend this product

Exactly what I was expecting bought them for someone as a gift

Extremely comfortable and look great with everything

A size 6 was a perfect fit for me length wise but not width wise For the first week it was difficult to wear these shoes because they were so tight and I would lose feeling around the middle of my foot and toes The more you wear them the more they loosen up and become comfortable but you have to tough it out first

Very comfortable and size fits perfectly Shirt is soft and does not shrink when you wash

Is Stefan Janoski just a manIs he something moreI do not know What I do know is that when he set out to create a pair of shoes he ended up creating life changing foot vessels for all who would choose to wear them Everything positive that has ever happened to me in my entire life has happened in a pair of Janoskis When it comes to comfort wearing a pair of stefan foot fondlers is like having a baby foot angel embrace your arches while another whispers softly in your ear that she has never ever letting go Slipping into a fresh pair is like gently tucking your achy soles into the cashmere lined pouch of a loving mother Koala

ive had these shoes for 1 yearof everyday use now they are more comfortable than ever the wear adds character in my opinion and the suede is a breeze to clean

Excellent comfort great looking just a great overall shoe definetly should buy

I have been skateboarding for almost 10 years and out of all the shoes I have skated these Janoskis have been my favorite so far and I plan to skate them more in the future The shoes do take a couple of days of skating in them to actually get used to them on your board but after that you feel like you can feel every inch of your board under your feet This shoe gives you good flick scoop impact protection and overall just excellent performance in general I have a pair that I skate in now and I have been skating in them for about 2 months There has not been one rip in the suede at all and the sole has taken a lot more time to wear down than previous shoes I have used I would highly recommend this shoe for intermediate and expert skaters Excellent shoe

I love the details on the product from great texture nd smooth body also fit comfortable

They are pretty durable and they do not look bad but they are pretty narrow and I had to size up in order to wear them

Bought these for my son who is very picky about the design of his shoes He loves these

Great shoes I own about 5 different pairs Great casual everyday shoe as well as semi dressy occasions Definitely recommend

I have worn Air Force Ones since I was little and I love them crazy colors ways goes great with jeans Very durable shoe and super comfortable shoe would highly recommend the shoe

I love this shirt and what it stands for The sleeves feel slightly long and not tapered so its not perfect

Hey these shoes are fresh You put these babyon and you have comfort and fashion Really comfortable and I love the creamy color I got girls coming up hitting on me cause these shoes are hot Getcha some before they are gone

Very nice products and prompt service thanks

I have not worn them too much yet cause I can only really wear them on weekends They are comfortable and look really good but if you get white just be mentally prepared for them to get dirty

I brought this for my boyfriend and he has been enjoying it He loves the way it looks with all types of jeans and outfits especially nike tech It fits well and has been very durable for all weather conditions As well as the grip of the shoe Im thinking of even getting a pair of Air Forces for myself

This is a overall dope shoe Great craftmanship no glue marks comfortable and a clean look Besides great quality it is a Air Force 1 you can never go wrong with that

I got them as a 16th birthday gift from my 16 year old boyfriend He could not of done a better job I am in love with the shoe and I could not be happier Thanks baby

I recommend to people to purchase their own pair of shoes like those

Anything Derek Jeter is AWESOME Great player Great Product

I am a lover of all shoes This shoe was a must buy once I saw it I have been wearing Air Force ones for about 10 years I am very satisfied with this product

Amazing shoes comfortable and good quality AF1 is the best choice for you to choose

I purchased these shoes for my son he said they are the most comfortable pair of shoes ever and he only wears Nike but he absolutely loved these

This item is true to size very comfortable and the only thing is it gets creases very fast I am a Nike fan all the way Nike com had free and fast shipping thanks

I have a very typical 13 year old that it is all about the sneakers on the first day of school And these Airforce 1 did not disappoint He loves them they run small so we did order a size bigger But will definitely order again

These shoes are just perfect for me After years of shoes like this I finally hit the spot with these YES I recommend

This shirt fits well and is true to size I felt that it was very durable as well

This shoe looks and feels good once it is broken in and it is surprisingly durable

Overall the product I received was excellent Exactly what I wanted and were in perfect condition Very comfortable felt lightweight a very good footwear Would reccomend to anyone

These shoes are great I really like how they go with any outfit and also stand out so nice These shoes are really bright and stand out wherever you go The comfort is nice but these shoes are not true to size and a half size smaller would be nicer unless you prefer the extra room in the toe area All in all great shoes but do need a little extra caution These are a classic and make you feel proud almost

Great sneakers Love them I love the Nike SNKRS app and I plan to use it very often

Great quality shirt comfortable fit Used it out on a hot day at the ball park and stayed cool

The sneaker is very well made Comfortable and they look great The free shipping and fast delivery was awesome

I have been wanting to get a pair of forces for a while I was kind of holding off because I did not know if I could actually rock them with anything but boy was I wrong These are very comfortable The only downfall on this shoe is that it creases easily But that is expected from shoes I particularly do not like creases but we all have to live with them The shoe is definately a classic and it will not be my first pair

These are a nice color wave of a classic can not go wrong with airforce

They are very comfortable and look very clean

Tee is really comfy and quality is great I have bought 2 more in other colors and get compliments every time I wear it

They crease easily so be careful but they are very comfortable and in style

Love the splash of color These are comfy and recommend

It is a cool shoes with cool design The only downside is that this shoes look bigger than the other shoes with the same size

Bought this pair of sneakers a few weeks back As soon as I steeped in them = I didnt want to take them off my feet These sneakers are very comfortable

These shoes are comfortable to me and I would recommend them to anyone

I personally do not use the shoe for skating but as a casual shoe it is great Very comfortable shoe

Very nice shoes keep them clean and they look great with just about anything especially for the price of shoes today you can not beat it

I purchased this shirt for my son The shirt looks great feels great and washes great Mother approved

If your a die hard yankee fan and you respect greatest and for the love of baseball you will get this shirt And its just a great shirt to have in general

Good review shoes bend and have a creaase ti quick

I have been loyal to Nike for the better part of my 19 years and I have yet to find a shoe that is more iconic and recognizeable as the Air Force 1it is perfect with any style and looks good in realy any color way and just being honest it is quiet simply a comfortable shoe especially when you consider that you can ball out and walk home in the same pair It the best plain and simple

Clean and simple Got the Hornets colors Color pops Cotton is decent Would rather this be Dri Fit material instead

Overall these shoes are great My only complaint is that they run a little too slim in the mid area below the toes If you have a wider foot I recommend a half size up

Very comfy short good color choices and a nice fitting shirt came on tim

Shirt fits true to size very comfortable Always worried a white shirt will be see through but this one is not at all

Great color way for showing theCharlotte Hornetssome love

My experience was awesome I love using skateboarding shoes to wear anywhere because they are so FREAKING COMFORTABLE

one the best shoes ever made in my opinion not fpr exercise tho love the all black Best of the best Comfy and stylish

Super softshirt I love it RECOMMENDED You will not regret buying this shirt

I have always been a fan of the Jordan Brand for many years Nike Jordan Brand is made of the highest quality materials and items last for a long time

Just a little tight on top of the foot but once again a great shoe

You have to love the Air Force Ones I love the color scheme of these shoes They ran a little large but shoes are beautifully put together and fit great

After 4 days all the rubber is gone from kick flips already have holes all over they gave me blisters laces tore just a terrible shoe for skating

Bought these for my 14 year old He is an avid longboarder and just kills his shoes We have tried lots of brands of skate shoes but the Nikes last the longest

The Air Force One Low And the Air Force One High are my favorite all time shoes but the high is definitely my favorite of the two The way it is made now is outstanding I love the tumbled leather and the inside feels a lot better also My main feature of the high that makes it my favorite are the straps I always wear mine hanging off the back of the shoe I can not wait to utilize your NikeID to make me my own personal 1 of 1 of this model

I Wear this shoe as a shoe for school and Not only is the design sick but it is so incredibly comfortable to just walk around in So far I have not had any durability issues yet so that is also a plus

This is a part of my mas gift to my husband He loves Nike dri fit shirts He wears XXL and so I got him XXL and it is a perfect fit

It is my favorite skate shoe and I own and have tested over 100 pairs Thank you nike for putting this coveted color way on sale Best regards

I ordered this shoe for my son for Christmas It arrived when it was supposed to and he loved them They fit well and are durable Thanks

Love Jeter Jordan and red Done deal Shirt is very comfortable and fits perfectly

These shoes are great besides the color is a bit faded

Another great Jordanshirt with the added bonus ofRe2pectto Derek Jeter

I purchased this shoe for my daughter for the new school year She requested this shoe but in a different color We searched for the color she wanted at the local mall and they were sold out We went online to find the shoe she wanted and they were sold out as well So we searched through the website and this shoe caught her eye Was a little worried because we could not truly make out the actual shoe color but ordered it anyway When the shoes arrived my daughter called me and was elated It takes a lot to make her that happy

I bought these shoes because I needed a new pair They are comfortable When I put these shoes on I felt like I was on top of the world Great price great product Overall I really like them

Great Tee Congratulations To The Captain Derek Jeter

This has been the worst skate shoe i have ever skated It ripped in 2 days of skating I gave it 2 stars because of the looks wich are killer

These shoes are really durable and look great They are definitely worth the money you pay for them

it has very stylish looks and is very comfortable because it includes heel protection

The Janoskiare the best shoes I have skated I have been skating Janoskifor years and no other shoe compares Maximum board feel for flip tricks and comfortable enough for every day wear However one thing I would suggest is for Nike to make some slightly thicker insoles for impact protection

Great color combo and design all around good shoe But if you have slightly wider feet if you do not know if you do I highly suggest finding out if you do these shoes will be tight across the tops of your feet Mine just arrived an hour ago and going to wear them until hopefully they stretch out across the top I have loosened the laces as much as you can just before it looks obvious Kind of sucks if they do not stretch over the rest of this summer If you do not have wider feet they will fit like a glove and look ahhmazing

Got these bad boys and tried then out and they were awesome

Classic when one thinks of the word in regards to a sneaker one thinks Air Force 1 I had the all white color way for years as a kid and recently as well The quality is great and Nike NSW designers keep belting out nice new ones Need a restock on the brown with gum bottom color way please Also NikeID should allow new patterns materials and colors on the AF1 like on roshe run and allow users to mix colors

i like the sole of the shoes

This is an absolutely iconic skate shoe and a staple in the SB lineup I would highly recommend the product However I am really disappointed that they do not come with the rope or leather laces anymore Hopefully Nike will bring them back soon

These are great shoes I would recommend these to anyone

I needed some gray kicks with a little flash the gray venom Janoski fit the bill They feel slightly narrow but I have slightly wide feet If you measure slightly wider than would you should be fine The insoles are really comfy but they do come out easily if you need to put in your own Would recommend

Pretty true to size although they are cut narrow Overall a good shoe I just need something to kick around in

This is the best Nike shoe I have ever bought It looks amazing and fits great I absolutely love it and I where these any chance I get

This shoe looks 100x better in person and the feel is great

I recently just ordered a pair of these in paisely and i have three others they are a nice shoe worth the price i would recomend it for any one looking for a new skate shoe or just casual wear

I used to have a favorite pair of shoes I would always buy It was time to move onto something better I love you

Nice shoe Bought these shoes for my bf and he loves them

Bought these for my boys as a gift and I was very impressed with the product I should mention that the boys were beyond excited as well Overall a great board shoe

Good shoe great style would not recommend for running

This shoe is very comfortable and I highly recommend well worth the price

The shoes are excellent from the quality of the shoes down to the comfort and style of them this shoe is very easy to break in and also is very durable making them last for a long time Overall great shoe

Stefanshoe is certainly cool but it is also very comfortable The shoes are stiff at first but they break in very well I would recommend these shoes to anyone but especially people who would wear them for skating

great material and performance it is the perfect shoe for everyday living

This shoe is all around an amazing shoe i use it pretty much for everything skating and casual

Everything is great from the material standpoint and to performance itself

Very comfortable casual and stylish it is the perfect shoe for everyday living

I use these shoes primarily for partying and I can not say anything i dislike about them because they are comfortable stylish and still allow you to move around quickly If you need a good casual shoe for parties or just for general non sport usage these are for you

I was looking for good shoes for skating this one looks good for skating Unfortunately its too narrow so that i am very uncomfortable

Absolutely love the shoes could not ask for a better pair Good colors very comfortable Go with just about any outfit Love wearing them

For those who are complaining about it being hard to get the shoes on it is called loosening the laces Overall very very stylish and I get compliments everytime I wear it I would suggest only wearing it minimally to keep it clean If you are a sneaker head of course

I got the all black AF1and I was not disappointed when i received them by mail

Comfortable fitting and sharp

Perfect summer time shoes Casual and looks good on pants or shorts Highly recommend to purchase

Love the shoes A little stiff at first but only takes a cpl times wearing them to get them loosened up As far as the color goes they are def pink Comes with a cotton pair of neon pink laces as well as red tubes Great shoe

I thought that being a high top shoe this would not feel comfortable along the ankle area but I was surprised that it does not feel as constricted as I thought it would have been Another classic shoe to rock especially with shorts

Bought it as a giftit is true to size and goes with everything

This is my second pair of these shoes and I still love them great style and great shoe

great overall shoe going to get me another pair soon

These shoes look great and feel great have several pairs

Stylish Comfortable unique Textures and color Scheme Another Valued Sneaker for my Collection

I bought these shoes for back to school and they are great

First janoski I bought were basic black and I hated them at the start because of the tight fit but then after 1 hour of skating thay just got perfect for my feet and the same shoes I have had for 1 year and skated in them a lot I now have 7 pairs of janoski The only difference is that if you want the best skateshoes with alot of board feel buy the suede with leather laces but do not use canvas or leather janoski shoes for skating they are not made for skating just look good I use the limited Janoski floral for daily use and 3 different suede janoskis for skating

I ride BMX in these and the grip is unreal I will always wear these over anything go cop a pair right now

More comfortable than I expected Will be buying another pair

I love the janoskialways have The look awesome and have great colors I had just bought the purple pair and they look so much better out of the box than the pictures

They are so comfortable and i was very well pleased when i put them on today

THIS IS A GREAT SHOE FOR ALL TYPES OF TERRAIN GREAT DESIGN AND COMFORT ALTHOUGH I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL BRING BACK SOME OLD COLROS SUCH AS RED OXIDE WHICH IS A VERY POPULAR COLOR

I have multiple pairs of shoes and these were added to my collection not to long ago I have been nothing but satisfied with my purchase They are one of my favorites

look great last long feel great i would reccomend to anyone

This is an awesome shoe really comfortable and durable The green ones are not really the same color as in the picture but they are still really nice

shoes were uncomfortable and not very good to skate in not worth buying these shoes buy some kostons instead last longer really comfortable and great for skating i recommend eric koston shoes

I am a big fan of the classic Air Force 1 line This shoe continues the fine tradition

i use mine for walking and they are pretty good just for walking i do not know about skateboarding pretty good shoe overall

Great pair of kicks my fourth pair already they are comfortable and durable i love the sockliner and how they through in some heel support to reduce imapct and the chance of getting heal bruise love these kicks highly recommended

True to sizelooks a lot more tailored than a traditional skateboard shoenot wide at all I wear as a work shoe every day khakis and a polo shirt Blue with a gold swoosh looks great Very comfortable Been buying Nike SB for years now and mever been disappointed

These are some great shoes the go with pretty much everything i wear there pretty comforterable a little narrow but its nothing thats unbearable

I got the black and gold leather colorway and they skate great ive been skating them for like 3 months now and i hardly have a rip in them and the grip on the bottom is still not worn down The air in soul thing in the heel is amazing when you land a heelflip in primo i would seriously suggest these shoes to any one who skateboards

awesome feel I wear them for everyday use both mid and lows Easily one of the best silhouettes nikes ever created great skate shoes light and very durable

my favorite sb of all time super comfortable and could be worn with anything pick up a pair now

This is probably the best skate shoe ive ever worn It is comfortable durable and looks dope from every angle These last fairly long when skating and are really comfortable for every situation I love these and recommend these to anyone

Most impressive shoe Top notchI like a sneaker that gives great ankle support Awesome colorlooks like a million bucks They are tough to get on but once secured I barely know they are there Perhaps tube laces as opposed to flat ones Maybe later models might include a zipper for easier entry Still the sharpest looking shoe in the Nike Locker Love the obsidian color

I bought these shoes a week ago and notcied first off they are very heavy and hard to put on you have to un lace everytime just to take off and put back on Otherwise the color is great but if your wearing low cut socks the tag on the tounge of the shoe will annoy your front ankle Otherwise very stylish also very comfortable

I am not a skateboarder I just wanted to wear these to walk around in I bought these and wore them for two days and the stitching near the toe box already began to tear I would think that a skateboard shoe would be more durable

these are the freshest shoes I have ever owned and i always get compliments on them I love them Now I am gonna buy another pair and i would have bought them on here but they do not have the colorway that i want available I just wished that Nike had the rest of the colorways available that would be great

I saw them and thought they were beautiful but wen i got them they are very hard to get into and they are very bulky and heavy i reccomend then air force 1 lows they are less bulky easy to get into and still look awesome

The airforce series has to be possibly the best series of shoes ever made This shoe is my favorite out of the series due to the fact that they are comfortable stylish easy to wear with anything and overall a durable shoe

These shoes are delightful and allow me to fully grace my panini getting pursuit

great shoe for going out and waking or excercising

So there good for just walking cause i just walk around a two story bulding So someone tell me different

these air force is the best i ever bought verry comfortable

I use these as just walk around shoes and they are great They do run kind of small so if you want a lot of room get the next size bigger And if you do not once you break them in you will be okay

This shoe is great and stylish It is comfortable once you break it in and my only problem i have with it is that it creases almost immeditatly

air force 1 hiis my shoe of choice i ride a motorcycle every day and just love how durable they are this color rocks i call them panda bears

Went into a Niketown looking for my first pair of AF1Saw these and immediately knew I was about to make a perfect choice They were a little stiff at first but once I broke them in they have been amazing I can not wait to wear them more and to continue to find more pairs

My first pair of AF 1 and a very satisfied customer The shoe size fits perfectly and definitely looking to purchase more in the future

Great shoe great price and fast service Super satisfied and have already referred friends and family

The shoe did not feel very soft It felt pretty hard all over I could feel the back of the shoe digging into my Achilles That hurt The shoe is not that soft I would say it pretty resistant I bought this for 50 so I am not complaining too much

Love this shoe But I have one issue why do not they make this style in size 12 512 is slightly too small and 13 make me look like a clown I am 5 Very disappointed but hopefully the next version of this style will have the 12 5

I ordered these shoes about 3 months ago expecting the main color to be brown but was disappointed the they were mainly green Because of that I rarely wear them and when i do it is to go to my work office After mild use one of the shoes ripped now randomly on the sides I have several nike shoes for all purposes nothing like this has ever happened

I have had these shoes over a month and nothing I have tried can make them quiet A little noise hear and there would be fine but these things are loud with every step Not happy with this considering how much I paid

Got the all white sneaks knowing they had be hard to clean but I did not expect that to be from my own blood The tab on the back of these shoes digs into my heel Within a day I was bleeding all over these sneakers The only way I can wear them is with band aids on the back of my ankles

You would think the whole shoe throughout would be a PURE white like the midsole of the shoe and how the pictures show But once you see these in person you will be sorely disappointed The white on the flyknit it NOT a pure white It is barely even a white it is more of an easter green silver MAYBE in the dark you might not notice but these are a bright summer shoe made to be worn in the daylight I LOVED how this shoe looked in Nikepictures and could not wait to get my hands on them and now I am contemplating whether I should even keep them or not

Would definitely recommend the Flyknit trainers as they are super comfortable and the knit is really beautiful up close I purchased the Oreo pair and love the look and contrast of the black and white

Love the look of the shoe Not that comfortable and the flyknit isnt super soft

Great seeming shoe Lightweight good for summer since it is relatively breathable and all that but the heel feels like it is about 1 2 an inch tall because it slips off my heel a ton and practically slips so far that it falls underneath my heel I laced them up super tight to try to fix it but 1 it did not work and 2 I would not want to wear my shoes like that anyways

The Color On This Shoe Is Not That Bright it is More Of A Dark Mustard I Was Very Dissapointed Because i Actually Love This Shoe All Around Great Comfortable Show But The Color Is Not Right and Described Correctly or Displayed Correctly

Very comfortable shoe fits great looks great Not too narrow Tried the flyknit racer but that shoe felt more narrow this one feels better around the toes

Most comfortable UA shoe I have ever owned and I have been buying 3 4 pair of UA shoes per year since about 2013 These slip right on like slippers and feel like walking on 2 foam I can wear them to the gym or just for all day leisure PS I love the print too

Due to foot issues from sports wear and tear I need shoes that keep my feet comfortable both for short and long periods of time Most brands do not meet that need however UA sport shoes do Support and comfort are provided by the HOVR SLK EVOI can wear walking all day long without discomfort A great find

Very good shoe will buy another pair later on to double up or customize

all of his shos that he made combined in 1 outstanding miraculous shoe cant wait to play in them

I did not like the over all look of the shoes Too big of a sole Fit was fine The biggest problem I had was the cut out in the sole They would tug on my socks I can feel the cut outs Does not work for me at all

The shoe itself is great But I paid full price for the shoes and get them and it has a sale sticker on them for forty dollars off and the box looked like it had gone through a paper shredder Not happy about either of those things I will not buy online anymore that is for sure

From a pure comfort perspective UltraBOOST is softer and more comfortable These are a bit wider than the UltraBOOST less expensive and more available though So pick your poison Still a very comfortable shoe for casual running around the office hopping on the Elliptical etc I am not a runner but these would be better suited for that than the Ultra 

Best pair of shoes I have ever owned no wonder these shoes are popular

Love the shoes Second pair of pureboosts that I have bought Only thing I was honestly disappointed in is that the details and descriptions on here state that the shoes are primeknit These are not primeknit The shoes still have the same upper as all the other ones so that was definitely a let down

Excellent alternative for those who keep waiting on the ultra boost triple black Very comfortable I use these shoes for weight training crossfit but the design is good and they can be used as a casual shoe

These shoes are auper comfortable and stylish Unfortunately when compared to the Busenitz Boost the boost a bot firmer That being said these shoes are incredible and I would suggest these to anyone that can find them

These shoes are straight fire very stylish very comfortable could wear all day long anywhere Good performance for running which they are made for not so great for traction if you are going to play basketball in them Still worth a 5 5 because they are not basketball shoes Love them might even buy more

I bought these shoes to run and do circuit training and they did not disappoint

This shoes are perfect for people like me that have wide feet they fit true to size for example ultra boost shoes I have to get them 1 2 a size up for the to fit comfortable but this is my second pair of Pureboost and they are my favorite out of the two because of the colors and also because they are reflective at night pretty cool when you are walking at night

amazing shoe if you love pure boost but for some reason runs an entire size too big I generally wear a size 9 in pure boost perfect fit and had to size be warned Really strange the same model pure boost would run so big it is ok adidas com will exchange for you

I have wider feet than most people so these shoes were perfect for me

They are not my favorite Adidas shoe but they are rock solid Comfortable for any occasion

If you came here looking for a comfortable shoe that is not too expensive Pureboosts are the way to go It features a harder boost feeling than Ultraboost but still offers a quite comfortable ride Go True to size toe box is a little wider than normal Knit is a little tough and features a burrito tongue that can be annoying Overall however the Pureboost provides a great comfortable casual experience

Adidas make is the best sneakers Bought theses and and many more to come

The shoe has a nice knit upper that really breaks forms to your foot giving it the perfect fit The comfort is very nice but the boost is a bit on the firmer side I get lots of complements of this shoe

The color was off on the boost it is metallic where as in the photos it looks like it is off white

Great everyday shoe Very comfortable Would buy again

The comfort and support this shoe offers is amazing I had wanted them for awhile and after I bought them I can not imagine not having them The burrito tongue is odd to get used to and the seam from the tongue rubs on my big toe a little but I have adjusted The rubber cushions on the heel offer so much heel support and lockdown it is crazy 10 10

The shoes are very comfortable but after a couple miles I develop blisters underneath the knuckles of my big toes there is no insole and maybe that is the issue The outsole is comprised of rows of raised knobs and one of them impacts in that exact location They look great and I would definitely recommend wearing them casually

I have another pair of them that I purchased last year and they have been great Very comfortable and light weight I do not run but I am a bigtime walker and these shoes are the best can not beat Adidas I have several pairs of golf shoes as well

do not usually recommend shoes but this one is the exception The knitting is amazing Makes it few light and is very flexible as well The soles are a strange lattice or support however it supports it does it well

Comfort This is my third pair They are my go to shoe

I like how the tongue of the shoe is overlapped allowing more space for freedom last yearpure boosts did not have this feature they are more like ultra boosts in their design I like the originality of these pure boosts

Perfect fit very light shoe The boost makes the shoe great for walking and getting around I have not used it for the gym yet but plan to this week The burrito lip does not bother me too much

Comfortable the tongue or flap too cumbersome should be a litttle cleaner

Very sharp looking comfort and style all in one My husband received multiple compliments

Comfortable shoe Love the comfort I am not actually a runner just my day to day shoes

Perfect but my only problem was the double stitching kind of made the shoe a bit awkward but other than that great job adidas

Ordered my second pair Returned them only because the right shoe felt significantly larger than the left My first paircurrently ownfit like a glove

I liked it because i own a pair before shdddhdhjdjdjdd

Love this shoe great looking and extremely comfortable

3 too bouncy and spongy for serious running comfortable for the first 10 mins but then draining from that point onwards

Very comfy for both leisure and active wear Colors are perfect very stylish I have received a lot of compliments at work at the gym and around town Low medium arch support the wide base make these ideal for my trips to the gym or even trail running while being nice and dark enough to wear out for date night or semi casual dinner Best purchase I have made

its really comfortable I will recommend this shoe to any runner

Great quality and they are comfortable Free shipping was nice as well

it is the most comfortable shoes I have ever had in my entire life

The shoe seems awesome in terms if comfort and style Unfortunately I did not get to wear it even once since one of the eyelets broke off from the right shoe when I was loosening the laces to get it on Could have been good but quality not up to par

9 10 No insole feels a bit weird on bottom of foot Upper knot material very comfortable

10 miles of walking NYC and nothing to say but comfy

The comfort and style can not be beat Pure boost is the best

These are great heat fye great amazing delicious shoes

I like the style and comfort I also appreciate the ease of ordering

Very light and comfortable shoes After 6 8 hours per day standing my legs feel great I am 6 4 350 pounds with very high arch The inner part its amazing Great support

Good looking very comfortable shoes Highly recommend

Gives great comfort while also looking fresh on foot

These shoes did not fit very well and I probably could have sized down a half size which may have alleviated most of my issues I liked the black boost sole and black and white print I really did not like the fold over or burrito style tongue as some have called it The material was more stiff than expected Since I had purchased other shoes that fit well I decided to return these instead of exchange for a different size

These shoes are so comfortable and easy to wear during workout

I have two pairs navy blue and core blk Had to settle for blk Got tried of waiting for triple black to come in stores in San Francisco

Normally an 11 got a 10 and it fits perfect Boost is life

Great overall shoe Comfortable fit for casual look

Comfortable fits a little wide Made with very nice materials

I bought these for my boyfriend as a graduation gift He can not stop raving about them They also look very neat on foot and he says they are very comfortable

Looks great but sizing was off for me I am typically a 9 5 US in Adidas but found my toes to be crunched up against the front Would otherwise be comfortable but unfortunately not sure I can wear them with the sizing off Results in a waste of money

Better than the ultra boost in my opinion probably because I have a wide foot Great shoe for anyone but even better for us wide footers

Have wide feet and there is a hole on the side already

Shoes fit perfect very comfortable great for running

Comfortable shoe fits a lil wide which is nice since I have wider feet

These are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

great feel boost is not as fluffy as other boost shoes but provides a sturdier stage for running I use them for every day wear but could definitely see them replacing my current pair of running shoes as I break them in Very flashy I have gotten many compliments in them Only complaint is that they get called fake yeezys which is also a plus if you like that style of shoe

This shoe is awesome it is fits great and is extremely comfortable and accommodates my wide feet perfectly I have 2 pairs of the pureboosts

Exactly what I wanted Extremely comfortable Perfect

Great shoe beautifully designed and one of most comfortable shoes I own

I just got these and was hoping they would have a similar comfort level to the Ultraboost which I love and have owned three pairs The pattern on the insole is the exact same pattern as the bottom of the squares yet the pattern is raised ever so slightly so the comfort is compromised and the footbed is nowhere near as plush and cushy as the Ultraboost

Great support while still feeling like you are walking on a cloud

Bounce technology is very comfortable boost is awsome bring the triple black

Boost cushioning is by far the best Just missing insoles Why no insolesTired of buying insoles for an expensive shoe

Incredibly comfortable I do think they could be a little more durable but still worth every penny and I plan on buying another pair

i work in retail and im on my feet for the majority of my shift I feel like I am walking on clouds all day long

do not widen the sole to much If you can make it with the pure boost DPR sole and pure boost burrito knit it would be nice

Comfortable and looks great Priced awesome too

Like the way they look very comfortable with good support

Great comfortable fit It is an amazing looking shoe My only issue with this shoe is that the bottom gets dirty easily and that is after I used a water and stain repellent spray on it I would suggest getting one with a dark bottom if that is an issue for you Besides that I feel satisfied with the purchase

Great shoe boost is excellent cushioning system do not hesitate to buy these

I love the look of this shoe good casual addition to my wardrobe

Excellent comfort level Ultra boost quality and comfort never disappoints Would love to see better availability in the triple black color

Liked it Everyday shoe Boost is black so no worries for raining days

My shin does not hurt after a run and the calves feel great as well

Great quality with comfort but a little wide I love it

Honestly the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I wish I could wear them to work

The shoe looks cool and is comfortable It doesnt provide much support which makes my feet hurt after awhile Overall recommend

The product is very good quality as many things from Adidas are The shoe fits properly and pretty snug If I had the money I would have a second pair for everyday use

The design speaks for itself Coolness comfort durability all in one This is a stylish workout shoes but I love them so much that I wear them on casual Fridays too I have plantar fasciitis before I got these and so far it is holding up great

I like it since its really comfortable for running

very fashionable and fits extremely well on your feet

The boost in this shoe gives great cushion and comfort The toe box is wide and great for people with flat wide feet like me Great shoe for esthetics and well as performance

Just perfect The boost technology is perfect and very responsive

got shoes with a huge hole in one of them no quality control whatsoever

Great product very comfortable and responsive Love the grey soles Would give 5 stars but had to take one away because when I received them the stitching was already coming undone on the left shoe so I had to sew it up myself

Very very very very very comfortable pair its worth it

No inserts needed for foot comfortability My feet move around easily in them

I am on my feet all day

Soooo comfortable that i never get foot aches no more

So I originally purchased with fingers crossed and based on the many solid reviews I have to say the comfort quality and looks of the shoe is phenomenal I plan on purchasing a pair for my wife since she likes long walks and wanted something stylish as well

Have many Boost shoes and these do not disappoint Very comfortable and love the gray colored boost soles

Perfect fit would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice shoe

Went half a size smaller on accident and fits perfectly

I run like 40K per week and this is the most comfortable shoe ever

It fits great and looks even better I love this shoe

Very comfortable and matches with everything i wear

The most comfortable best looking shoes I bought fits like a glove would recommend it to anyone just too good of a shoe

Second pair of the new Pure Boosts I have purchased I have the maroon ones as well and these are just as good Same great quality and comfort The tongue still and bumps on the bottom of the shoes still take some getting used to but I am happy that they packaged a second set of flat laces to replace the thick ones in the picture The flat laces are much better so I recommend switching them out

Comfy and designs of the said product Prices are just enough

One of the most comfortable shoes ever Excellent for running

Extremely comfortable specially like how breathable the material is

The shoes came fast and were super clean no issues

Pure boost and Ultra boost are super comfortable shoes

Superior quality stylish great color combination and use of different materials

Overall very nice and comfortable shoes Seem well built but will not work for anything other than every day wear

it is comfortable and cheap for its price I wish their were no pods on the side

the fabric upper keeps my feet cool when it is hot

I like the shoe but returned because it ran big It is one of the softest shoes I have felt but would definitely like to see it with a gum sole Runs a 1 2 size big Now looking for a sik ultra boost with a gum sole

Best pair of shoes I have had in a very long time

One word BOOST Love the colors love the design Very stylish and comfortable what more can you ask

The comfort and look of this shoe is rather impressive If you are new to the Boost shoes or a big fan you will love this shoe

comfy and light insole could be better nice color

Great style and fit Really nice color and quality

On my feet all day and absolutely love this shoe Will definitely be buying addidas products from now on

Comfortable and good support I would definitely recommend

I love the Pure Boost These shoes are super comfortable for all day wear They may just be my next running shoe

Son loves it Kids at school thinks its cool

I bought this product a week ago and have only had it for a day now and I have to say this is my second pair of adidas boost the comfort in the heel is insanity and I expected less for it being painted The boost has some sort of a glossy finish over it and the burrito style tongue raps around the top of your foot and feels like a sock there is no insole in these shoes and some people complained about that but in my opinion it is still as comfortable as any shoe with an insole I love how adidas can show that there boost is comfortable without any sort of insole it is awesome Overall after having this shoe for a DAY I can happily say go a half size up it is a very comfortable shoe and recommend it to everyone no matter the use

If you are not into the uncaged or want to use a running shoe this is a great alternative it is sole makes for a great comfortable firm step and it is material looks great with anything you wear

Game changer Shoe has it all One of the dopest shoes I own

I like the pureboost mainly for the comfort even though it is not the Ultraboost it is still similar to the comfort

Really great walking shoes instead of running This is shoes is really comfortable in terms of walking But I find it does not provide enough support for running

Shoe was uncomfortable Not my kind of shoe Ultra boost all the way

very comfortable with the width giving you alttle more space

Very comfortable shoehowever after only a month of casual wear and light running outsole is starting to show signs of separation from the boost Great for casual wear not so much for running Average score due to it is durability

Very comfortable in heal Toebox needs to be wider You know most shoes tear by your pinky toe do to not being wide enough and forcing it to stretch too much This shoe has that same issue

The shoe is great it is very comfortable and looks nice Two things I would have like to know are the inside is purple and the tongue is not like a normal tongue it is two pieces of fabric Otherwise it is a great shoe if you are okay with that

Just got these in the mail today and I have to say one of the most comfortable and great looking shoes comparable to the ultra boosts I usually wear 9 5 menUB and I have wide feet so I went down 5 size for the Pure Boosts and they are perfect No awkward toe or foot looking bulges because the PB designed a wider toe box for running as it is made for and it fits like a glove I am actually starting to prefer the Pures now because it is slightly just slightly like 15 less boost vs Ultras less cushioning than the Ultras so it helps for standing at work for 6 8 hours Exercise wise I wore them to my Filipino martial arts class where a lot of footwork is involved and the Pures delivered Dope shoe I recommend these 100

I love the color combo and the overall design 5 stars

These shoes are amazing They feel like you are walking on pillows and Everytime I take a step I feel like falling asleep

Fits like a glove Great cushion for any type of activity

LOVE THESE SHOES I have had adidas but this is my first boost I love them so comfortable will be buying more in the future that is for sure

Been wanting a pair for the longest Very comfortable Went down a full size and I am a big dude so I would recommend

it is comfortable and would recommend to anyone who likes shoes

These are the best looking Pureboosts that have been released I like the sock like fit and they are more supportive than the first ones I bought a couple of years ago Now if they only put these on miadidas along with the ultraboost

was not sure about how I felt about the color wave compared to others before I bought them However as soon as I put them on my feet I knew these were the ones

I have been looking for the perfect pair of Boost shoes for a couple months I was excited when I finally tried on the PureBoost and instantly fell in love It help that they look amazing aswell

The Ultraboost and NMD have brought me back to the 3 Stripes having said that this shoe is my favorite of those 3 It looks amazing and feels the best of the 3 Keep dope colorways coming and I will keep buying

So I have had several pairs of the Air Jordan sandals They all have been very well made and looked above and beyond better than your average looking sandals Well once again they did not fail I get compliments on the Sandals all the time they are so comfortable They do run a little big and wide but overall these sandals do not disappoint With the 23 on the top of Sandals and the color blue these sandals are sick

Shoes fit well are comfortable My husband complain has to do with the Velcro scrap It does not hold well and his sandals open up from time to time while walking causing him to trip or walk off with out the shoe Check the making of the shows although it is Jordan brand it is made in China For the price sandals are not very good

The Grail of Slides The GOAT They are beautiful and comfortable it is Jordan nuff said

Good pair but takes time to work it in before the material becomes confortable

Comfortable shoes neutral color pair shose you that can be wear all day

It felt comfy on my feet i bought 2 one for playing basketball and the other for casual wear My wife liked it as well and I ended up buying her a pair as well

If you had a criticism of any type of the LBJ 15 you need to get these on court ASAP Nike has really made a more versatile shoe in the LBJ 16 Traction is improved similar to the Soldier 12 cushion is great just lower and more responsive battle knit 2 0 feels real nice You might need to make some adjustment to the laces for better lock down though Combine all that with the fact that these you can actually get away with off court can not say enough about these Staying in the rotation

Played in them twice so far and I love them they are an excellent shoe for flat wide feet they are durable and a great looking style I could wear these shoes all day with the great ride it supports for my feet Optional for a tighter fit with other holes for the laces Unlike most Nike Basketball shoes this she is not narrow at all My feet feel great after playing

These are my first Lebron shoe Went with the Oreo colorway When first trying them on I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable they are Many basketball shoes are too narrow for me but these are made for someone with a little wider feet They also seem durable in the sense they do not get dirty too easily I live in WI and being in winter there is snow and salt everywhere and I have worn them outside multiple times already and they do not seem to attract dirt and salt too much which is awesome Please come out with some new colorways soon Would definitely buy another pair

The best Lebron I have ever had looks heavy but it is not Strong and flexible bottom Very nice details Amazing black and gold combination Fits the Kings only

Overall a very comfortable shoe except like a previous reviewer noted the tongue digs into your ankle a little As far as looks go have been complimented multiple times when worn casually Would have given 5 stars but the tongue is a bit rigid Hopefully will wear in soon and not be an issue

I am comparing them to the 15which were one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn These are much lower barely a mid they feel heavier the toe box seems narrower and you still have dead space at the toe when going true to size The cushion is not even close to the 15 this shoe is much stiffer so rolling your ankle is less likely The 15 was a little tippy this one is not But to me it feels like a narrow brick

The 15were perfect for me so I am going to compare the 16to them The addition of the tongue rather than the full knit sock is a downgrade The tongue digs into the ankle a bit The footbed is still very comfortable and durable and wide enough for my feet Most air max footbeds are too narrow for me and I get sad about it Flyknit tech is also wonderful

Love this show except for when you make lateral movements it creates a substantial rub on the inside of your ankle I wore the shoe two separate times never get blisters from new shoes and both times started bleeding from the discomfort the shoe caused I loved the grip the foundation of the shoe the toe and just about everything else about the shoe so I am disappointed I have to exchange replace them For context I have warn lebron shoes since his 2011 playoff shoes and have loved every pair really disappointed his time around

Very comfortable great fit especially for wide feet good ankle support and stability Highly recommended

Must have for your collection Soild Even sweeter in person and on feet

The shoe is beautiful But I made the mistake of only having Lebron 15s so when I bought these I was expecting that same snug fit but in these amazing colors that match my car lol Also My car is a stick shift and for some reason the left heel scratches against the shoe causing a bruise I had to wear more cushion on that foot because my ankle socks are too low and cause problems

Overall this shoe is nice Looks good feels great and lower to the ground I have not balled in these yet I wear them to work I walk alot Waiting to use them indoor on the hardwood Also this battle net feels even stronger Still like a sock but a more of a shoe now You have to add this to your collection

They are very comfortable durable and fit just right They so far are my favorite LeBrons that i have worn and i have every single pair of LeBrons

Lock down tough to get that ideal lock down without an outside source IE brace tape etc Similar to the LBJ 16 they do not do a good enough job pulling your heel in similar to what a Kobe would

Wish you had more of other colors in my size I love my color but wanted in black

Comfort Performance Stylish are amongst the strongest points with these flyknit vapor maxWorth every penny They were tight the 1st few days but they stretched out with wear and use

Set my PR purchase for most expensive pair of athletic shoes They have been totally worth it The look feel and performance is awesome I continuously get ask What are Those They do squeak a bit when you walk but the feel on the treadmill or during training is incredible

I really wanted to like these shoes when I got them I really liked the flyknit and color scheme Also not having to tie my shoes was a plus The vapormax cushioning was so comfortable I do wish I listened to what others were saying about the heal rubbing against them It rubbed so bad on me that it started to blister It was to the point of them being unwearable so I had to return them

The vapormax shoes do not distribute weight on the foot in a manner that is ergonomic and likely damaging to a runners fifth metatarsal outside of foot Further the ankle grip is too rubs against your achilles tendon causing blisters despite wearing long socks

Just got these today and I am so happy that I did they are by far the most comfortable shoe ive ever worn and they look great too I read some of the other reviews and was kind of worried that the opening would not be big enough to get my foot in to but for me I had no such problem they went on really easy there also incredibly light which is also a plus I highly recommend these They are true to size

The utility is by far the lightest and most comfortable shoe I own They start off loud but that goes away after a while They are still squeaky after being on a wet surface though While I love how these are designed they are limited to drier conditions I can not wear these when it snows Me not being able to wear this shoe all year is the only reason it does not get 5 stars

These shoes are really comfortable and I really like the way the look However I am very disappointed in the build quality The loop on the top of the shoe has snagged loose thread it is really a shame Good shoe though

The look and design of these shoes are very unique in a good way Getting them on at first seems to be little different than usual but once on they feel great The laces are awesome No tying of these shoes Strap on tighten up and you are off The air soles feel great in the gym Feels like I am walking on air

I bought these and loved them The only downside was that the back of my ankle kept getting blisters and irritated to being to tight I was hoping to get another pair in the future

I bought these not expecting much for actually running As a HYPEBEAT I thought they were pretty dope but these shoes were so comfortable it made me want to run

This shoe is super dope BUT they are hard to slip on and the stitching is so thick around the ankle it bruised my leg from the friction the bottom squeaks when walking but I LOVE THESE SHOES

Laces need to to the bed of the shoe the fliKit stretches crazy Looks amazing I loved the shoe but it just flat was not made to do anything else but to break a ankle Foot rolls right off the sole and The loops broke to

I really love the way this shoe looks and its very comfortable soles but the plastic on rear heels rubbed my skin off so I hate to say it but dope shoe besides that heel issue I Hope this issue is corrected

Most amazing shoes I ever bought worth the price

Best shoe in my collection and the reason I say that is because they do not crease because there is no leather also they are very easy to clean These shoes are the lightest shoes I have ever had These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I usually wear Jordans usually do not buy running shoes but when I did I wish I would have had these comes with a nice bag The best thing that I like about these is that you can wear them and after having mine for almost 2 months they look like they did when I pulled them out of the box

Takes a while to put on but shoe is comfortable Broke loop on left side when putting on so needs to be stitched down better Comfortable to wear Easy to take off

Shoes look and feel great My only complaint would be that with the them being almost completely plastic on the outside dirt gets inside the tiny squares and makes it hard to clean Overall good pair of shoes tho Very comfortable

These are extremely tight in the ankle And you can see through the mesh part on the shoe So if you wear any other color sock besides black it will show through Because of the ankle tightness I am returning the shoe Btw I have small ankles

I really like the look and feel of these shoes I had to take one star off because the opening is a little too snug I have only worn them a few times so hopefully they will loosen up a little They are extremely light and fit my feet like gloves

I found this shoe to be more comfortable than the regular Vapor Max the foam helps greatly I also like the flynit much better than the standard model However I felt that the heel counter is too high and rubbed the back of my ankles with every step causing severe irritation This was after a 2 mile walk I probably would not have noticed had I not gone on a prolonged walk Unfortunately I will have to return them it is too bad as otherwise I like them I will try another model in the future if they fix the heal issue

Overall a good solid shoe but its not worth paying the extra money for these over the Nike Air VaporMax Flyknit 2 So thats why I gave it a 4 star

I want to preface by saying that I am a very big fan of the vapormax silhouette The utility model really caught my attention and I was ecstatic to put these straight onto my feet However after one or two wears I began to notice discomfort around my heel it is escalated to the point my heel turned bright red almost to the point of bleeding and I had to just take off the sneakers for the remainder of my day

These shoes are a really big upgrade from a Airmax OMG they are so comfortable and fit almost like a glove with just the right amount of space for your feet to move around and breathe I still gave it 5 stars but the only issue i had was the back kinda digging into my achilles but i think it will go away the more i wear them it is only on the right shoe Beside that i love these shoes I work in IT so I am going to test these shoes today at work and see how they handle walking for 9 hours Thank you Nike Hey send ya boy some of those promotions codes please Yall be acting stingy for all the money I spend with yall I would hate to spend else where But thank you again and peace out

I have over a dozen recently purchased Nike shoes including Air Max 2015 2017 Flyknit Air Max Free Huarache and others This shoe is by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned The only other shoes that come close in comfort are Huarache not ultra and air force 1 duck boot low but these two shoes do not fit as well as the Vapor Utility I highly recommend

Slick fancy comfortable appealing this shoe was worth my 19 99 Took them out to Mexico City and walked up the pyramids and no blisters no discomfort I also had people tell me hey man nice expensive shoes NOT 19 99 brother Best purchase in a lifetime thanks finish line and Lacoste you guys rocked my world

There is not a lot to say Great quality great price perfect servicexe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f

I love them best shoes I have brought in a long time and came on time

I got these for my son who is in high school I needed a pair of shows to quickly slip on and off These are great they are light and the colors match everything he wears Very comfortable for a kid that has very low arches Also I did go up half a size to accommodate for the extra width he likes to have due to his flat fleet

have wide feet go up at least a half size

This shoe is VERY soft and COMFORTABLE I bought them for my fianc xc3 xa9 and he LOVED them

Great every day shoe I purchased the all black Indescreet way to wear black shoes and be comfortable A bit narrow but that is why I buy Nike and own about 10 pairs

My son is usually quite hard to pick for but I think I did good with these He absolutely loves them

I bought it only for running purpose They are soft light weight and stylish as well It gives comfort to my ankle and toe while I am running I just loved it

This shoe is super comfortable for walking around and it looks really good I have received lots of compliments from people who think that the shoe looks awesome These are not the shoes I generally use for running however I run cross country on muddy trails and gravel surfaces and I feel like they might not be super useful for that In conclusion I would not buy as a distance running shoe but they are a good walk around in shoe because they are comfortable they look amazing and the price is right

Have several vapormax plus and vapormax 2 but the 3 is insane it fits like a glove I LOVE THESE SHOES Trying to find that fuschia laser orange in my size they are FIRE

I am a fan of vapormax and this 3 0 vapormax has to be my very favorite So slick stylish and comfortable IF YOUR THINKING OF GETTING A NEW PAIR OF KICKS I RECOMMEND THIS ONE

Nike is love

The flyknit weave really hugs your foot and the vapormax sole is very comfortable has great grip and stability Great fit and great look

I recommend that you purchase a larger size for your size

These shoes are awkward at first because of the sole However after a couple of wears they are VERY comfortable They are great for running or and any cross fit type of workouts My biggest complaint is that they do not hold up very well The front of my shoe has a whole in the fabric after having them for a year This is very disappointing considering I do not wear them everyday My niece has purchased 2 pairs both of which ripped in a short period of time about 3 months If this issue with the fabric is fixed I would consider purchasing another pair

I have been wearing Vapormax since 2017 They are a really comfortable shoe I recently bought a 2019 version and the shoe has evolved It feels more supportive and the comfort factor is still there to make it feel like you are wearing socks

I have been a fan of the Nike VaporMax sneakers it is just something different than the same old Jordans Ultraboost and any other sneaker that everyone wears The flyknit is definitely more sturdier and feels great on feet

Great looking shoe wanted for a while sold out only reason for keeping would 5 star for the shoe itself

I love the style and fit of the air max 1 I am looking forward to new color ways that nike releases

Great shoe love the Nike brand And this is my 4th pair of Nikes However this particular style runs small particularly the width Go up half a size to compensate

Nike did a great job bringing a great shoe from the 80s back to life The shoe fits pretty well and they are very comfortable I hope the people at Nike keep up the good work

Great looking shoe and comfortable for the price point The shoes are a tad bit tight but Im sure they will break in Those with wider feet like myself should go up half a size though

I need orange shoes for work The only reason I was interested in these shoes was for the color I was sent the wrong color because my size was was not available do not send me what I did not order just to make me go through the trouble of returning it Arrogant self serving and not helpful

I bought these because I need plain white shoes So far havent had any problems with the product

Got these for everyday wear to office and they are a very comfortable and stylish shoe Highly recommend

I love the way these shoes look and feel They are extremely comfortable The only thing I do not love about these shoes is that one of them makes a squeaking sound while walking Other than that I would definitely recommend buying these shoes

The App and website suck For 3 orders in a row I attempted to utilize a 20 winner Circle reward Each time the award appeared to be processed only not to be processed in the email notice of the completed order Moreover the rewards were removed from my account The online chat is not operational No one responded to my emails I had to call several times until I got someone that actually understood what was going on and was willing to help me I can not be the only one this is happening to

Very comfortable shoes and at a reasonable price I could wear these everyday

Havent even had these shoes one week and they already have a really annoying squeak when you step So glad I spent so much money on these Should have just found a cheap pair of shoes somewhere Probably would have lasted longer

what is with the squeaky noise coming from this shoeObviously a design flaw since I am not the only one reporting it My wife also had the same model of shoe and it too squeaked right out of the box Very comfortable but will not buy again due to the noise

I have had 3 pair of these I am a active person average anywhere from 3 to 8 miles 5 days a week The problem I have with these shoes is that they are noisy for one I do not know why but at the back of the heel on the top on every pair I have the material is tearing That is why I give this shoe a not durable rating The tear is uncomfortable and is ruining my socks

These hurt my feel really really bad I wore them around the house for about 3 hours to break them in I had to take them off because of the extreme discomfort I have regular feet

Very comfy second pair I have bought Really love them for work I am on my feet all day Only issue and reason for 3 star is that the sole squeaks on every flat surface as if it were a ball court Worse than that they make a squeegee type sound from the heel with every step

This is one of the best value shoes I have ever purchased in my life it is comfortable it is stable and provides above average arch support I also like that it is somewhat lightweight with a decent toebox So why only 4 starsBecause it squeaks I bought the grey one and it started squeaking after 1 week I returned and bought the white one grey no longer in stock and that squeaked on the first dayNikeplease look into the manufacturing process for this shoe Other than that it is great but alas I must return this one also

Jordan 1s are timeless and look better the more you wear them same goes for comfort they are obviously no ultraboost or something but for a Jordan 1 these are it family

Great colorway overall The green suede on the upper is a nice washed out blue green color which matches well with the off white tone of the leather Multiple lace options allow for different styles an extra I always appreciate

The shoes are made of great quality and are also comfortable I am glad I was able to purchase a pair They also comes with extra laces This colorway is nice in person It definitely stands out but is not too loud It is a perfect pair to wear during spring

Jordan 1run a bit big so i would go half size down Truly are not that comfortable compared to other shoes but always gotta rep the 1 

I stick with the clean white laces always breaking necks when I wear them out

Best Jordan out there Always get a half a size down and you are golden

it is jordan 1

Loved the sneakers I bought both of the ying and yang pack I had got them for a great deal but again on one of my other reviews my sneaker boxes keep arriving damaged

These things are clean Same nice material as bred 1s but in a beautiful blue hue

got 2 pairs just for myself one to keep and one to wear

Great shoe but how is it possible that your website goes down and others are able to buy the shoe Not a great service

Nice all black with gum sole Got two cus day hot boy

Finally picked up a pair of AJ1 Fit is good They were true to size and look good

I love that even the kids sizes came with different lace color options as well Dope sneaker they look better on feet

Strong smell of glue and full of crease Good looking but poorly made So disappointed

I have not seen retros that look so close to original release kicks ever These look like deadstock originals that were kept in a vault Perfect execution Nike you crazy for this 1

Cant really go wrong with Jordan 1 highs its rare to find a pair of sneakers that the more you wear it the more the wear and tear show the better a shoe looks Casually you can wear it with anything can not wait for the Pine Green and Purple toes to come out

The only Jordans that I wear are the 1and these did not disappoint I love how they reflect the camo once the light hits them Nothing but a bunch of compliments from a lot of people that see them

I purchased the Red Suede AJ1s around Christmas 17 and they are extremely comfortable but are very hard to get on and off The suede does hold up pretty well although I have been avoiding snow and water The retro look gets lots of good comments and are great for basketball I love them

First pair of Jpretty comfortable and nice clean look These do crease but so do all leather shoes so if you are concerned about that you could get some crease guards if they bother you that much These run a bit large but not to the point where I could not wear them so for the most part it is true to size Only thing I am not crazy about is the weight which feels heavy compared to my other shoes but it is to be expected

I really did not like the fit but its ok but otherwise its great

I wear various pairs of 1depending on my activity plan I ordered a pair of these because the subtle camo bit was interesting to me and I was intrigued When the shoes arrived the grey on grey was a nice aesthetic for me Then I saw the shoes change when light caught them differently I have gotten more compliments on these shoes compared to other pairs I wear except for my 12everyone loves my 12and they fit exactly the way I want them to

I have nothing but love for Jordan 1s and as beautiful as this looks in pictures is exactly what it is IN PICTURES did not live up to the hype with this color way it is much more dull and boring than the picture does not go well with light color jeans As far as comfort you can not go wrong with Nike Jordan brand

These shoes are really shiny and I said this about the Jordan 1 Re3pects most of the shoes Ive ordered from nike com have been fresh clean new sneaks so you have to adjust the laces depending on the width of your foot but these Jordan 1s fit a lot better and were easier to adjust compared to the Jordan 1 re3pects im satisfied with my purchase and I have the new Florida gators training shoe coming tomorrow Im really excited and happy with the quick and fast service online thank you nike cant wait to shop for more shoes and apparel in the future

Love this show so much I cannot believe it I could live without the creases but because thats not possibly I have learned to accept it Also I got the all white Yin Yang Jordan 1 so it gets a lil dirty but I still love it I love how I can wear it casual but also dress it up a bit

My first pair of AJ1Love them But i should get half size up

Overall this is a great shoe The grey ones are more grey in person and the orange is also brighter But I really love these shoes

It was as real as shown in the picture amazing grip very comfortable to wear looking superb perfect fit i loved it it is awsome

Been waiting too long to own a pair of the original Jordans Fits great Got a size 15 since Nike tends to fit tighter than other brands Will only wear these to style and profile since I have another pair of Nikes for the court

The picture does his shoe too many favors The tongue on the shoe is a weird plastic material on the outside and mine came very wrinkled It just does not look to great in person Still has a good fit and is most definitely durable with the full leather with exception to the tongue

The shoes look much nicer when on hand than on the website When I opened the box I could smell the recently manufactured scent They looked awesome as they lay sideway opposite to each other Because I use a special thin cast boot I had to order a 1 2 size bigger than my true size I laced the shoes with both laces included red and white When I stepped into these shoes they were a nice fit I could not tell they were half size bigger 11 5 vs 11 0 I got many complements from my family My grandkids loved them so much that they kept telling me I should buy them a pair They are 4 boys It would be too expensive The inside of the shoe feels comfortable although the insole could have been made better with a bit more cushion Luckily I have Dr Scholls inserts430 so with them the shoe feels awesome Yes I am still at the stage where I keep looking at them to make sure they still look new The quality seems very good Hopefully it will be a pair that will last for a long while

I love Jordan 1s they are a very classic but still trend setting pair of sneakers The fit is great the color is pretty cool also especially if you were not able to get your hands on the SHATTEREDS Overall great quality sneaker looking forward to the WING 1s

I love wearing these shoes and they are my new favorites I reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for something new

Love these A1s the color way is crazy and they are must have staple to the wardrobe

These shoes are definitely the best shoes I bought from Nike They are very comfortable and was shipped to me in no time I love these shoes for the fact that they are also very stylish I do not wear these for basketball but they would be great for ball considering the fact that these shoes have great ankle support I would definitely recommend these to anyone else

recommend half size up These are iconic kicks that will stand the test of time

Just buy it Shoes are comfortable Runs slightly small but a great shoe

I would not say this shoe is the most comfortable but it is very stylish and durable They can be worn everyday as beaters and still remain looking good while doing so

One of the greatest colorways on the greatest shoe of all time Plus remastered how can you go wrong

The Jordan 1 usually creases at the toe but that is a given Even with the regular crease the sneaker is very comfortable I have like 8 pairs of 1and they are all great can not wait for more colors

This shoe is great very comfortable and very stylish as well Never owned a pair of air Jordan retro before but I gotta say Ill be definitely coming back and getting more of these shoes

Hope this helped

Its a little hard to fit into mostly for my left foot I wear a size 13 14 but once its on its cool The thing i did not like though is the first time i put them on it creased it on the front I did not go outside or anything i was trying them on and they creased Other than that its a decent shoe I like the color Deep Royal White Black I would not recommend this though Mostly due to the fact that it creased the moment i tried it on

Its a great shoe very comfy and all of sudden fam

This is a spectacular shoe The heel is a bit stiff but with a bit of wear it becomes incredibly comfortable

This is hands down the best shoe in my collection Comfortable and easy to wear Came in 2 days when selected 4 day shipping 10 10

The 2016 AJ1Banned are too good and worth too much to wear and look great next to my other 1but herethe major problem I have with them they look even better on And they feel awesome This makes them too good NOT to wear No other sneaker is such an easy no brainer to kick about in The tumbled leather of these and the shattered backboard away game help it mould to my feet so perfectly The leather on the Letterman colorway feels a little tighter when slipping them on and off Both type are great at the end of the day Glad I got those options so hopefully they will each last longer than last years shattered backboard which I slept ate walked and ran in 24 7 until I had to force myself to put them on the shelf right before sole would about to give under the ball of my foot Love them all

Looks awesome only problem is that it creases fast Super Comfy

The shoes themselves have great quality but when i laced them up i noticed that the top lace hole was missing on the inside of one of the shoes I do not think its worth returning over but if you have a 11 5 in the black toe Jordan 1s than ill take an exchange LOL

Jordan 1 OG leather in a PERFECT color combination you can not go wrong with this shoe

The most prolific iconic athletic wear in history The first of it is kind Simply timeless for any era or outing I have never owned a pair of banned 1s but I am aware of the comfortability of the shoe and can definitely tell you it is worth the purchase

What more can I say the GOAT wore it and I am glad to see that Nike Jordan Brand are putting quality back into the product 10 10

These are the sneakers that come around every so often I am 54 and the Nike culture has been pass on to my sons They are all I wear the Jordan 1are pretty much my favorites No other product besides Nike is all in our house hold I am a trend setter and everyone follows the call me the one king I do however wear other numbers

I like that bronze nike logo and dry leather That shoes are durable to Gonna be my daily shoes

No matter how old this shoe is it will always outshine most other shoes in terms of looks and quality I cannot get over how clean they are either and when you got the other nike gear to go with them you will be looking fresh bro

This is a classic silhouette and is stylish and timeless Looks good with pretty much everything

I have bought several pairs of the 1s over the past years and so far the gold standard are the Shattered Backboards This pair is along the lines of the Carolina 1s Metallic Blue 1s and very comfortable There should be no need for you to break these in at all

The style is on point Im personally a fan of the Retro lines and this is one of my favorites This shoe is durable and stylish and a great buy

Great release good materials and build quality Durable

This Air Jordan 1 has a simple color way but packs a powerful punch The leather quality could of been better but its nothing to complain over The red Nike Air tag on the tongue was the icing on the cake for me The Air Jordan 1 has always been one of my favorite silhouettes so this whole review may be a little basis All in all this is a solid shoe

This shoe is very clean and has great materials you can wear with anything

nice color for the Jordan 1 simple black and white instant classic

I have owned many Air Jordans and the leather on this pair is some of the best I have encountered The pair has a great grain to the leather and the shape of the shoe is more reminiscent of the original than many Air Jordan I retros of the recent past

Just what I wanted Very good product I use them for everything

Leather is unbelievable quality One of the most comfortable shoes I own

It feels cheap and not remastered I do not like that they charge more money for poor quality

Air Jordan 1 is overall a great looking sneaker nice color way

Very great looking shoe I recomend going true to size or even a half size down Comfortable shoe and durable The more you wear Jordan 1s the better they look in my opinion

First Jordan shoes that I wear to play basketball and is really nice No complaints

People sleeping on these joints Leather is on point and its a classic color way in white or black Yall be on it though if it was some limited collab rightSMH 1s is always on point

Quality materials on a classic silhouette cant beat a Jordan 1 and this color way is clean

These are classic Jordans and this is a great colorway Simple and classic They fit is good and I like the fact that they come with both black and white laces for some variety

The Jordan 1 is my favorite sneaker of all time This all white color way is so sleek and looks great on feet

Its a very good shoe You could do anything you want in them

This shoe is Amazing from the beginning when they first dropped to now they have stayed true to Jordans idea of the retro 1 amazing for sneaker heads everywhere and for respect in general you cant wear these shoes without someone commenting on them

It is a great shoe If you are looking for that classic retro 90s look this is it You might wanna think about buying two pairsone for the retro dirty look and the second for the clean fresh look

Very cool looking and great comfort Found they ran a little wide But still love them Dark colored sole is bonus for keeping super white shoes looking clean

These shoes are great for playing basketball right after my 5 mile run every other day they are very comfortable on the sole of my feet and they are not heavy at all I love my AJ1s

I can wear these with mostly anything They have a true comfort and I enjoy their look

air Jordan 1 classic shoe It a every day shoe when it gets dirty it still looks good I love when nike bought this colorway back I love the color white navy this colorway is simple and it goes with anything I recommend this shoe to everyone because it a classic the fit is right and it you can not go wrong with this colorway

This show is as good as I thought they would be Awesome style

If ur a sneaker head you will love these to review and wear

Very impressed with the quality of the shoe and the quickness of the delivery Nike is always a winner in my book

This is a simple super clean retro of an OG colorway Goes great with really any outfit and white to me is such a summer color

These are the OG shoes that cemented my Nike love Jordan 1 and this colorway embodies the perfect summer court shoe There colorway is clean and the materials are up to nikes high standard These shoes could rock the ball court indoors and outdoors with also being able to be worn with a tux Jordan 1 needs to have its own place in history because of the HYPEBEAST IT HAS CAUSED Its not just a shoe its a movement on a global scale Actually never scale greatness so its universal Nike keep up the good work and thanks Tinker for keeping them fresh

The classic Air Jordan 1 silhouette returns in a OG colorway that has not been seen in 30 years The upper feature a high quality soft leather along with a white mid sole and navy blue bottom sole the shoe also comes with navy blue interchangeable laces A perfect summer shoe

The Air Jordan 1 is a very famous shoe Its a great pair of sneakers Very nice clean comfortable and a must have for sneaker enthusiast especially OG colorways like the Metallic Navy

excellent shoe very comfortable great leather quality on most retro 1s They do run a little big

My go to shoes are always the Jordan 1s This particular pair is top notch due to the metallic hue of some parts of the shoe It gives the shoe a unique look while still delivering comfort and style

Love the shoe I would definitely buy again Fits ideal

I was surprised how comfortable these are Although they are not built for playing basketball anymore like in the old days they are still very nice to have in my collection

Classic silhouette in an OG color way You cant go wrong with these The metallic blue accents really pop against the crisp white

I love thr material it feel durable and long last as compaired to previous veriosions of the jordan 1

Fresh pair of ones Great color scheme for any season

As a Air Jordan collector this model and color way I couldnt pass on I actually bought two pairs one to rock one to stock Keep putting out gems Nike

Great shoes looks and smells fresh I love the metallic and leather is good and it fits great

Execellent shoe These stay true to original form

Great quality Good shoe for casual wear and I would recommend these shoes

I love the experience nike com always is Great shoe from a great company

Classic metallic series comes back for the first time in true OG form 1986 I was 9 and Ive never seen anybody wear this series even til today Great quality no glue marks and a perfect fit thank you Nike and Jordan brand

The shoe was great but the white would get a little stained from my jeans

These shoes are amazing They have great quality material wise and are unbelievably comfortable I have very little problems with the shoe other than minor scuff marks at the heel but those can be easily wiped away All in all I recommend this product to anyone looking for a durable and fashionable shoe

Love the shoe very roaming and comfortable nice leather quality

they are exactly what I expected Clean shoe looks just like the pics

Its going to be my summer sneakers and I need a new pair of Jordan 1s

Cant go wrong with a pair of Jordan 1 OGs Leather quality is great Highly recommended

As I was lucky enough to score the Chicago OG High ones these were an awesome addition to my collection At first I was worried how will the qualify be and then Nike gives me an early Christmas gift Thanks 10000

Typical Jordan Retro 1 with the remastered materials A clean classic looking sneaker that is definitely worth adding to your collection

The designing of these shoes were amazing They are very comfortable shoes I wish I can be more select it by Nike in the sneaker draw

My dad had the 1985 pair and Ive got these now Great shoes

First and foremost id like to say that im glad nike jordan brand is bringing back some original colorways of the air jordan 1 This particular color is a perfect summertime shoe Probably the closest to real leather that ive seen on an air jordan 1 release since the shattered backboard My favorite thing about this shoe is its versatility practically goes with anything from a fashion standpoint For what it is its also a decent performer on court as well just replace the insoles with something with more cushion and youre good to go A classic sneaker like this never goes out of style

I love the classic design of the Jordan 1 It looks good with any type of outfit Even when they are beat up and creased it still looks amazing and gives that vintage OG look They run a bit narrow so if you have a wide foot go a half size up

This product is awesome I love the comfort and quality

Perfect pair from the OG collection Copped two pairs just for the summer time

Love the material and the quality of the shoe CB wait to wear during Cowboys football season

I buy my shoes solely to collect but when I wear them the Jordan 1s are a neutral look and they are not bad on the comfort side

The materials used for this shoe are really nice smooth do not crease bad in the midfoot

Jordan Brand did an an excellent job bringing back this retro for the first time Only complaint I have is this Color way runs big I wear a Size 10 in all my Jordan 1and for some reason this Size 10 runs very big I highly recommend you going down at least half a size from your normal true to size fit

I am a big fan of the OG Air Jordan 1 the quality is up there it came with no flaws and they are so soft

The shoe itself is very eye catching and get complements from everybody because they stand out from the crowd and they last forever This is my second pair of ones Ive had my other ones for a couple of years and theyve lasted a while but these ones have better materials and wont doubt theyll last longer very pleased with my purchase and you wont regret it if you get a pair

Great quality Great shoe Overall great product as usual

Definitely a comfortable shoe never can go wrong with a retro jordan

This color way is so clean and sharp My favorite part is the colors Metallic blue is FIRE I love to wear this shoes with jeans everyday AJ 1 OG is always right

If youre from NY and youre a Yankee fan youll love this shoe It goes with all your Yankee jerseys and hats The shoe is just really dope I love 1s

Durable shoe great for any occasion I highly recommend this product

Classics Super pysched I was able to get a pair

This shoe is one of my all time favorites so I was glad to be able to purchase them on release day

The white with the metallic blue is a great summer addition to any shoe lineup The air jordan 1 is a great classic look Comfortable fit with the leather that is soft compared to earlier models of the AJ 1

Nice Sneaker Playing ball is a dream in this sneaker

One of my favorite OG color ways honestly worth every penny of you love the columbias or any white and navy color way Comes with a navy lace for a classy lace swap so it doesnt make it look too much of a white shoe Runs true to size I recommend getting a half size smaller so that the toe box doesnt crease as much

This Air Jordan was my first when I was a kid I had to purchase this shoe Brings back memories of the good ole days

Wish they were not so narrow but these are classic High quality

Its very comfortable I would recommend this to anyone Loving the details and how simple it looks Im a fan of the Jordans 1 and definitely awaiting the next color scheme

Looks good Feels good The color is nice Excellent addition to my collection

Amazing quality leather on these and the OG feel to them was great

Overall great shoe Quality is getting better No glue stains Nice leather used Sufficient amount made Fast shipping Great experience

I would recommend these to anyone that likes style and a classic colorway I have not worn then much maybe 1x They are very comfortable love the colorway of them They are not ment to run in they are more of a walk around shoe thats just my personal opinion They run true to size in a 13 14 and I got a 13 they fit nice I like my shoes to be a little snug not much breathing room so if you like more room go with the size that always fits you best would recommend to anyone that just loves shoes like I do

They are really comfy shoes The leather on these are so soft you do not have to worry about breaking them in The metallic blue from 85 are very nice and the retro box is a nice touch

I would recommend this shoe to anyone who wants comfort and durability out of a basketball shoe

Just as the title says this is a great shoe Great style and comfort

glad the some of the original jordan 1 color ways are coming back great quality shoe

Classic colorway Jordan 1s are much improved with the remastered treatment I will be wearing these into the ground this summer

Fits very well which is why I prefer Jordans 1s when ever I feel the need to purchase jordans lol

Simple and clean looking shoe can never go wrong the Jordan 1

The Jordan 1 is a very comfortable and stylish shoe

Great quality shoe is very durable and runs true to size overall a very nice shoe

I love this color Great for the spring The leather on this is very nice Cant wait for the next OG color way

I love these shoes Nothing beats original color ways with Jordans or Nikes The quality is superb Nike did a great job with this one

I love this shoe it is very comfortable and I would recommend this shoe to anyone and everybody

A nice OG color retro made with good materials Will definitely last Highly recommend it

Shoe is amazing quality is A1 everything is good they just run slightly large so Im gonna swap mine for an 11 5 Honestly if I were sitting on a few extra dollars Id invest in these

The air Jordan 1 is my all time favorite sneaker It brings me back to my child hood memories and can go well with any outfit They are comfortable and do turn heads when your out and about

I wear these casually with shorts or jeans Great looking shoe and they last forever

Always been one of my favorites So classic and retro One of the nicest looking sneakers with the swoosh

Ive always been a fan of Retro 1 Jordans One of the most simplest shoe that pretty much goes with any outfit The simplicity of the Retro 1 makes it stand out Nike stepped up with materials this shoe is made out of Im extremely happy with it Who ever came up with the colors is a genius The Jordan Retro 1s never disappoint

Classic shoe was a must have for me Fresh for the summer

Great shoe First retro of this colorway Quality is getting better

Color coordinates with alot of my clothes I would wear them everyday

I like this jordan model the best because it holds up over time The jordan shoe for style and comfort

If youve owned Jordan 1s before you know they are built like a tank Very durable and hard wearing Og white and metallic navy colorway looks great Leather quality is awesome as well Be warned they run a little large Im usually a size 12 I bought both a size 12 and eleven and a half and the 11 1 2 fits perfect Cant go wrong with a pair of og 1s

A few blemishes coming out of the box so quality control was not up to par with other 1 releases Heavy glue smell coming out that was so strong I had to air it out over a week

Cant go wrong with this OG classic colorway Love this shoe

Waited a long time for these to come back Worth the wait do not sleep on these Great shoe

Great shoe great company Highly recommended and the fitament is great

You could never go wrong with these Jordans because they are a classic and this color way goes well with everything

these shoes are great They get dirty easily if you do not know to keep your shoes clean

overall a great looking classic jordan 1 my only issue as usual is the quality control leather is comparable to the chicago 1not too stiff or plasticky but nothing near the SBB 1quality there is an obnoxious double stitch on the toebox and the paint on the sole is sloppy not sure how these pass CC inspection comfortable and clean and great pair for the summertime

This is my Favorite silhouette they look even better the more you wear them

Being a timeless classic and clean sneaker the air Jordan 1 has always been one of my absolute favorites The letterman colorway absolutely pops and is an awesome colorway in my opinion Perfect for upcoming july 4 and has minimal errors on the shoe The quality on the leather is good but they crease easily When they crease though they look better in my opinion They are also extremely durable and if you wanted to it could be worn in rain snow or grass without it being damaged in any way making that a HUGE plus for the shoe Overall great release Nike

This is a very nice shoe have not worn yet I want A second pear

Shoes look smell and feel great An OG colorway and an AJ1 can not get any more classic and retro than this

Shoe is a little long in the toe when ordering TTS but fits perfect everywhere else Very comfortable and no cons other than the shoe being long in the toe Will see the durability of this timeless classic over the next few months of wearing it

Love theses The color scheme the comfort and the throwback tribute to the original AJ 1s Couldnt be happier

this is by far one of the best sneakers Ive ever owned and its also just a beautiful shoe to look at

Unique The quality is amazing The color combination is on

These are a beautiful shoe Im bout to buy a second pair The light crimson red is amazing and they used good leather they hardly crease almost as good as the broken backboard leather I love these was waiting awhile for them to drop and Im def ordering a 2nd pair while I can everyone is sleeping on one of the dopest realeased of the year

Had the shoe for a year now and still runnin strong A quality

This product has been a very reliable shoe for a long time As a sneakerhead I have loved them very much Since they have been my daily driver I have worn them out to the point where the exterior leather is falling off and the sole has fallen out I would not recommend them for hard use but for lighter less active use looks basketball or extensive use for less time enjoy These are great Also side note they are very comfortable but after they are as worn as much as I have they have slowly been becoming less comfortable

Although the white can get easily dirty I find that wearing these shoes on the reg is quite satisfying My feet are well covered stylish and Im ready to dunk on anyone in my way I loosened up the laces to make them slip ons and now with the 3 attachable detachable tongue covers I got the hottest shoes on da block

Ordered these shoes for my boyfriend right before Christmas they arrived on time and looked great The colors are great and the fit perfect

Like this sneakers a lot Its a classic causal sneaker that can me worn with anything

The shoe is primarily my comfortable after work weekend shoe Works with any classic look I rocked it to a holiday party with jeans and blazer and looked like a million bucks it is a great grade of leather they use for this model It felt a little narrow upon initial wear but was fine after I broke them in a bit

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my little brother 21 years old He loved his gift He wears it every day and says that the shoes are very comfortable

The retro sneaker was a hit with my son Very classy act to the past

I love this product This style is so cool It is exactly what I hoped

Really comfortable and casual looks with the cool features from the rare edition Sneakers lovers got to cop these Jordan 1s

Only bought for style and swag no ballin in these Also they are a very stiff shoe

Waiting for 3s to be released again

These Air Jordan 1s just like many other pairs I have ordered from Nike are really comfortable and durable for many different uses I love the color way the style and the fit Its not too loose and not too Tight its just right and anyone would be honored to have a pair of these

Great sneaker and love the gold on them they are great addition to the Jordan brand

a little too big than actual size i usually wear and the price is acceptable great shoes

Got this for my boyfriend he loves it Would definitely get another one

Prompt shipping and delivery the product was well represented online very satisfied with the product once I received it easy ordering and hassle free processing

These Jordan 1s are clean and fit great Can go with any outfit and leather quality is good Definitely recommend this shoe as a daily worn Jordan 1

Nice sneaker would highly recommend to wear out and about

I bought these jordans that appears on the website blue and orange but when i reveived them they were blue and pink

The design of this shoe is PERFECT You never can go wrong with the Jordan brand especially Jordan 1The navy and baby blue compliment each other so well

I love this shoe The shoe is super cute I am a female and it looks good with leggings

Classic model Great color For is true to size can not go wrong with any Jordan 1

Great sneakers very comfortable and very nice and love the colors

The shoe is really comfortable and fits true to size

Nice color way goes with a lot of different looks Quality materials and craftsmanship too Toe box runs a bit narrow so order a half size up if you have wide feet

The shoes are very nice They are very comfortable

This is a great shoe and great color way When I first saw this I knew I had to have them The Jordan 1are the best and nothing can compare to them Fit on this shoe was great and really comfortable

Classic shoes in a great color way The tumbled leather is amazing on this shoe

This product is very durable but I mostly use it for casual wear and not for basketball or shoot around in the gym because it is a very durable shoe and I like to wear them to school the toebox is also a very smug fit and if you like a loose fit and natural feel in the toebox then I would recommend going up half a size but overall I would rate it a 9 5 out of 10 Also the heel counter feels like memory foam So it is a great shoe in my perspective

HIGH OG ENOUGH SAID THIS SHOE IS SIMPLE YET EYE CATCHING I LOVE SIMPLE COLORWAYS YOU DID IT AGAIN NIKE TY LEATHER MATERIAL IS OUTSTANDING

 grade shoenever enough sizes Horrible quality

Love this most greatest shoe Best jordan ever

I liked everything about this shoes but the suede part I could smell too much of chemical stuff I had to return it

Poor dab brand hit a home run with this shoe The color way material and the suede they use are A plus A must have in anyone Jordan collection

One of my favorites retros of all time I called RG3

The shoes have a long long history The design is really classic Shoes are of good quality However the forward bottom is relatively thin

Comfortable and classic Jordan look Very pleased

The Jordan 1 is an awesome shoe it is comfortable and you can where it with anything

I am a fan of the Jordan 1st they are a bit big but they are great overall not the best but very good

awesome shoe i have tried time and time again to get it but no luck Please restock people will buy so keep producing the product for the sake of sneaker heads

its a nice shoe and its so comfortable I wear them with my friends and they do not get dirty How much times have you had an orange shirt but no orange shoes to match it Its happened to me plenty of times

i like this nike because it seems to be durable comfortable and etc nikes are really good shoes because they really take shoes to the next level

Nice shoe looks good with jeans or shorts Nice for the fall colorway is different from retro 1in the past

This is a beautiful shoe period This was my first Jordan Brand shoe and I love them This shoe goes with anything even dress pants

I love this shoe since i the 1st time i saw it worth the money and very happy with my purchase this shoe is perfect if you are not into bright color clothes the texture of this is the reason why i immediately bought coz it remind me of the elephant skin perfect all the way around with shorts and denim jeans

Great shoes very comfortable and stylish can go with many looks

Great looking shoe Very comfortable There have been many colorways of the Jordan I This one is one of the better ones Very simple but it looks great even better in person The pictures do not do justice to how nice these look The black leather is soft and supple and will only look better with some wear The shadow grey has subtle detail that makes this shoe a head turner My favorite realease of the Jordan I other than the original coloways You will not be disappointed with this purchase

these shoes are clasic high top ones are amazing and i actuaally found them in my size they look awsome with jeans or bball shorts awesome all around

I do not know how this shoe is still in stock if i could I would get every pair in my size from 7 8 in every single colorway this DTRT stuff does not mean anything it is an exact retro of the metallics from 1985 I can not get enough of them the leather is a little different then normal but the Jumpman hang tag looks perfect =would Thank You Nike

got this package for next school year this a raw package for a low number

I like the shoe classic look Also the gum sole was a eye catcher Plenty of compliments good buy for the price

I needed slides that have the soft bottom cushion and adjustable strap These were perfect and had a great price

These were very comfortable until I got them wet The foam pads absorb moisture If you were these barefoot or get them wet they will stink and it is very difficult to get the smell out Even after airing them out after every use and trying multiple options to de stink them they still stink If you are looking for a slide that can get wet DO NOT purchase these

I will only buy these sandals as I have had several pairs of them and love them

they are comfortable however I found they broke disappointingly fast The foam where my toes sit became flat and feels cheap now The material covering the foam is ripping and the top half of the material is ripping off This is after two months of wear I would stick with regular hard surface slides

After two weeks the right sandals heel has sunk tremendously Very disappointing

I have purchased 3 pairs of these slides now to just throw them away in less than a year If they get wet they smell worse than raw sewage

Comfortable affordable but durability side nothing comparable with my Playmaker After a summer the fabric torn

I have purchased this product before and because I liked them so much I decided to purchase them again but this time the UA logo fell off in a month from purchasing them This is really disappointing because I am used to high quality from the UA brand

I have had these sandals for about a week and the material over the padding is loose The foam in the right sandal is barley there it feels like im wearing 2 different sandals after a week feels to me like poor materials

They are super comfy But we are to small for the person I ordered them for So looks like I gained a pair of slides Will be ordering some in a 12

Now I have owned a pair of ignite slipons in the past and I love them so naturally I was excited to get my hands on another pair They arrived quickly and in alright condition there is a faint yellow paint stain on one The moment I tried them on I was happy with how comfortable they were and impressed at how well they fit my foot Unfortunately how perfectly they fit around the outline of my foot was not a good thing Everytime I take a step in these sandals they slip and I end up walking with my heels on the ground it is incredibly frustrating and tightening them does not seem to help what so ever

As for as a flip flop style shoe is concerned comfort is key Highly cushioned sole provides support walking on hard surfaces and the adjustable strap does not wear or irritate your skin Perfect fit per sized ordered

Very comfortable Memory foam soles make them a great choice for a lightweight breathable slide

Super comfortable My sons second pair He outgrew his old ones and wanted the same ones

 ua 4d memory foam feel good

I bought these for my son and he loves them They are his favorite go to shoes for summer time In fact this year he wanted 2 pairs They are a great shoe for the decent price of them They hold up all he puts them through

I have bought two of these pairs of slides and absolutely love them

Very comfortable and at a great price The fit is just right

Still as comfortable as any 99X shoe Too bad the looks go downhill with each iteration Been rocking these since 996

This was an excellent cop to say the least

I been a true fan of this shoes I have about 6 pairs of them They are very comfortable light weight and I can wear them on most the occasions

Bought for my 17yr old He loves this shoeand finish line because of the great deals

Maybe I am used to the lighter Nikes they make nowadays but these AF1s are pretty heavy Does that stop me from wearing themNope Queue Nelly

Fresh pair of all white forces is a must have

He really likes these shoes He said they are comfortable it is about time to lower that price though

This is the perfect sneaker for the summer you can wear them with anything they also have a very good fit and are comfortable

Had to go down a size for my son other than that they are perfect

The Air Force One is a classic especially the white on white color way It does have a pretty thick sole about one inch thick Nevertheless it is still pretty comfortable and I would recommend anyone to pick up a pair They match pretty easily with most outfits and are pretty comfortable

My 15 year old son is picky and all about looks He wears these all white ones a lot and they look really nice I will probably buy these in all black for him also

Excellent got not as quick as they said but ok and wish in future not just dropping off at front door people steal

I had purchased these shoes for my husband because he has been wanting some in all black He loved them

My honey loves these and we always replace them when needed A few weeks ago I bought him the all black ones online and they came in perfect condition Also I used my reward so that makes it even better Waiting til the all white ones are available in his size to buy those too

I have a disabled adult son and this is the ONLY shoe he will wear Every time he wears them out I buy another pair Great shoes

Item was purchased for my husband and he love them

Favorite shoes of all time Will always own a pair of theses

These have like no comfort feel like bricks but look good traditional hispanic shoe in east dallas so caught on with the hype in 7th im in 10th and still wearing i recomend you get force fields from footlocker to prevent creasing

He had me get them for school Brought them for him last year Good investment for my money

I bought these for my younger cousin and he loved them He had no complaints He was satisfied and so was I money well spent

My fianc xc3 xa9 loved them was a FatherDay Gift for my man

These AF1are very comfortable and can be worn all day with no issues They are easy to clean and they look good

I like this particular brand so much I have two pair

Blue oh BlackPeople ask at nite Lime the colorway comfy great with jeans

These are a decent pair of white casual sneakers Only gripe is that they run a bit too tight at first

I order 13its my correct shoe size but i lowkey forgot Air Force 1s run a lil big kinda need a 12 1 2 but im good

This is a nice looking durable shoe It is a little bulky and heavy so better for casual wear It is also a little narrow so not great comfort for my wider flat foot

Love this shoe bought it cause I loved the color

My son needed a pair of shoes just for a Casual wear and these were perfect I got a bargain Two in One

I ordered them online and once they got to the house one shoe looked new and the left shoe looked worn with slide creases already forming with out me wearing them

Sneakers were 2 different shades of red One looked faded almost orange and the other was true red Bought as a gift Was disappointed and returned them

So when they are on sale i buy them

Great looking casual shoe to wear everyday with my jeans thank you

This shoe is a must have if you like old school style It is extremely comfortable looks great and has a timeless feel that never seems to go out of style I would recommend however that you order a 1 2 size smaller than normal I usually wear an 11 but went with a 10 5 It fits perfectly

Amazing style quick shipping and a super good deal This was my first purchase from finishline and I was impressed They have a great selection of AF1s and I will definitely order from them again

These kicks are so fly know what I am saying I am like Nelly and keep two pairs just in case one gets too old

I have a Very picking boyfriend when it comes to shoes and I bought the wolf gray and white shoes for him and he loves them definitely will recommend he is already thinking on ways to stunt with them lol

I loved that it got here so fast My husband loved them

I bought these for my son who loves to wear them to school and just out and about The perfect casual shoe This is his second pair

Air Force ones are the favorite style of Nike both my sons wear Anytime I shop shoes for them I can never go wrong with these They were totally happy and surprised with the Christmas gifts I purchased three pair for each of my two sons They also love the trendy kind of funky colors

My husband has a few pairs of AF1 I heard him mention he wanted all black ones so I got them for Christmas They were on sale and with my member rewards and an extra 20 off at check out they were a STEAL He was super excited and said they feel good on He has wide feet so I got 1 2 a size bigger since they do not have wide sizes I would of rated them a five but they arrived 5 days after the promised delivery date But overall totally worth the buy

I buy these for my son every year for the past 5 years He loves the fit and style Always a good shopping experience

My son wanted this pair of NIke AF1 and so I got them for him for Christmas He likes the shoes a lot and wears them all the time He says they are very comfortable and he loves the style Fit perfectly

I ordered these for my teenage son per his request and he loves them

I bought these shoes for my husband for Christmas and he really liked them He didnt have any blue shoes and I thought these were nice looking and they were a nice price

 Allison

I purchased these for a friend he loves them and was shocked that they fit as well as they do especially since they were purchased online

Great shoe I would recommend this shoe I just love it

This is a great shoe I really like AF1I think it would be great if half sizes were offered over size 11 A Mensize 12 is WAY too narrow for me I have to go a size up for it to be comfortable on the sides Overall that is my only issue with this shoe

Finish line is where it goes down at you wanna get ur fresh clean on hollar at tha people at finish line in telling you they will put Tha groove 2ya

My son wanted those for the new school year he is 15 and takes a lot more interest into how he looks now He gave them a thumbs up so I guess I am doing the same Lol

Air Force are great like the shoes keep this sale I will buy more

Brought for my 17 year old who always liked this classic style sneaker it is a very handsome looking sneaker The black sail wolf grey combination are very classy looking The price was great also

My brother wanted a full black tennis shoe for school so decided to go with this pick He says it is really comfortable and fits him great to take at school everyday Was a great choice

Arrived on time great price very stylish can wear with anything very comfortable

My favorite shoes ever I have been wearing af1 for as long as I can remember always gotta have a crispy white pair on deck

THIS WAS A GOOD PAIR OF SNEAKER LOVE NIKE FOR MY GRAND CHILD

Purchased for my grandson He liked them Nice shoe

My husband wanted them shoes to match a jersey I got him He loves Nike shoes He has almost all the colors Thank you finish line for the good sales

The Nike company does not make shoes for people who have wide feet too bad I really liked the style

Comfortable stylish gotta have add to collection of 30

Sweet kicks Sweet price Thx Brads Deals Go Spurs Go

Ian so very pleased With this purchased it was perfect and the size was great the dilivery date was prompt and on time even early I am content with this item I will continue to shop for this brand Perfect

With just a touch of flair these can be worn in both a all day and then out to dinner without being judged Not flashy and not boring

PThey look good with everything

Been buying Air Forces for years Noticed on the newer ones Nike does include the deubr xc3 xa9 anymore They also use to include two pairs of laces now they just give you one pair of low quality nylon type lace Pretty disappointed

I bought these for my son and self as well Very comfortable and the colors are amazing Im very happy with my purchase

Although it has great reviews my husband did not like it This was a personal preference and not a product issue

This shoe is comfortable and stylish would recommend

Shipping was normal and the box a little beat but shoes oh the shoes are dope

My father in law loves these shoes I got him a pair last year and he wanted another pair Very good look on him

I bought these for my grand son and he loves them

PERIOD

Fast delivery

Bought these for my husband who loves Air Force ones He loves them and they are an addition to his collection Easy to keep clean and can be warn with anything

I bought these for my boyfriend He loves Air Force Ones

These shoes are very comfortable I like everything about them

I absolutely love the air force one shoe Unfortunately when I purchased these in a mensize 8 5 they were too big on the back of my foot So I had to return them and order them in a womensize

did not receive my points other than that everything was good

Great deal great material I recommend this site to be one stop shoe site meet me here on your next visit

No one else had the shoe you guys came through These were a must have Thanks

What can I say it is a great colorway

I have been getting Air Force 1s since high school back in 2010 a clean simple shoe that you can not go wrong with they do fit a tad big though in lows I noticed but I just changed the insoles and now they are perfect

I got these for my boyfriend he love them and true to size

Very nice style Set of the outfit just right Lots of compliments about the shoes

Awesomeee shoes I love them Size fits perfect and love the look of them

Love them It may take a little breaking in time but anticipate these will be very comfortable for a long time

Very comfortable can be worn daily I will definitely recommend this shoe

have had several pairs over the years of these and love them

I love the style of this shoe I have been wearing this shoe since the 80This pair is for my son it is the 3rd color he is had this School year We are definitely Air Force one guys

awesome 5 stars I love my air force 1 cant wait to purchase more shoes

AF 1 was the shoe that you had to have nobody was really thinking about Jordans do not get me I have Jordans too but nothing can compare to the AF1 you did not have to worry about getting shot over your AF1 If I could I would buy every style of this shoe

They charge me and did not have the she in stock waited two weeks for the shoes and another two weeks for my money back

David Smith

Shoe never gets dirty easy to clean the gum makes the shoe stay clean

Very nice comfortable shoe i want another pair in black but out of stock in my size UGH

Son who is now 17 will ONLY wear all white shoes low tops and Air Force 1 They are a good shoes for the price and they have lasted him a couple years per pair Quality is good A very classic shoe for a classic young man Also got the all black pair Buy 4 pairs twice a year at least

this is a great classic shoe it goes with anything and looks super cool

Awesome great buy worth every penny I will definitely buy again

These shoes are really cool I like how they fit because it does not wobble or slip It can be kinda heavy but it is a bulky shoe to start with so I was already expecting it

Shoes came dirty as if they were already worn Issue was corrected in store

I love ones and no matter how old they are I still wear them like they came out yesterday

Very good shoe comfortable and goes very well my Dallas Cowboys jersey Got the shoe sooner than expected as well so thanks Finish Line I was disappointed that they did not have my sons Nike hurache in stock after they said they did on line other than that everything was good

Believe it or not the initial intention was not for athletic use at all My son had a dance to go to and I did not want the basic hard bottoms that he would only get to wear once I told him about a look we put it together and it was GRAND cause MOMS RULE Dressy duds with some fresh whites Talk of the dance And mom got lots of hugs for that lol Great shoe Clean FLEXIBLE look

My favorite sneaker of all time Timeless looks and can never go wrong with the white on white With Nike ID and countless colorways these are as creative as it gets These sneakers represent a lifestyle and time period in which if basketball meant something to you these were the shoes to get They run 5 size big but other than that Personally must have a pair in my rotation at all times

Daily use pretty much the only shoe that I wear winter and all I still got about a yearworth of wear out of those shoes before they got bad enough that I did not want to wear them in public They are still pretty comfortable though I wear them to and from the office even though the tread is worn pretty bad just so that my dress shoes can stay clean Great comfort great quality a little pricey but they look great when they are new and feel great for a long time after

always get 1 half size smaller as these shoes tend to scrunch up at the toe if you get your true fit i love air forces

The service was great I got my shoes in only a couple of days The new Nike Air force 1 shoes offer the same top notch quality as the originals with a far greater variety of color option to choose from so you can find the pair that is for you The Air force 1 is a good mixture of classic Nike and modern style

The styling is timeless the fit and durability is always good and I highly recommend this shoe

can not go wrong with a fresh pair of 1Classic styling and always comfortable the price was right and I did not have to stand in line or win a stupid raffle to purchase

I have nothing to complain about the product everything went great I am very happy with the the sneakers

Only slight sign of wear so far on the toetop the action part of the shoe that is constantly bending as you walk So of course it is showing bends I only mention this because the rest of the shoe looks same as it did before wearing them all day 30 days ago and I can not see anything else to comment on they look fantastic A bit more money than I usually spend on sneakers but they may prove to be worth the money

love the colors of this shoe and it fits great waitied until it went on sell to buy it the nike products have become sooo expensive

Thank you

My airforce is really comfortable and fashionable None of my friends have it and now they want one Great buy

First pair of Air Force 1 Lows I have ever owned The colorway caught my eye Purchasing without trying on first was slightly uneasy to do But I managed to take a leap The fit is smooth with quality manufacturing throughout the shoe Little to no wear or creasing when worn minimally and stored properly Overall a shoe I would purchase again in different colorway

USA Air Force 1s Best Air Force 1 that has come out in a long time Comfortable unique Fit true to size Get them for AMERICA

I like the sneakers comfortable nice color reasonable price Finish Line has Nice Sneakers

I love the colors thats on the shoes The colors are unique and not to hard to find outfits to match the colors

Much heavier shoe that I normally wear but for his wedding groom wanted all white leather These fit the bill and a classic

love the color scheme on these shoes i know people will be wondering where i got them from

this shoes are so perfect to my feet the comfort that gives to my feet everytime i wear it thats why i recommend to all my friends

After wearing the shoe for a couple weeks it still held up and that is what i would like to see in every shoe Overall an okay shoe

Black and Vivid Blue Air Force 1are everything with blue jeans and a vivid blue polo shirt the vivid blue color POPS

I could have probably went a half size smaller I usually wear 12 5 13 and I got a 13 on this particular shoe Other than that I am very pleased

Great shoe especially in the summertime A classic silhouette that can go with anything and still have a high style factor

Air force ones have got to be the freshest gym shoe of all time They are absolute classic and the trend setter for nike and competitors

I just can not wait 2 rock them af1bcuz the colorway features my favorite team color the Washington Redskins these af1r so fresh and clean they go str8 with all my skins outfits LOVE them just perfect

I think the air force 1are a great casual shoe You can wear these shoes with anything and they are pretty comfortable When I purchased these shoes online however I did find out when I put on the shoes that they were about a half size big Other than this minor problem it is a great shoe overall

These clean classics must remain in production forever I rated the value at 3 stars because 90 they are pricey and the performance was rated at 4 stars because they will crease right away But overall I am a lifetime customer of these shoes and if you are looking for stylish clean white on white shoes there are none better Overall 5 stars

This shoe is my fourth pair of AF1 and this is the cheapest I initially got a wrong size pair and I had it exchanged easily and efficiently

Goes without saying the all white Nike Air Forces are a true classic best sneaker to wear with jeans period Very comfortable although they run a little large for Nikes Will be buying a new pair of these every year until they stop making them

Nice shoe The colors on it work with a variety of outfits

It is not very comfortable when I wear it I am thinking to return it

I got these for Christmas They look sic and are really comfortable The color is great Only drawback they run about a full size big Had to send back and wait for new pair to be shipped Thinking about getting another color

loved them

You can not have enough AF1you need them in all colors And a couple pairs of white on white so you are always Fresh

Could not WAIT to get mine and rocked them the same week with some jeans and a nice shirt I got the all white ones and I love them

great shoes I was looking for the navy suede option but this leather material is far better and looks great too

overall just a good shopping experience I have already recommended it to several of my friends

Great shoes very comfortable to walk in and great colorway great purchase

I love AF1and the fact that new colorways come out on a regular basis

I love the look of these shoes and how I can wear them with any casual outfit A little steep on price but definitely worth the look

Great shoe They are a timeless classic This new colorway is bananas One drawback they run a little small I suggest going up a half size

Classic shoe always comfortable

It does not get any better than Air Force 1 shoes Plenty of colorways to go with any outfit and always comfortable I must have shoe for all sneakerheads

This classic sneaker that can be designed so many different ways is presented to us in another great design I really like the clean look to this shoe

And of course the women love it

Found a good overall value in these sneakers but needed to purchase Dr Schollinstep supports due to sneaker being to flat

One of the best shoes ever made by NIKE Keep up the good work and continue to put out good product

this shoes are amazing they are stylish and very comfortable and true to size above all else the price is right you can not really get a nice pair of shoes these days without spending 150 or more

This shoe was the best shoe I have ever bought It captured my favorite colors to atThese Air Forces took my personality and formed a SOLE love them with all my heart

I have been buying these sneakers for years and was excited to see these back in rotation The patent leather white on white is always a head turner Overall I am satisfied with my order although you can see some minor damage and scuff to the toe area right out of the box

these shoes look even better in person nice colorway cant go wrong with ones

AF1s are great shoes The only thing I do not like about AF1s are the soles They are heavy and almost make you feel like you are dragging your feet Other than that these shoes are great for any occasion

i love af 1i own atleast 25 pairs all different colors

very clean and classic styling a little bit of effort to keep the white sole clean and it creases pretty easily other than that great shoe and worth the money

These are all around shoes from working out to wearing them at gatherings These shoes are made to last long also My last pair of air forces lasted me about 3 good years Make sure if you buy air forces to buy the force field so it keeps them looking new for a long time

Good Experience

Great looking shoes that are very comfortable and easy to clean

AF1are always a great shoe these colors matched with a lot of my Knicks attire

The sevice was wonderful also the shoes are very comfortable Will tell friends about shoes

The only down side about these shoes is that I usually am a 10 5 I ordered at 10 In all honesty I could have gone with a 9 5 Keep in mind I do have a very narrow foot and this is a wider shoe

At first I loved these Nikes The slight extra height of the heel and sole took the strain off my kneww and low back I was wearing them every day I thought finally a great pair of shoes Then they rubbed a very painful callus on my little toe From the ridge of the sewing and extra fabric on tongue I have trimmed the tongue area But until my little toe stops having pain I will not be able to see if that solved the problem So disappointed I now ordered Nikes with no top stitching on the top of the foot Will see if that helps

I bought a pair of Nike Air Force 1 07 Suede MenShoes in December and worn it casually for less than 10 times it is broken already See the photo for details The product is not durable at all

Those shoes are amazing They are narrow but comfortable I usually wear a size 10 but 9 5 in these fit just fine

Absolutely the MOST COMFORTABLE shoe athletic casual or dress I have ever worn I use these shoes for lifting and playingperformance level and style points are a 10 My next pair of shoes will be a different color of the Retro 10simply the very best shoe on the market I am in my 60s and workout 3 4 hours a day If you buy a different pair than these you are a fool

I totally recommend these shoes So comfortable and I absolutely love them

These shoes have only one redeeming quality and that it is that they look good When I first got the shoes they were very stiff with a lot of heel lift like others have noted and left my feet very sore for the first few weeks of play On top of that the horizontal spike pattern causes your right foot to slip out to the right in the downswing Rory was very frustrated by this problem as well The stiff composite material wears nicely and stays clean at first but after a certain point they start to yellow and that is it They are done The shoes were not very supportive around the ankle and I could not use these to walk for USGA qualifiers because of it I have been continually disappointed by my nike goods as of late and am very selective with purchases and recommendations because of the decreasing quality and performance

Fantastic comfort right out of the box no break in needed Have had a ton of Nike golf running and casual shoes These fit true to size IMO The only small gripe is that the inside of the heel occasionally bunches up a bit but honestly it does not cause discomfort The grip on the shoe is great have not had an issue with grip in any conditions and I have had mine for over a year Just bought a second pair

Very Expensive and the fit is horrible I wore them for 1 week and they were so uncomfortable that I needed to buy a new pair of a competitors shoes

I am returning

The AF1 will forever be a timeless silhouette

Love the styling of this shoe and the grip is just incredible This is not my first Nike golf shoe but this the only one where I get a little heel lift and its so annoying It is a comfortable shoe but it is the only one where my feet are a little sore after playing a round similar to what I feel from my snowboard boot after a day snowboarding I can not comment on the durability since I have only played 5 rounds with them so far They are stiff when you first get them but they do soften up with wear

Shoe was really stiff and did not allow for good weight transfer Not comfortable to golf in at all Maybe it would get better after use but I am not going to risk it Will be returning this product to the store

This is an amazing shoe After playing 2 rounds in rain and wet grass the AIT sole is the best gripping sole I have ever had on shoe both spike and spikeless And the Lunarlon cushioning on the shoe has so far been a big help for my lower back pain and feel amazing on the feet

I love these They look really cool and are also really comfortable I am a girl and I love sneakers but there are more options in Air Force 1s Jordan etc in men shoes I am usually a size 7 in nike so I got a size 6 and they fit really well Overall awesome shoes

These shoes are not the best shoes for Balling but they are useable they have decent grip Im a hypebeast and a baller at school so I think these are great for a cheap price They are heavy at first but you get used to the weight Honestly after using yeezys for a month I think these are just as comfortable as them

Great look Very comfortable Awesome grip Easy to clean

These shoes are very comfortable and they look great Also they clean up great after a round I have had these bad boys on with a bunch of grass and debris on them and when I take them off and hit them together to clean bottom everything comes off Going to buy another pair this week

This is my second pair I have bought this season different colors Comfortable and stylish shoe The new Thunder Blue which appears purple is color changing In tight light it appears purple blue or green Love these shoes

I bought these because I liked the zoom air technology and thought they would be a good pair to rotate with my lunar epic flynit twoI find when walking on these the air bag seems to go to one side so you feel like your walking lopsided I took these for a test run and finished a little slower than normal due to cushioning I would recommend for walking but not running in Causal wear would be good as well

I run twice a week usually about 3 4 miles each time These shoes are great for that kind of run I prefer the lunarlon technology to some of the air maxes The flynit is breathable Even great for walking

These shoes were some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned They had one flaw and that was the amount of support they gave your foot was very minimal One day I was out running and my foot caught on something and rolled I had fractured my 5th metatarsal because of them

Shoe was very comfortable but it did not last very long Right sole started leaking air which made them unusable Nike usually makes a great product but not this time

These shoes are very comfortable I was in the market for a new running shoe and these were recommended to me by a friend Very content with my purchase I just had my first run with them and did 4 miles and it felt great The one minor annoyance about this shoe is that if you are someone who likes to trail run the tiny pebbles will get stuck in the small creases on the sole I tried to pick them out with a toothpick after my run but realized that it does not effect the shoe in anyway and that it is not worth my time to try to remove them Just a bit annoying Other than that a really great shoe overall for the price I paid Would recommend

Compared to the LCV 1these are more comfortable The material is easier to clean and does not stain The placement of the swoosh is better than having on the toe box Simple modern traditional looking shoe Traction is great Only negative is the tongue wish it was higher up

I have never worn a shoe that was so tight around the ankle It is a struggle to get them on my feet and I definitely have slim ankles I should have sized up at least two full sizes After 30 minutes of jump rope I could not feel my toes

Easily the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn Great cushioning when running and such a pleasure to wear once you get out of some football boots Although the lacing system did not ensure a tight fit around the balls of my foot i barely noticed once i got into my stride

By far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Only downside is pebbles get caught in the bottoms of the shoes but does not even matter in the end I would highly recommend this product

it is a little bit too narrow if you have wide feet this may be a bit weird but it will do Overall very comfortable Durability is not as good as I hoped but they endured daily use

I purchased these because my Lunar Vapor 1 about killed my pinky toes with how hard the outside sole was making them not so durable at all I had worn them about six times and they just always felt tight and never wore in These Lunar Vapor 2have given me exactly what I wanted in fit durability and comfort I played my first round in them and immediately knew this was a different ball game Never felt uncomfortable and play exceptionally well because my feet could move without feeling any pain Not saying the shoes helped me shoot lower but they put me in a position for my game to be better because I was not thinking my toe was about to break off Very pricey golf shoe but well worth it now because I am comfortable the color looks great lime green grey and black and I am focused on hitting shots and not my feet Worth it in my eyes

I will start by saying the good partsthe flyknit is awesome its lightweight and they have a great selection of coloways

These shoes run really narrow Even after wearing them for a few weeks hoping they would stretch out they never did The shoe also does not feel that if offers any ankle support and rubs the back of the heel uncomfortable when using to walk By the end of 1 mile I could barely walk in them

Last years ran small this years are truer to size Some consistency would be GREAT These are also very wide IMO So roomy that they make a folding noise when walking in them Annoying but I guess I have to deal with it

Very comfortable feels a nice cushion on your feet especially heels backheeels One thing that Nike may improve here is their durability in rain or water They will start soaking water as soon as come in contact with it and will hold it which feels terrible on your feet Another suggestion would be to make front part a bit wider Even though the mesh keeps is cool I personally like some air flow or specifically some open space near my toes These shoes hug my entire foot which is OK except the lack of air space it leaves near toes My Brooks Adrenaline GTS do a fantastic job with keeping my toes cool

This is an amazing shoe Looks cool and feels very soft and comfy It is a bit narrow so you may want to order a half size bigger I am so happy I bought this shoe I bought this not for running I wear it as an everyday shoe and it is amazing Highly recommend it Looks really cool too

I have tried so many fitness shoes trying to accommodate my high instep and narrow foot These are a dream I wear a 9 5 in most shoes however I always size up for running shoes I got these in a 10 to give my socks room I wear these for cardio They hug my feet support my arch and are my most favorite Nikes yet I snagged them on sale too If you have a wide foot I imagine they might be more difficult to get on as the ankle opening is pretty snug

Very light responsive and comfortable spikes Fits true to size

I have been wearing lunar series since 2013 and this model is great as I expected These have great support on my heels and the sole I would definitely recommend this model and I am looking forward to upcoming lunar series

I have been running in Nike Frees for about 5 years now My calf has been giving me some grief lately and I noticed when I run on packed dirt it is less painful When I wore out my Nike Frees I was looking to get another pair But the reviews for the Nike Free RN 2017 are awful I knew these had more cushion so I went for them And I am glad I did My first run was great Faster than my normal pace and not a peep from my calf Very surprised a shoe could make that much of a difference

I bought my ZAO6 month ago and had air leak out Very comfortable shoe a little weird to get used to the air almost propelling you forward But the fact that they are useless without the air in one shoe makes them not worth the money for me

Amazing design Classic Cant go wrong Durable however creases very easily Slightly too wide and and size large would recommend a size or half a size below usual Apart from the easy to crease its a wonderful design and an amazing shoe

Durability is great Im at 500 miles and the shoes physically look great one wash and you would never tell they have the mileage on them granted my runs are done primarily on road At 500 miles their cushion is no longer good enough for running but still have plenty of life left for walks or trials They also encourage great foot roll and ground strike

Over all this is a great show the colors are bright and the shoe is well out together my only issue is that the style is different in adult sizes

This product is very comfortable The color was very nice as well

Bought this for my daughter great for any weather and super durable and its comfortable for her great job Nike

This shoe is Very comfortable The shoe has very good support Like the neutral color

Classic shoe no way to go wrong Nike also got the shoes shipped and delivered quickly 10 10

After trying different Nike models and some other brands I think I found the best fitted comfortable cushioned and lightest running shoes in the market I have ran over 40 miles with them and still feel like running in the clouds I will keep buying lunarepic low flyknit 2

Great to workout in or kick it at the games Also easy to order and gets shipped quickly

They breathe really well They are not the most comfortable pair of nike shoes i have bought but they are pretty darn close

Perfect shoe for casual exercise I would definitely buy another pair Great purchase

The GoodThese sneakers look great are comfortable right out of the box and provide awesome cushion

I really wanted to like this shoe it was however a huge disappointment The react cushioning is great soft but not squishy The fit however for me is terrible It is tight on the midfoot which I thought I could fix with alternative lacing It did loosen up that part of the shoe but after 50 miles these shoes hurt my toes let us just say I know I have run in them after a 6 mile run They also slipped on the heel I guess I will just have to use them as a causal shoe I will return to my Elite 9s and Pegasus 34s I am not sure why Nike is making shoes narrow Oh and I do not think sizing up would make a difference I would not recommend this shoe despite the great react cushioning Buy the Elite instead

I picked up a pair of these since Nike appears to have discontinued the Lunarglide series which I have been using for almost 10 years now on paper the React seemed similar in terms of the neutral midsole support stability cushioning etcbut it is a very different shoe

This shoe is so comfortable to ware I walk every where I go and need a good pair of shoe God know That these is very dependable

I recently had to return these just because of how tight they were I sized up since it was recommended in other reviews but it was still too tight I wore them a few times and they were fine length wise but the width was way too narrow I have wide feet but I figured they would at least break in but they did not sadly Very nice and comfortable shoe just not for anyone with wide feet I was told people with wide feet should go a half size up in the epic reacts since the flyknit material does stretch so I might do that

I was very impressed by all the hype around the React material Immediately you can feel the responsiveness from the shoe and how bouncy it feels with each step The heel to toe transition is great you can really feel the movement from it with each step Lots of great colorways to choose from Only two points to bring out the shoe runs small so go up half a size and I am not sure if it is the shoe or my right foot but underneath the shoe tongue something was making a certain spot on my foot very sore like it was being rubbed the wrong way I use these for running and gym They are great option to wear around as well

Just purchased yesterday and they are really nice and look great I recommed sizing of course to try on if possible bc not every foot ia the same I wear size 12 as in all other Nike shoes They are nice update to the Lunar line So far great shoes

The Short VersionThis shoe is a step back in just about every measurable way from the Lunarglide series If you are looking for a smooth pacing stability oriented shoe similar in stride mechanics to the long running Lunarglide series this shoe will be a serious disappointment u2028u2028

The Odyssey React has been the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn The upper is not flyknit but I for one am not a fan of flyknit I actually like a more stable not as malleable upper The upper is very breathable in my opinion It holds it shape and has not wrinkled or creased up The inner booty tongue is firm and compressing but not painful but enough to keep my foot secure while I run I have a wide foot so I went half a size up The React material is amazing Comfortable springy and does not give away The rubber padding on the out sole are great and provide great traction I did feel my foot get a bit warm but I did feel the breath ability in the toebox This is a narrow shoe so go half a size up That is all I needed I am a 10 5 true to size but bought an 11 and it perfect I have walked all day and ran in these and the comfort holds all day Amazing shoe

I picked these up to run with alternating between my pair of Pegasus 35 for easy days and longer runs I like the fit of these shoes feels just right for me I have low flat arch and the snug fit actually works for me Not as much room in the toe box as the Pegasus 35 but it does not feel constricting to me The neoprene tongue is awesome as well like the Pegasus 35 it is fixed and does not move around The support is not too pronounced but while running I can tell it is there I also like how there is no use fly wire it seems to dig into one of my metatarsal bones and cause irritation when I tighten up my other Nike models with the fly wire I can see myself using the Odyssey React more than my Pegasus because of this The React foam is nice and soft but not sponge like it definitely has a softer feel compared to the Zoom of the Pegasus which I like as well Sizing is true to my regular Well done Nike

I rarely have to size up to a 12 but did with this model and my poor toes are blistered to bits from the narrow sides of this upper I thought I would love this shoe It was soooo comfortable to walk around in but this upper can not handle the long distance runs if you are a forefoot runner or like to have any sort of toe splay at all Disappointing Back to the Nike Frees for me and really gutted to have thrown my money away on something I can not run in Not rolling in cash and can not afford too many more misses from Nike

After a lot of thought and research I bought these over the Epic React I ordered a 1 2 size up like many people had suggested and these shoes are AMAZING I am actually going to order another pair in a different color and a pair for my wife I have worn A LOT of running and training shoes in my life and these are hands down the BEST all around shoe most comfortable I have ever worn and I have bought Adidas boost great stability and durable can not say enough good things about this shoe

I already had some Epic Reacts and wanted to try the Odysseys to see the difference My wife ordered them for my birthday Run about 130 miles a month Switch between several pairs of shoes and use shoe trees in between uses My current favorites are the LunarEpic Flyknit 2followed closely by the Odyssey Reacts Third place is the Epic React then Lunar Apparent then Pegasus 34

Excellent shoe The inner support makes it for a tight fit so definitely go up a half size I recommend this over the zoom and lunarglide series

Overall this shoes fits and performs very well Both shoes have now developed a flopping noise coming from the heel area This also happened to my Epic Reacts and were replaced

Will definitely purchase a couple of pairs for the season

Fits like a glove 10 5 I only have 25 miles on these but so far 1 the midsole feels pretty soft I figure I have run on 35 40 pairs of shoes of all brands running 25 yrs and these are the softest shoe yet Maybe the midsole could be firmed up a little I am 145lbs and on level surfaces or uphills the cushioning is fine but running downhill on pavement the midsole seems to compress quite a bit Not sure how well this shoe would work well for heavier runners or runners who like firmer cushioning 2 The fit is superb with the inner sleeve perfect fit for my feet like they were molded for me could not get a better fit 3 They breathe pretty well but maybe not quite as well as shoes with a full mesh forefoot or the new Nike Pegasus 35 4 Overall these are pretty good shoes so far

Bought these shoes after reading other reviews how good these were The shoes looked nice when arrived When I wore these on my trip to new york I had rashes in my feet after 3 4 hours of roaming around Manhattan and the pain was unbearable If you have slightly wide feet do not buy these Though the length was perfect shoes are too narrow

This is a great looking triple black shoe and has a snug as designed fit Excellent for walking and the gym For running after 2 runs and 10 miles my back is killing me There just is not much of any flex in the midsole and the forefoot padding is hard and not adequate For a heal striker they may do ok at short distances They are an ounce lighter 9 6 oz size 12 menthan Brooks Launch but as a runner they just do not compare Like I said this is a great shoe I just do not feel it is much of a running shoe unfortunately

I bought this shoe knowing NIKE would not let me down on quality The shoe color is unique the shoe appearance and design is amazing the comfort ability is amazing It is a light shoe and does not tire your feet out I made a right choice and do not regret it Good stuff NIKE

Gosh I wanted so much to like these shoes They are light comfortable and great looking I am not a brand specific kind of guy and checked nike com Went for these I only run 3 or 4 miles 3 or 4 times a week I have a torn ACL from 15 years ago that I never had repaired and a herniated disc in my back that is manageable can not give up on life so I run with pain well jog in pain These shoes do not have as much fore foot padding as I would like I am a heel striker but push hard with the ball of my foot Since I started running with this shoe my back pain has gone past manageable I hate to return them but gonna try the Pegasus or Vomero

These shoes are extremely comfortable I have enjoyed running in them on paved and dirt trails so far Got them for the React foam cushioning but also really like the upper Also like the style Look forward to reviewing how durable they are after several months

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn they feel like running on a memory foam pillow with springs in it the neoprene tongue gives it a sock like feel and it looks amazing too overall a very well designed shoe

I love the look of these shoes online so I was very excited to buy them Unfortunately when I received them in the mail I was disappointed to find how narrow they were I wore them anyway thinking they might stretch or break in but they have not The size I purchased was already 1 2 size up which I do regularly to accommodate for my wide feet If you have wide feet I would suggest you stay away from this shoe

I am a long distance runner mainly on roads Average about 10 15 miles a day This is by far one of the best shoes minus the early stages of the Vomero to run outside with this is not a treadmill shoe The bottom burns away too quickly on a treadmill I tend to wear Pegasus on treadmills the React is way better than the 4 vapors I had trouble with the Vapor Flywhen I ran a marathon this past October the forefoot of the shoe became rock hard and had no give about 15 miles into the race i am impressed thus far by the Reacts and will make sure I stock up on these Thanks

I bought the Epicwhen they first came out and although I like them the upper does not work for me 100 too tight for my upper forefoot and the heel does not lock down without some adjustment to the lacing had to make new holes as they do not have the traditional holes farther back to help with heel lock I was hoping the Odyssey would work better since the tongue and heel are padded

First tired the epic reacts in person was not too impressed and did not fit true to size as it felt too narrow for me Did more researched and found out that these shoes size the same so I decided to purchase these instead and these have the color all black I need Very snugged fit at first But after the first hour at work Valet Bellman it began to break in and I could feel the true comfort and technology that the react is made for Would recommend to my fellow co workers hands down

The Epic Reactwere too tight around the ankle and top of the foot for me The Odyssey has a lot more give at the top of the shoe As far as cushioning goes there is no noticeable difference in my opinion

These shoes are very comfortable offer great support and are on point with what I have come expect from Nike I have high arches and really liked the style of the Epic Flyknit Reacts Unfortunately there was no give in the tongue of the epic reacts and they were very uncomfortable for me In comes the Odyssey which is perhaps Nikereaction for those that complained about the uppers on the reacts shoes and how tight on their feet they were The alternative stretch upper material on the tongue of these allows for greater flexibility and movement Safe to say I will be wearing these shoes a lot and the green with off white grey bottom looks so good

Great shoe Love the design on it Very comfortable and stylish

I absolutely love them great job guys

it is comfortable and a just a nice looking shoe the primeknit feels like a sock

Great look join the parley movement Turn heads with these

Feels like I am weaeing slippers haha The primeknit is soft on the inside and seems very durable Love how they are like socks instead of a regular shoe

It is really Comfortable to wear for everything such as running

SUPER COMFY and vey stylish These shoes can be worn for a long period of time with enjoyment being active or not These shoes matches with a everything and go very well with jeans and a dress shirt

This shoe fits like my favorite sock yet performs like the best all around shoe for many active situations

I love black boost so theese are legit wont get dirty so fast and i love the color its just a unique shoe to add to my collection of nmds especially since its a parley nmd the fit is good i didnt go up or down a size got my true size and it fits great but not everyone is the same some have to go down or up so no comment on size advice Deff one to keep in my rotation

I liked this product so I would be able to use these for exercising It passed my expectations

It is a very comfortable shoes and like the color and the style

I have been eyeing nmdfor a while and finally committed to purchasing one I am incredibly glad I did These shoes are great for working out and for casual walking

I wish all shoe manufacturers would use reclaimed plastic from Parley it is an ingenious idea one I had never heard of until Adidas App

Great shoes fit a little large and wide Quality but order half size down A bit difficult to change out laces if you would want to but possible

So the first time I wore these out in public I went to a pub and my server immediately took notice and asked me some questions about them

The NMD STLT is a super underrated shoe it is perfect for wide foot folks like me flexes at the optimal points so it does not create any weirdness in the upper when walking and slipping it on could not be easier because of the stretchy collar The Parley version adds just the right amount of color as well One thing to notethis version has a slightly different insole that Adidas uses on some special NMDs that makes it slightly more smooth and slippery inside not a dealbreaker by any means

Very lightweight and comfortable Definitely not a shoe for running more for style

Great shoes they fit well I really like the parley fabric woven in

it is a very comfortable shoe it is soft and fits well

TERRIBLE QUALITY sole came apart and fabric ripped within a week

Very good quality and comfortable shoes i would recomend to anyone

Good shoe over all my friend swears by boost try under armour hovr little more comfortable and better quality

I have worn several different brands of running shoes and once you wear Adidas pure boost or ultra boost you will not want to wear anything else The cushion is excellent You can wear all day and they feel like nothing else is comparable I can not say enough about the comfort I am totally satisfied with Adidas

it is certainly more on the firm side compared to an Ultraboost but still very comfortable Probably more stable as a result too I went with the triple black and it is GORGEOUS I always find myself looking down at them a lot The silhouette is near identical to the Yeezy 350 v1 if you are into that It has a burrito tongue and while some may not be crazy for it I looove it It makes it really easy to slip into and it just feels nice on your feet Very unique They are also very cool shoes They are always cold and refreshing when I put them on As for sizing it depends on whether or not you want an insole Just like an NMD it does not come with one If you are planning on wearing it as is go half a size down If you plan on adding an insole yourself your true size should work better I am a true size 10 I ordered 9 5 and it fits perfectly Though again part of me wishes I would gone for a 10 and stuck an insole in there it is entirely up to you I highly recommend this shoe

The shoes are light and comfortable Will buy boost again

Comfortable shoes should be made in USA for the price though You can see glue residue inbetween pieces Chinese quality what do you expect Love the shoe though

I love the feel of the shoe it is very comfortable

Shoe fit perfectly for me and the boost is a little firmer than ultra boost but still very comfortable I just do not know how I feel about the burrito tongue

I purchased these shoes specifically for retail work and spend 8 hours on my feet I always invest in a good runner to stay as comfortable as possible These shoes check all of the boxesgreat support comfortable and lightweight They do run a bit narrow in my opinion and in a perfect world I would exchange them for a wide but Ware sadly unavailable

These shoes are very comfortable I did not care to much for the tongue but it would not keep me from purchasing another pair

This shoes are amazing the confort lever is very high the boost sole is very comfortable feels almost like walking on a foam mattress I only wish it came with inserts but that is really a minor thing I got wide feet and this work perfectly

very comfortable shoe I really love the colored boost

Not a big fan of the folding tongue but happy with my purchase

These are great shoes for running or for walking around So great that I bought my Dad a pair and he loves them too

perfect fit sneaker with pure black color and boost sole overall an amazing shoe only downside is tongue which is little big and sometime it is tricky to get it fixed in place

The shoe has a great feel and I like the flexible upper part It makes for a great daily slip on

they are very stylish and they are one of the most comfortable if not the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought

I cannot say enough about pure boost Even over ultra boost shoes these seems to be the best go to lifestyle shoe They have lots of room for your foot Only wish they had continental rubber on the bottom

fits well Felt a little weird in the sole when I first put them on but after wearing feels good

it was for my dad he loves the fit and the cushion

One of the most comfortable shoes if not the most that I have ever worn They were a little big where your feet had room but not too big where they do not fit right

I have had these for almost a year These are some of the best running shoes I have owned They were not too expensive and fit my wide foot and high instep very well I find myself wearing them daily even in cold or rainy weather because of the comfort There are 2 items that could be improved the inclusion of an insole and an update of the tongue design To clarify the tongue is not uncomfortable but has occasionally been an inconvenience when putting the shoes on in a hurry There is simply too much material there and it can get in the way If the tongue is changed in the next revision this would definitely be a 5 star rating Do yourself a favor and get a pair

Came without insoles So I suspect that they were not really new and were a returned item

I just love these shoes Comfortable and stylish i can wear them with jeans or to go to gym with

It was a good looking shoe but had no insole which was uncomfortable

Light weight Great shoe for running Easy to maintain and wash

Is there a more comfortable stylish shoe anywhere

Love these shoes for either runs or long walks Love the all black design

The Pure boost is a great way to get the boost tech with a cheaper price I highly recommend for great comfort

I love the color combo of black boost and tan primeknit The pureboost line of shoes are all so comfortable I really like the lack of insole feet directly on boost

By far the most comfortable shoe I own I wish it was more clear that they do not come with insoles Almost returned them but after ready some reviews I tried some insoles from a pair of UBworked like a charm

Shoe was not comfortable compared to my other shoes with boost technology

Quality and extremely confortable while standing for long period of hours

I like the combination of colors It would be better if the shoes has no fold

Comfortable and stylish Robust and useful It fits well but the design of the show makes it a little bit uncomfortable to initially put on

Added these to my collection of Boost shoes that I wear for work On my feet all day and the cushioning and lightweight traits of the shoe is great

Really love the this pureboost for walking and working out Very comfortable fits true to size has a little more wiggle room as far as with than an NMD or Ultraboost but not at all loose either The only thing that I would say is a knock against it is the tongue it is folded over that is a little annoying to adjust until it is all laid flat But besides the tongue this shoe is great awesome price nice colorways definitely worth your time

The picture makes the shoe look as though it is all black but the actual stripes are more of a light silver which defeated the purpose of getting the shoes for someone who can only wear all black shoes to work

This is the perfect silhouette if you have a wide foot Similarly it is a cheaper alternative to Ultra Boost Highly recommend

Fantastic Shoes Comfortable sturdy responsive boost Highly recommended

the product looks great just be prepared to buy a sole for the shoe unless you are into uncomfortable shoes

This shoe is extremely comfortable I can wear it all day and my feet do not hurt

Bought these for running after my gray boosts They look better in person and fit better maybe because of the different shoe tongue My 4th purchase of adidas in 3months

I am unhappy with the product I want to return the item

Tongue design not so great Would have been better as a one piece bootie style upper

The primknit is breathable and light and the boost sole provider comfort and stability

Color and style This product has a really good quality

Great purchase and would definitely buy again

I like this shoe for how comfortable it is and the style of the shoe

First experience with boost and I am very impressed

Great shoes Bought them for work and they are just what I needed Wear them everyday

I am not a huge fan of flyknit or the like but this shoe is by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and consequently my favorite shoe that I own

Got these for my father instead of the Ultraboosts because I read these are slightly wider He was not able to fit in the Ultraboosts so we ordered these and they fit perfectly for a wider foot

This shoes recommend is Very comfortably and on feet like

Great looking comfortable shoes They just need different insoles

These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

One of the best adidas shoes if comes with a insoles will brings much more comfort

This pair of sneakers is the most comfortable shoe I have worn in a very long time The upper is very durable and breathable while the boost has a lot of give and is super comfy to wear all day long

do not think just buy

I like this product because of the way that the boost feels It is a very comfortable shoe and I recommend it to any boost lover

The sole inside uncomfortable weird sensation there are a holes inside

Great shoe to wear in general build quality is on point Worn to the gym for several runs and long walks Still love these with the comfort they provide with a great look I would buy these over any Yeezy anytime

These are actually a bit darker in the picture which i like more than in person The sneakers are great for people with wide foot going half size down might work better if not add an insole If you want these to fit more snug go a full size down

These are probably my favorite looking sneakers in my collection

Comfortable great fit walk all day and your feet does not feel fatigue Best Adidas I have owned I already bought 2 more in different colors

Great look feel

The best most Comfortable shoe I have ever worn And I would recommend it to everybody

Comfortable durable and good looking Best shoe I have ever wore

It responds really well to heel strikes in other shoes I would feel an uncomfortable pain after extensive training which I feel this shoe counters

Very light great quality and super comfortable

I love the style and how light the shoe is i had a pair of boost shoes but it is hard to keep them white so this solves everything great purchase

The quality Is super confortable for travel or run i love the ultra boost

does not make sense adidas shoos whit no shoe insole

No innersole made the shoe fit way too big

Super comfortable shoe really recommended shoe for long time standing

I like this product because I like the product with boost

The shoes arrived with no insoles and are slightly uncomfortable

Great shoe Fits well and looks fashionable My first adidas shoe and I was not disappointed

Shoe is nice and fits well but does not include insoles

I have found the Pureboost shoes to be very comfortable I have been able to go for long walks without foot fatigue or pain They feel even better as yo break them in This pair however felt even more comfortable than the 1st 2 pair I purchased

I love how the shoe feels but would have liked for it to come with the insoles

Very comfortable shoe that gives pleanty of room throughout My main complaints are with the tounge of the shoe and the area over the big toe While the tounge of the shoe is not uncomfortable it is slightly over designed It does not take anything away from the shoe but is a slight annoyance when putting the shoe on My next complaint is about the toe box of the shoe Adidas put a seam right over the big toe This creates a slightly noticable amount of pressure over the toe It is a slight annoyance but I am sure it will loosen over time Overall I would say these shoes are a solid buy on sale

This is probably the most comfortable running shoe ever made Thank you Adidas

Once I put these shoes on it felt so comfortable It does not squeeze my feet like other shoes Totally recommend these shoes 10 10

Great quality and comfort This shoe is everything I expected in regards to material quality and comfort The foldable shoe tongue is interesting do not really know it is purpose however not a nuisance

It looks good with any outfit and is a great gym shoe

Very comfortable but I had to put my own insole in it If it holds up I will definitely buy again

Gorgeous well made sneakers that are sturdy enough for the gym and stylish enough for an evening out

A wide tread with ample room for toes to flex and excellent low ground pressure No insole is genius easy to keep clean

Great purchase very comfortable and great looking

Prefer smooth inner sole and conventional tongue Prefer more stability

it is my second pair without insoles Wonder why do they come without

The one reason this shoe is not top ten is because occasionally the tongue bunches up and you have to readjust it

Black can go with everything and anything as well as the comfort is truly amazing

it is impossible to find comfortable shoe when you have wide feet I took a chase with the pure boosts Man I have to say it is the best chance I have ever taken in my life I have purchased many different styles of the pure boosts and I have been really satisfied with the results I have had with these shoes Comfortable spacious in the areas where other shoes fall short claiming to be wide My son was born with normal feet not wide and we both agree it is simply one of the most comfortable shoes we have ever owned

These shoes are really comfortable I recommend their use

did not come with an insole but love the look and how they feel when worn Comfortable for wear all day

The most comfortable shoe I own Definitely a good purchase

it is the most comfortable sneaker ever created Boost is the BEST

Fatal flaw there is a big seam in the top of the shoe that goes directly over your big toe That seam rubs on your toe just enough to cause irritattion If they had figured out how to move that seam to the side they would be great Returned them

The PureBoost are a pretty comfortable shoe for regular wear Not as comfortable as the UltraBoost but these also have the slip on upper with a folded tongue so they are pretty unique Overall a good quality shoe

They do what I need them to do and that is provide the perfect support for my feet

Good for walking and running They are pricey but comfortable

what is not to loveThey are comfy soft and so good looking I have no issues with the lack of insole but the tongue catches me out from time to time Still a great looking and great feeling shoe 10 5 fits spot on

Due to there is not some and slipperyhave to use my brooks inserts

Perfect fit amazing boost better than ultra boost and the boost is thicker than in the ultra boost shoes A much better more sleek design makes for a streamlined and a more one to one connection with the ground giving perfect and lockdown ans stability while still giving more energy return and more underfoot cushioning than the ultra boost shoes

These are like you are walking on clouds could wear them all day

The shoe is even nicer in person And it goes with several different styles

I love these shoes Unfortunately they run small so I ordered up a size and a half but guessed wrong I should have ordered up just one size I wish I could exchange them for a 1 2 size smaller but the shoe itself is incredibly comfortable

One of the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn Pureboost cushioning is second to none Plenty of room for wider feet Highly recommend

I like the all black look of this pureboost pair Hopefully it lasts longer that my previous pair of Boost soles Finally a pair that is wide enough for my foot though I was surprised the purefit sizing does not really support insole use I prefer adding extra insole support and there is not enough room in the front of these shoes for even the thinnest of insoles

do not like the tonque or width of the shoe does not seem as comfortable as others

I like the shoe it meet expectations but the toung of the is not as comfortable as my other boost sgoes

Love it soo much and I would recommended to friend

Boost technology is better than any other running shoe on the market

I used to be a sneakerhead in the early 2000and at some point grew up and realized it was a bad investment to spend all of my money on shoes That said I still love shoes and keep up with all of the hype

this generation Boost is too wide in general Need to offer more colors in the Ultra boost franchise like you offer in the Boost franchise

The midsole is firmer than other boost shoes I have had but the upper is very comfortable and I love how they feel overall

Great sneakers but they came with no insoles Also I could not find insoles on this site I normally do not write reviews but no insoles should be disclosed during the purchasing process

I like this choes it is amazing and very comfortable The design is very nice

I love Jordan products and I find different variety of this product and the shoe is well designed I mostly where them with socks and the comfort is unbelievable I will always shop at finish line for my shoes

I absolutely love these I had been wanting them for a while and I finally got a pair this past weekend They are so comfortable I wore them all day today at work and my feet are not killing me They look super cute So glad I got them I actually find them to be a bit more comfortable than my 270s not to say I do not love those too because I do but comfort wise these are better Oh and I had to get these in an 8 5 I am glad I tried them on first My 270s are a 9 but the 9 with these were a little too big I usually wear an 8

I have got two pairs of Huaraches and they are very comfy and stylish I usually wear an 8 in most shoes but for Nike Free RN and Roshe I size up to 8 5 However an 8 fits better for me in this style because of the stretchy back Definitely worth getting

awesome shoe true to size and very comfortable my first huarache shoes and will definitely buy more

I have broke my ankle three times and these are seriously my favorite shoes I just ordered another pair

I recommend you go a half size up because of the back heel thing it makes the shoes a bit smaller I wear an 8 5 and now Im considering getting a 9 A slight issue is with the laces not being able to be tied as tightly as I want because of the flywires They seem to move more when youre tightening them Otherwise very comfortable for long periods of time school work is not a problem in these Running is not an issue either quite comfortable but I was hoping for more of a lockdown and tighter fit Very comfortable and I recommend other than that

I highly recommend this product I own several pairs of huarachebut this style is probably the most comfortable out of all of them I do not use them for running I use them for fashion They are a great shoe and go good with any outfit you want to wear But the shoe is very comfortable and I am sure would be great for running too

1st time i thought it was not comfy but 2nd wear it was the best ever

Love Love Love Great sneaker so much compliments color is nice comfortable and light weight

I love huaraches I have several pairs in many colors These are my go to sneakers I prefer to use them casually I rarely wear these running or to the gym I bought these particular sneakers in white I say they are a little less durable because of the color but the sneaker over all is a wonderful fit Perfect Very snug so if you like a little more room Id say go a half size up I also have this type of shoe in the green color which I love more because of less room for messiness The material just hugs your foot perfectly Ive been meaning to grab a black pair for work Ill probably end up buying 2 black pairs one for work and one for leisure Im an RN Im on my feet for 12 13 hours at a time and these nursing shoes just kill the balls of my feet It never fails I can never find the perfect pair of shoes for work but I think I might have just done that I love that this sneaker is light weight yet supportive at the same time Thanks Nike Im beyond satisfied Im looking forward to purchasing my third pair in this design and wearing it to work I cant believe people prefer Nike frees over these shoes To each his own I guess

Super comfortable great for summer when you do not want to lace up a pair of shoes It like having the comfort of a sneaker in a slide I went all day in them and did not have any discomfort

Im a big fan of the huarache style These are the comfiest ones yet

Very comfortable and durable no complaints at all

I ordered these shoes because I liked the look of them When I ordered the 8 5 what I usually wear in nikes They were too small and smushed my toes at the top I then returned them and got a 9 which fits perfectly except the fact they are a little wide I would recommend ordering them a half size larger then what you usually wear Other then that they are really comfortable shoes to walk and run in

I just got them and they are very lightweight and true to size They are comfortable on my flat feet and they feel as comfy as bedroom shoes I got them on a good sale at the Nike outlet store The style is so flattering as well A definite must have

these shoes are beyond comfy I love them and get so many compliments on them Fits amazing and easy to clean My only complaint is I am able to visibly see glue

these shoes are awesome they fit perfectly but I would recommend getting a 1 2 size smaller everything else is great super comfortable great quality I would recommend these

I use these on my Disneyland trips I must say 12 hrs of walking all day I felt like I was walking on a cloud I am am true size 6 5 and I went for the 6 5 I wish I went with the 6 or 5 5 My feet are wide at the toe area so I was surprised that these were big I would recommend going down half a size or even a full size the back has an elastic with a lot of wiggle room in the back I highly recommend these

I bought size 7 5 but I am actually size 7 and it is still too narrow on my toes area After walking 5 hrs my foot starts to cr and cause it is squeezing my foot So bad design If you are gonna buy this shoe buy 1 size bigger than your normal size

These are my second pair of huaraches and man these shoes are so comfortable I had another pair of nikes that I would wear to work standing all day and they were not the most comfortable granite they were training shoes I got these wore them to work and they feel like cushions and are so light weight Will be getting another pair soon

I absolutely love these shoes Not only do they look great paired with working out gear but with casual clothes Ive gotten many compliments on them and they are super comfortable The only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is because within a couple of months of normal wear I do not use them to run or exercise I began to see a tear in the heel area I would be willing to buy another pair only if they were more durable

I never wear these shoes to run in and would not recommend them to run in as that is not their purpose I purely wear these shoes for street wear These shoes are super comfortable and flexible Everytime I wear them I get many compliments and would highly recommend these

I do not use this shoe for running I have actually never used it for training of any kind I wear this shoe as a casual lifestyle shoe It is mostly comfortable but after hours or walking it can make my foot feel slightly uncomfortable in the arch I get lots of compliments on this shoe no matter what I am wearing it with

Most comfortable Nike shoe Ive ever had Great for running Fells like running on clouds Shies look super cute too

I absolutely love my new shoes that I received ahead of the supposed shipping date

Comfortable shoe for long runs good casual look for sports events

I absolutely love these sneakers They are very comfortable yet very sporty I can wear them with almost anything and be comfortable These are my official favorite sneakers Trust me Buy them its worth every penny You will not be disappointed They run true to size and they fit to your foot because of the material Very similar to the roshe runbut BETTER

I have had my eyes on these shoes for quite awhile and I got them on here for a great deal They are very comfortable and roomy and they are not too narrow Definitely would recommend

These shoes are the best They are so comfortable and light weight I love them and will definitely order another color I do have a high arch and I ended up ordering a half size bigger and I wish I would have stuck to my regular size No need to get a bigger size they stretch to fit perfect to your foot

Buy Them They are super comfortable and cute the color is nicer than the picture they feel amazing and seriously recommend them

I have been wearing these for 2 weeks and love them I love the sock like aspect of these so easy to slip on Also super lightweight and breathable Would recommend

This shoe is great for causal or active lifestyle Very comfortable and light and stylish Perfect for warm weather outings

Nice very durable and comfortable would recommend product

This sneakers are absolutely great for the summer The color is bright and the shoes are very light for running and doing every day errands The color is bright and the shoes are very light for running and doing every day work I will continue to buy this sneaker and this brand

I love these shoes and the way they feel when I run Highly recommend these shoes

I am in love with this shoe just as much as all my other nike products I was definitely not disappointed

These shoes are by far one of the most comfortable shoes Ive owned I have the gray and now will be ordering the other colors as well

Love these its my 3rd pair Easily the most comfortable shoes in my collection easy to keep clean and I always get compliments on the blue pair such a fun color way

I cant get over of how comfortable they are Just bought a pair about to buy another

I love these shoes by far they are my favorite I also love this neon mango color I just put my shoes on and head out the door I would highly recommend

Had to return my 7 5 because it was half a size too small im usually a 7 or 7 5 but i think 8 wouldve been perfect My toes were not comfortable in the shoes but these were comfortable Another complaint are the insoles that keep slipping out not sure if my pair were too tight causing it to slip out everytime i take the shoes off Design looks awesome so might buy a pair if they make another generation hoping the sizing and insoles would be better

I noticed a lot of mixed reviews regarding the fit I am a true 7 and when mine came in the mail it left space in the toe area approximately 2 cm Otherwise this shoe is amazing

Great shoes Looks as good as they perform Hope more color ways come out soon

Very comfortable and stylish I wear them to run in and casually

very stylish very comfortable and easy to wear i love nike shoes so i have about 3 pairs right now but this one i wear the most true to fit

So comfy perfect for city life Ill be buying in different colors

These shoes fit perfectly I also ordered my true size

Super comfortable shoe completely not what I expected it is like walking on clouds honestly and I am on my feet all day for work so this shoe is definitely a1 choice

These are the most comfortable nikes ever but after just a couple wears the threading on the heel portion started to unravel and its progressively gotten worseafter only 2 months Great shoes but wish they held up

I love the huarrache ultra shoes so much that this is actually the second pair I bought I bought my first ones in Tokyo and wore it there Even with all the walking we did my feet did not hurt because they are so comfortable The only thing is that I have to buy a size bigger than my normal Im usually 6 5 and I had to get both shoes in size 7 5 womens

Super light weight and so comfortable Plus they look really cool

The shoe is in true size Neither too large nor too small Perfect fit to your feet Black color make it easy to match different clothes

Feel like Im walking on clouds no lie People say to go a size up but I got my true size which is a 6 and thy fit perfect Im not used to wearing bright colors on my feet but I had to make an exception for these orange ones

It was a gift for my gf she loves them She says most comfortable shoes she has eve had

Great quality shoe exceptional performance while running

I can not say enough good things about these shoes I usually refuse to pay more than 80 00 for NIkes I treated myself this time and do not regret it one bit These are super comfortable They look super clean I got the grey and they look good with everything I ordered my usual size 9 and I am glad I did They fit great Buy them I wish they had more colors

I love it color shape sexy looking good running if feel good

These Sneakers are very comfortable My very first pair and Im extremely satisfied EXTREMELY Thanks Nike you never let me down

I Love these shoes They are one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn I was a little hesitant in buying my size because of everyone saying go half size up so I did and Im glad I did I wear socks with mine so it makes the shoe fit better for me maybe some do not wear socks so it fits their true size All in all I recommend getting the shoe

By far the most comfortable shoes Ive ever owned am planning on buying other colors just to have them to wear everyday The only thing is that the insoles arent secured because everytime I take my foot out the shoe it comes out

I read a whole bunch of reviews saying to order your true size or order half a size up I ordered my true size and it fit but when I would walk my toe would push against the front and it got uncomfortable to walk in Ordering half a size up now hopefully it works out better

These are so comfortable feels like your walking on air best Nike Ive probably ever purchased I do suggested to buy your true size I ordered a half size up and Its too big

I have the grey blue and orange I usually wear a size 7 to 7 1 2 I first bought the grey ones in a size 7 in store and wore it while doing errands etc throughout the week I soon realized that the toe part could use a little more space because my toes were right on the edge even with wearing thin socks and my longest toe would get sore So I got the 7 5 instead and they fit perfectly Loved them so much I got the other two colors

These shoes are so comfortable and very stylish You can wear these in workout attire or with jeans and tee for a more stylish look I will even wear my leather jacket with them So obsessed thank you Nike

I bought these in the bright mango and it might be the best purchase I have ever made It exceeds all expectations for comfort and looks alike The minute I put these on I knew they would be my new favorite pair it is like walking on a cloud a supportive sweet looking cloud

I never thought that I would get huaraches When I walked into the store I only decided to try it on I fell in love with these the minute I walked around and told myself that I had to buy them They are so comfortable and light to walk in They run more true to size because the back Nike sign is elastic I definitely recommend this shoe

I ordered the mango color and I am in love with these Super duper comfy and light I can bounce in these all day Love them

I purchased these in black and white the day they launched I received them a lot earlier than Nike predicted and I could not be happier Ive already worn them and got compliments and stares the entire day Like all huaraches you have to size up I got a 7 as compared to my usual 6 These are also a lot easier to get on compared to the other huaraches styles The only thing I dislike and why I only gave 4 stars is the lack of structure in the front of the shoe This translates to they will definitely crease and it will crease on day one of wearusually this isnt an issue with huaraches But besides that one flaw I highly recommend I do not and will it run in them these are strictly for the purposes of fashion lol

I loved the OG huaraches for their comfort and style If youre looking for reliable comfort and easy fit the huarache 2 0 does just that

really nice pair of slides for the price looks great feels great goes great with my jordan 6 sport blue But like as jordan slides go one size down if you wear a 11 get a 10 Once again really glad Jordan Nike brought them out

The fit and support is amazing I like how they feel on my feet

Went a size smaller on these to avoid slip sliding around and it was a good idea Size 13 owners should purchase these in a size 12 Very durable compared to other Jordan slides of the past and equally as comfortable

comfortable and good looking would definitely recommend to friends and family

I give it 2 thumbs up I have had them for a week and used them everyday and never bothered my feet at all

They are the best slides for basketball

This is one good looking shoe Unfortunately it is very narrow Most people have narrow heels and are wider at the toes This show narrows at the toes I had to return my pair Sad

LOOK GOOD AND THE PRICE IS REALLY low got the shoes order 2 of them the upper material is ok the rubber platform doesnot look good rubber material was not to durable right size not to comfortable to wear will i recommend this shoes for young kids yes the price is right for long durability comfort no

could not pass it up Great deal comfortable shoe for every day activities or going to the gym stylish and great for casual wear Would recommend purchasing these and checking out other deals Finish Line has

Great looking and great fitting shoe I love them and will buy more colors

Nice style Lightweight Comfortable Fit like a glove I wear them all day at work and then for casual running afterward Shoes get wet causing socks to get wet as well Invested in water and stain repellent Problem solved Good shoe

Got the glow core black turbo colorway Love them On sale half off retail great deal considering the quality and comfort The prime knit upper is so comfy and soft super light and give good support Good alternative to an ultraboost for the price Not more comfortable than an ultraboost but for not having boost they are pretty close All that said they run super big had to go down a whole size Wear men 10 in ultraboost was a 9 in these I have a flat narrow to normal foot for reference

I got the email about this new deal and of course it was on sale so i got it The only thing i do wear 10 and it was a bit tight when putting in but once in best shoes ever for every single day

Very comfortable love the colour pattern and fits perfectly

These are simply the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn

this shoe is so well crafted and designed it literally fits like a glove does not get any better

Like the sneaker just needed a 10 Not a 10 5 No socks

Bought one pair accidentally Really enjoy these Have like 5 colors already Try these that are as comfortable as ultra boost mainly due to nice soft knit upper and wide outsole

good for casual wear not running a good price and

Great sneaker Nice color combo Will purchase another pair soon

I like it for the style and it is very outfit fluid

I own a couple pair of these Adidas EQT shoes because they are stylish and very comfortable The fit is very good Another brand of shoes tends to be too narrow but adidas are alway right for my feet

I like the looks price was right and it is comfortable

I do not recommend for that reason

The color and the comfort RUN DMC put me on Adidas and I have been all in shout out to the Kings

Great shoe you once can get your foot into the smallest hole

I love the all white look and also how sleak they look Also very comfortable

Its so comfortable i love it the color pretty cool

Comfy and true to size These are a must have Highly Recommend

They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

They look great are super comfortable and fit verg well

One of the best adidas I have had Very comfortable and looks good

I thought these would fit the same as ultraboost so i ordered an 11 really should have gone with 10 5 They are really comfortable even though the midsole is not boost The primeknit is a nice touch

Great looking and lightweight excellent arch support runs half to a full size larger than most normal fitting adidas

First day out I have already received compliments Just an overall quality shoe with a clean great look

The feel as you push off from the floor is unbeatable I took the laces off and rocked them with white socks and they look even doper

Great looking shoes and comfy too Runs maybe a half size big

My perfect shoe Due to an old ankle injury I have a significant overpronation issue and find it very difficult to find shoes that are comfortable These shoes provide excellent support and extremely comfortable The primeknit is amazing I love this shoe enough to have 4 pair in different color ways Thank you Adidas

I love the texture and the shape of this shoe

The shoe not only looks great it also feels great I lobe wearing these shoes

These are so sharp Comfortable and stylish Perfect fit very comfortable

The colors are vibrant and the shoe fits my feet perfectly

These shoes are definitely all i hoped them to be 100 comfort with the swanky adidas aesthetic Absolute perfection

Very comfortable shoes I have worn honestly I highly recommend this product

Love the primeknit on the EQT I have another EQT without PK and this shoe definitely feels more comfortable Delivery was quick

I love the look of this pair of shoesgreat colors and design They fit good but much more loose in the forefoot than the back and heel area as far as width I have not been able to run in them but walking around is comfortable

Shoes are not the most comfortable in the Adidas line but the styling is very good The heel is fine but could use more padding in the forefoot area

Great looking shoe and also very comfortable to wear

These shoes are form function and style I will be sporting these at Atlanta Hawks games and the afterparty

This shoe just screams different The colorway is a great pair with the shoe model

I will say though the sock collar for some reason is very uncomfortable at first but I have not seen anyone else have a problem with this maybe I have cankles maybe I got a defect where the material is too firm but definitely try it out once you get them and make sure you are ok with that feel

The Mid support or primary appeal of these particular shoes are neat but sadly for my father they were painful even to wear The Mid support would try to correct his foot and as a result for him they were not even wearable He actually chose to wear a worn down almost destroyed pair instead due to the level of discomfort they caused I am certain for some people it is a great shoes but for me and my family not so much

Its super comfortable and looks great with anything

They not only are a perfect fit but the most comfortable as well

Fits perfectly but needs resistance against raining days

These shoes are comfortable feels like I am not wearing shoes the prime knit is incredible

I love the shoes and they are really comfortable but the sock like hope to put them on is way too tight which makes putting them on a 10 minute long endeavor

Too tight to wear it My feet can not put on the shoes

The mesh uppers of these EQT running shoes are so very comfortable I really like the design and style of these shoes I am planning on purchasing another pair in another color The fit well and are very comfortable

Lightest and most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

I walk a lot in my university so this helps my feet from getting tired Comfortable while walking and i love how the shoe lets my feet breathe

This is a great looking shoe I get a lot of compliments

These are worth every penny They are form fitting but do not fit too tight As with the other EQT shoes I bought I buy half a size down from my regular size and they fit perfect

great brand of shoes Price was very affordable I like the color as well

I own several pairs of EQTThese are the cheapest MSRP and they are easily the most comfortable pair for regular daily use These are straight up as comfortable as NMDs and Ultraboosts in my opinion even without the Boost sole

This was a gift for my teen son He wanted something neutral They fit good very lightweight and fashionable Shipping was very fast maybe 3 days Easy process

Love these Great shoes and comfortable Great buy

Quality and everything just perfect I highly recommend it

Why does adidas make a RUNNING shoe 1 2 size too bigI really looked forward to making these my go to work out and running shoe To top the matter off the shoe sold out and I could not exchange for a smaller size Not a happy customer at all

So the shoe was comfortable Just a bit small for my size

I have a love for abstract and different colored shoes Purchasing this shoe was a no brainer for me

Stylish and great price shipping was fast and easy with great prices and stylish shoes I will purchase again lol keep sending the discounts

Perfect fit lite weight shoes like the prime upper

Cheap clean and fresh Feel great and have a nice fit

Love the look of the show but it was way too big

Shoe size runs large recommend ordering a size down

Great looking shoe They have an annoying stretch piece that you have to get your foot through before your foot is in the shoe I could only get my right foot in the shoe My left foot would nt fit through it Not sure why they have this I really was hoping they fit

These shoes are so comfortable they feel like I am just wearing socks

Yoooooo you all need to buy these If you want people to look at your feet constantly and if you want consistent compliments you should definitely get you a pair of these

I rarely buy shoes online but with the return policy I had to give it a shot and Im glad I did The shoes are super comfy I usually find Adidas a bit small but these are perfect right out of the box Ill certainly look to buy another pair soon enough

Still think the Ultra Boosts are the most comfortable at the moment although these are comfortable and have a nice design Might want to go 1 2 size up if you do not want a snug fit but you can get your normal size and wear it without tying the laces

Very comfortable light weight shoe I like the knit fit makes the shoe very breathable I could have gone down half a size to 9 5 and it would still have been a good fit

Textiles and rubber insoles seem kind of basic not sure it will wear well

Yes Nice style and very comfortable the price is very affordable for me

Wanted to love these shoes I got super excited when they got here taking off my shoes as I opened the box and once I pulled them out DAMAGED Ripped and unglued where the lace goes At first I was like its ok maybe I can super glue it on or something but the more I thought about it the more upset I got cause why should I do the job of a multi million dollar companyI gave them my money to do their jobSo yeah super upset with Adidas and do not get me started with the pain in the neck return system

it is a really nice shoe just hard to put on The color scheme is nice with the white and neon back

They are so comfortable and looks so nice that I love them

The design is not my style And the shoes is very different from the website show

I bought these just for work because I wanted to work comfortable They really feel great

Very Comfortable shoes superb impressive just perfect Would recommend this

Very comfortable shoe and fits very nicely I suggest wearing a little higher socks as the top can get a little tight and rubs

This shoes is so hard to put on The opening is small Had to pull hard to wear it

I purchased a half size up The toe might be tight for some I purchased these to go with my pete tracksuit that is maroon orange and white I usually wear my orange alphabounce sneakers with this The EQT support mid sneakers in white go great with this I made the sneakers pop with orange red laces yes I have a drawer full of laces The Eqthave great support for your arch and are really comfortable The insoles are removable to wash but you can put in an orthotic Did I mention they look really good and I got a great deal

They are so comfortable it slips on like a sock and a perfect option for people with wide feet or any type With primeknit it conforms to your foot for maximum comfort

They came when expected and fit perfectly They were true to size Fit like a glove also great without socks

Had to send my 1st pair back and go down half a size I love the design and feel of these if you are looking for comfort you will not be disappointed

The shoes are generally worn the heels are uncomfortable the workmanship is not fine and it is a bit unsightly The three letters on the shoes are hidden giving the impression that they are like shoes

I really love these shoes although I would recommend ordering a size up

I definitely recommend these Might be hard to keep clean but I will take my chances

could not ask for a better pair to add to my collection

I really love these shoes They look amazing and feel even better The white sock portion comes up so it does not even matter what color socks you wear if they are no show socks I have very small ankles so this does not bother me My friend has bigger ankles and says they are a little tight on the ankles But I absolutely love them

Really wanted these shoes because they looked great or so I thought The shoe is fine but the design is horrible the mesh fabric that the top and sides have feels like a sock You can see your toes through the shoe when you walk Tried talking myself into keeping them just could not do it had to return

Very comfortable and good for walking and running Not good for the rain

While it is a great shoe and all it is too big and even when I ordered the right size for my boyfriend after checking all of his shoes these still came in half a size to a size too large Adidas needs to specify on their products that sizes are enlarged

it is made well I prefer then over my nmd r1The upper mesh feels solid but I would not recommend doing anything too active in them I got a half size up but it fits true size

So so so comfortable Without a doubt the most comfortable sneakers I own Adidas not political just a great shoe

If you have wide feet good luck even getting your foot inside of these things The shoes are great quality but I could not even get my full foot inside of the narrow opening

I love that I have not seen anybody else with them on I hate looking like the next person I can wear them to work for 8 hours without my feet hurting afterwards

These sneaks bring a lot of style mixed with comfort I have gotten many compliments and questions about where I got them Definite show stoppers

Fixed very well and you feet and light weight shoes

Just to be on safe side take 0 5 size than usual

Really like these shoes they are insanely comfortable and look cool I got lots of compliments

The shoes we good and comfortable on my feet The price I paid was nice too

These shoes are out of my comfort zone on style but I have gotten a lot of compliments and they are awesome

Foot have too much play inside the shoes need to buy a size or half size down to make it fit good

Like the color and the way it feels when I am walking

This is a great pair of shoes for whatever you want to do They look great and are so comfortable They are definitely on of the best pairs of shoes that I have ever owned My only complaint is that they do come a little late both lengthwise and width wise but the width could just be because my narrow feet 9 10 would definitely reccomend

They are very comfortable and have a great silk look to them

Excellent shoes very comfortable Need to wear it more often to evaluate quality

I love the shoes because of their comfort and style but the shoes are a bit annoying around the middle of the foot

it hurt to wear these shoes without long socks on because the back tag scratches against the back of my leg Otherwise very solid shoe

Shoes were nice online Turned out to be nicer when I received them Ordered at size and they fit perfectly fine Definitely Recommend

The style and comfort are on point yet the shoe is a tad loose and too big in the toe Size is bigger than normal 14s

The shoes run large Order three times online but not satisfied with the fit

Beautiful design one cannot miss the three strips from any distance

These shoes fit like gloves leave a large footprint ensuring my security as I walk about They are made of this primeknit material that feels like I am wearing socks all day long The foot bed is what I enjoy the most I feel like I am walking on marshmallows and I am on my feet all day I own three pairs right now as I write this

do not buy these the midsole is a nightmare feels like hitting a brick

Smooth on foot Sits well all through out the foot Very comfortable style kind of shoe did not like how the back sits out too much makes the sneaker look weird but different in a good sense Rate 8 10

Shoe simply feels good on the foot is stable and we will cushioned even without boost Upper fits the foot well as most primeknit does Cushioning is good enough to wear all day without an issue Quality seems very good but of course only time will tell Great shoe would recommend

Shoes not only look good but one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn

First Primeknit sneaker i have ever had and i am wondering what took sneaker companies so long Amazing

Bought a pair and in under a month the tread on the bottom began to fall off Returned and got a replacement pair and the same thing happened in under a week would not recommend until this issue is fixed

Ive had these shoes for about two weeks Overall really comfortable but the tread the star shaped is coming off

So I have been eyeing these shoes for awhile and I went into the store and purchased them They are very comfortable The look with the black and gold is great it is got the patented black leather around the front of the shoe and it makes the shoe just pop If you are thinking about buying these shoes go for it they are a great shoe for a great price

In general i am happy with that

the desean Jackson under armour hovr are very comfortable and true to size and a great running shoe no insoles needed

I have 3 pairs of UA HOVR Phantom SE shoes because they offer excellent overall comfort fit and athletic performance These shoes are great for everyday use and also for working out at the gym and for running Just a note about the fitI wear size 11 in almost every over Under Armour shoes infinite sonic 2s etc but the Phantom SE definitely are more snug than other UA shoes Order a 1 2 size up for a more comfortable everyday fit and order your normal shoe size for a more snug fit I also have normal to low foot arches and I can put these shoes on without much issue but I have heard from others that people with high arches find these shoes very difficult to put on Overall I love these shoes and like them better than the other HOVR UA shoes that have been released in the last couple of years

Not only is this shoe good looking but it is so comfortable I wore this to work where I spend 40 hours a week on my feet and walking about 5 miles a day My feet and legs feel terrific

Most comfortable shoes ever I just bought a second pair in a diffrent color

These are an awesome pair of shoes Love how you connect to your phone and go Great Fits well I usually wear a 14 and order 14 Perfect

This is an amazing running shoe not as much comfort as others but amazing light So easy to just take off Very sleek very stylish not really knit on top just a regular cloth but this sneaker is amazing it is very snug Order a size up I am a 12 5 13 Ordered the 14 after an hour of fighting with these things they finally slide on and we are ready to go A little annoying to get on but the performance and comfort is definitely there

Should be standard issue for all Army recruits Best shoes I have ever owned Fits like a glove Order one size larger for easy slip on

Best sneaker I have put on my feet in years I would recommend everyone try these and trust me you will love them

This shoe is good looking feels great and great to walk in

Highly recommend even as an every day shoe

A really unique shoe design very light comfortable good support for running My only complaint is I did not realize this is more of a slip on with laces as opposed to a traditional shoe with a movable tongue While this design makes for a cleaner less bulky fit it also makes for a tight fit and I have a high instep so the shoe starts to cut off circulation after awhile but for just a run they are fine

I bought these to use for training for a marathon They are pretty comfortable and have a good stable base They fit right when you put them on and lace them up but after a few miles they stretch out and become loose around your foot which becomes uncomfortable and annoying to run in I do not like having to stop and tighten the laces These are a great recreational running shoe but because of the becoming loose after a few miles I would not recommend these as a long distance running shoe unless you like to stop and tighten the laces after you have gotten into a good running rhythm It took about 5 weeks of training at over 30 miles a week for that to become an issue so again not a long distance long lasting shoe I can still wear them for non running purposes and they are comfortable throughout but I wanted them as a running shoe 6 weeks worth of training is not long enough for a shoe to become retired

These gym shoes have great comfort They also have a sleek look about them

I bought these in the jet grey and yellow color after seeing my menbasketball players receive them Extremely comfortable but they do run small I went a half size up it is a snug compacted fit which is what I was looking for in a workout sneaker If the mango color comes back in my size I will probably end up getting those as well

Right out of the box this shoe was comfortable to run in Order at least half size bigger One of the best shoes I have ever worked out in

I really love my shoes they are comfortable they look very stylish I wear them to work on 12 hour shifts and walk as much as possible and my feet are still feeling great afterwards I get multiple compliments about my shoes daily which has prompted my co workers all males to purchase a pair themselves I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone who not only has a job that requires being on your feet all day but enjoys a great walking running shoe with maximum comfort and support These shoes wete intended to be just for my workouts but I love them so much I wear them to work daily

I was very excited to get these shoes to run in Once i got them they were extremely small compared to my size Then after having them for a month the seams on the soles began to break SO i paid a premium for shoes that break after a month of training With races coming up i cant afford to wait for a new pair I do not recommend these shoes

I read a review that said buy a full size larger than what you normally wear And thought I would write a review to back so its not the only review saying that

First I followed the other reviewers advice I got a half size bigger than normal Upon arrival I did not know there was shoes in the box These baby are CRAZY light weight They are absolutely beautiful too The phantoms do fit snug around the ankle with that extra sock part on the top Adds a nice little support They are not hard to get on but you definitely can not just slide your foot in with out a little coaxing from your hands I have yet to take them out on the pavement but I have put about 20 miles on the treadmil The first run was only a couple miles felt great Second run I wore non running socks and I ran for about 4 5 miles and it rubbed a spot on my foot Do attribute that to the breaking in of the shoes or to the non running socksWho knows But I can tell you I havnt wore running socks again just regular ol socks and they have been an absolute privilege to run in Comfortable cushiony yet responsive my knees do not feel the impact they normally do and seem to be breathable Overall a very great purchase and I am totally satisfied I hope these shoes carry me through my first half this October

I just bought these a week ago and I love them They are light and the HOVR tech is insane it is as if I am running or walking on pillows and I love them I usually get the SC30 shoes from UA but when these came out I knew I had to get a pair They are really nice and they are certainly worth the price They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

I thought these shoes ran small until I tried 1 2 size up My normal UA shoe size definitely fit best I think this shoe is supposed to have a locked in compression fit that people just are not used to They are definitely hard to put on because the opening does not give like the first Phantom but once on they are super comfortable and I have not experienced any of the chafing issues I had with the original Note I wear thin no show socks If you wear a cushioned crew sock go up 1 2 size The black and orange looks awesome and makes an impression I received a complement the first time I wore them and a stranger at the gym asked me about them a week after only wearing them once while I waited for the 1 2 size up to arrive in the mail

This sneaker is feather light and syncs easily with the apps from UA to give you great data I am not joe marathoner or anything but so far the sneaker is sweet Just hope it holds up and the tread lasts as its a little thin on the bottom

Good looking reasonable price and UA MapMyRun my favorite running and walking shoes till now

The tongue on these are fixed so it is very difficult to get your foot inside and they fit tight I purchased a 1 2 size larger after reading comments and they were to small I recommend to go 1 full size larger

The shoe is overall a great model looks sleek feels really good on foot However The new construction of the bootie is very very hard to get your foot into and I even went up a half size Once you have scratched your finger trying to shove your heel into the shoe it feels really good I get a perfect one to one fit even without the laces tightened there is a nice heel pillow in there that cushions your Achilles area and also helps with the snug fit in a good way this time

These shoes are great in every aspect Traction is top notch Even on dusty courts the traction performs amazingly The cushioning is very comfortable It took a few games for it to break in so initially the shoe feels hard and clunky but once the EVA around the HOVR breaks in it is great The fit is amazing The shoe is true to size and you will have to dial in the laces but once you get it the lock down is great for low top I highly recommend these to anyone Especially on sale

I bought these shoes in hopes they would fit like a sock and have tons of cushion in the bottom I also am a huge fan of making sure that no matter what court I play on it had a squeaky clean stop for traction this shoe checks every box it is been a while since I have been so happy with a shoe and it is frame and comfort get better wear after wear The HOVR molds to your feet and your movements The sock feel on the top is easy to slip on but once you tie the shoes you are locked in Love them

Well the Havoc Low PE is a very nice shoe It looks great and fits great I really have not spent much time in them on the streets or the parkbut around the house their working for me

Wear them as a daily and they are very comfortable Will probably buy another pair

Has great fit and support for pick up games at the gym

i can walk all day in this shoe primeknit gives just the right amount of support and yet not restrictive

This shoe is perfect Size runs perfect extremely comfortable with the Boost midsole and a very flexible yet durable Primeknit upper I love this shoe and can not wait to get my hands on another pair

I absolutely love this shoe This was my first NMD purchase back in August 2018 but I was sad to see these start to go I really loved how I could match this NMD solar pink colorway with just about anything and the shoe is alnost like a sock I think Adidas should make more colorways for this

Sleek and comfortable love the colors and the fit on foot

The Primeknit molds to the size of your foot and is also super comfortable The shoe is also really comfortable with the Boost midsole and the quality is very good but could be a tad bit better

Although they fit perfect and are very comfortable they do look a little wide and sometimes feel a bit chunky but overall I really enjoy the shoe and I am happy that I bought them as my first Adidas shoe

I think the STLT really is an awesome standard GR NMD because it is supremely comfortable and does not have any unnecessary add on plastic bits like the R1 lace holes The PK is perfect and stretchy flexes really well with the foot More color ways please

These shoes are so comfortable that I have bought 2 pairs The NMD line has the best looking shoes and the most comfortable shoes Adidas is ALWAYS my choice of attire

I slip these on all the time Multi colored is great very fun Great walk around shoes

The shoes provide a good style while providing comfort with the boost

They are comfortable lightweight and stealthy I really recommend them Can someone please explain to me what STLT stands for

These are some of the most comfortable light weight breathable and style shoes I have ever owned

I would say the pros outweigh the cons and overall this shoe is a work of art The comfort level is like i have never seen before It also looks good

NMD R1 never fails at its comfort and are always stylish with what you wear can match them with most of everything I wore these for a long period of time and my feet and knees did not feel a thing felt like walking on spongy cushioning the whole time

Prefect with with flexible material Insoles can get uncomfortable if being worn casually throughout the day but if just wearing for a few hours are perfect

These nmd are extremely comfortable and great looking The prime knit and boost are very soft Great shoes to purchase

This shoe is comfortable the back heel was initially bothersome but once the shoes were broken in they were comfortable and easy to wear

Absolutely love this shoe Its like wearing an invisible sock all day

Great shoes that look great on your feet Made of goos materials and work well in the color because even when they get a little dirty because of materials they still look great

It feels so nice on the feet and it feels like you are just wearing a comfy sock I have another primeknit shoe but this one is much better fitting

Toe comes undone from the fabric eventually but these got good use Took out the laces and still fit nicely Bought them again

The show has hot pink that is looks different from the pictures It is very comfy and amazing quality

Love the prime nit They fit really nice and are super comfortable

This was my first pair of NMDs I own several pairs of Ultraboost First off the NMDs lack the arch support Ultraboost have and feel less cushioned in the toe box I have added an insole to help with the arch support The insole insert also helps with the weird fit of these shoes The Primeknit without the insert seems to flatten out and collapse on foot My feet are a little bit narrow Not sure what it is but the fit in these shoes is a bit off I will be sticking to Ultraboost from now on Lesson learned

These do not have insoles and if they did they would be so much more comfortable The color also has a lot of pink woven in that is not shown accurately in the picture It is legit full on pink Not the biggest fan of that

My son Loves these shoes He thinks this is one of the most comfortable shoes he has owned

I bought those but the sole looks kind of weird on the inside looks like a hole and feels a little unconfortable

The shoe itself was a little too long However it is very comfortable and I got it for a good price

Very stylish and comfy Great quality I always love adidas NMD

Its a comfortable shoes and of nice quality Too bad I have to return it cause my husband does not like the color of the neon

the shoe quality is amazing but the primeknit around the ankle is loosing up

Light weight and this dual color looked alive With 50 discount worth it

Absolutely love these shoes fit perfectly super comfy can wear then all day without feeling my feet tired They are amazing

Perfect fit and super comfortable They are a really cool look

A great shoe that looks great and is very comfortable

best pair of products out there highly recommend for comfort

Love love love all this shoe So comfy and will definitely be getting more

Its super comfortable Also good for light training

I would not recommend Not comfortable attractive or fit well

Lightweight and just slips on not sure if I would run in these I do train in gym with them

It goes great with most pants and very easy to style with

I LOVE how comfortable ther are and they look really cool as well I have gotten many compliments

Love nod but this Color is not same as in the pic

I like the product because it fits perfect so comfortable and go a good sale on the shoe and was always a NMD fan

ConsLacing system creates an odd shape when looking down at them on feet not a good look do not go true to size 1 2 size up make this 100x more comfortable

Boost makes things very comfortable The primeknit upper makes it easy to slip on while still being snug to the foot

Bought these for my son he loves them and wears them all the time

The NMD in my opinion is the most comfortable shoe out there

Great product at a great price fast shipping

My daughter absolutely loved the light comfortable fit

These are some amazing shoes I have only put them on a few times but the feel really stable and comfortable I can definitely see myself getting something similar to this soon

These shoes look good and feel great to walk around in

Love the feel very comfortable shoe HOWEVAH Stephan A Smith voice I made the mistake of not taking too good a look before purchasing them The no tongue look is a bit off putting kind of weird But the main thing I completely missed like an idiot was the color scheme I thought it was gray and black throughout not noticing the solar pink Woulda been a lot cooler if it was but comfy nonetheless

These are my first pair of NMDS I ordered them have a size up because that is how I like my shoes and they do fit quite well When I first tried them on I thought they were so comfy Quite frankly I was shocked I have never owned a shoe this comfy My only complaint is the actual pattern on the shoe From the pictures the pure black and pink blended together quite nicely but in reality it creates kind of a harsh line and I do not really like it I have used them a couple times and I am used to it it is not that bad anymore

Color on the shoes is different than on the picture

I usually need wide sizes so I was hesitant to get these but they fit and feel amazing it is only been a few days so I can not speak for durability but they are lightweight and feel almost like I am wearing nothing at all it is like wearing a sock but with a sole

Hurt my feet Not so comfortable shoes Why I can not write simple Why review need to be longer Weird

These shoes were great but they just did not look like the pictures on the website They were far more pink than they appeared in the pictures I ended up returning them because they were too pink for me

Great shoe but execution was off due to no insoles and no tracking info

Although the shoes are a little tight they are very stretchy and flexible They look great with shorts and pants and are very comfy

Awesome color way and super comfy Definitely love all the nmd

Great quality material The shoe is very comfortable My only complaint is that the back of the shoe rubs against my Achilles causing some slight chafing

The strap on the back of the shoe ended up rubbing my skin raw and giving me blisters I had to purchase material to sew over it just to make these wearable

Love these sneakers great for spring summer fall sneakers Lightweight and comfortable Knit material is a great fit and adds even more comfort

These sneakers are light and comfortable The upper is more comfortable than that of the standard non knit nmd sneakers in my opinion and the sock like ankle gives an added touch I will not be wearing these in the winter months but they will be perfect for spring and summer

Awesome

Very comfortable and very good looking would wear it everyday

Comfortable and stylish shoes my 22 year son picked out He loves this style and color

Adidas comfortable shoe nice color scheme and would buy them all

The picture shown on the page makes the shoes look like they are woven with red fabric with the red fabric being hardly noticeable could not be further from the truth The shoes have hot pink fabric woven into the shoes that are extremely noticeable Of course it was my fault for not checking exactly what color the description said But if I order shoes I expect them to look like their photo

I am going to start with that I got these on sale I got them for 56 so that is my mindset when reviewing them I have so far found them to be pretty comfy even with the laces tightened to accommodate the sizing error When I first put them on I found them to be looser than expected leading them to run about a half size big The coloring is incredible and definitely something unique so if you tend to run with grey or navy blue shoes in your fleet these will spice up your color scheme The Boost sole is of course a highlight looking incredible on the outside and feeling even better on the inside Overall I would recommend these shoes if you are looking at them just get a half size down

Good shoe but the insole is horrible the octagon cutouts in the insole are uncomfortable on my heels I should have sent them back

The shoe was absolutely amazing but the one and actually the only problem was that the shoe did not have good traction So when I was playing a game in gym at my school I was sliding all over the place Other than that it is an amazing shoe

I love this shoe for everything Whether it be going out to do errands or just doing things around the house or even working in them Awesome comfortable shoe that is also very stylish and goes well with Christmas themed if

These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly Thank you Adidas for killing the shoe game once again

Some of the most comfortable shoes I own The boost soles give the comfort to walk for miles and the shoes are so lightweight they just feel like socks

The shoes seemed to run a half size too small Had to sell them to a co worker Super bummed because I wasted my only 20 off coupon

Imagine glueing a sock to a rubber sole that is what these are like

Love the colorway and it is definitely super clean However maybe the NMD model can utilize a more comfortable insole

Fit is just a tiny bit smaller at the toe than I prefer but there is still room It took a day to get used to break in these shoes especially at the heel support but after that day they are some of the most comfortable shoes I own

Great comfortable shoe fits well and color is perfect Arrived fast like them a lot

Great shoes and so comfortable I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned aside from the heel cuff The primeknit is super soft the Ultraboost sole is great but the heel cuff right where it meets the heel tab will give you blisters if you are not careful Should be padded with something softer there

My son loves the comfort I did had to exchange them for a smaller size The exchange process was hassle free

Perfect fit but would recommend going a half size down

Good price really comfortable and my husband love them

disappointed in the color spent a lot of money on these but was deceived by the color

they are stylish and popular I do not know why because they are uncomfortable

I got this product thinking it was all black but when I received the shoes it had a hot pink fabric woven in the shoe it is my fault for not reading the description but it would still be nice if there was a better picture posted for the shoe

I also love the color way of this shoe mostly black with a pop of pink

I do not like it because they were not would correctly Sole was glued wrong

I love this product because of the comfort quality and style

As a sneaker phanatic these are one of the most comfortable and stylish sneaker I have ever worn I feel like I am walking on a cloud Since they were half off I just may have to get another pair I highly recommend this sneaker to everyone

Love these Shoes I will be buying more nmd

Awesome shoes Perfect fit highly recommended Now I am just writing to make the review long

Just what my son wanted Good quality and comfort

Super comfortable and light Great quality as always

These are the most comfortable running shoes I now own

The shoes look very nice but what you cannot are is that when the shoes come they look orange Overall comforatble

I bought the wrong size and the store ran out of my size so I was forced to return them but they were stylish and I regret having to return them

They are comfy and perfect fitting for my wide feet

it is perfect and fits well The quality is perfect and width is good

I gave this to my mom for her birthday She absolutely loved it She wore it on her birthday party

I ordered these for my husband He was skeptical at first because they fit like a sock and he thought they may not hold up but they are not only comfortable but a sturdy shoe He wears them every day

I like them because they are comfortable I am more than likely going to buy more in the future

I bought it for my husband and the first time he used it he got bruise on the tip of his ankle

I love these shoes so far They ran a half size big for me so I went down half a size I think it is due to the primeknit material They are very light These are my second favorite shoes behind my Yeezy Boost 350

I wanted to like these but the prime knit upper sits really loose around the heel and mid foot and does not provide anything even remotely close to support The result is that your foot is swimming in a saggy sack of a shoe upper although the fabric is cool Also since it is an integrated upper and there is no tongue you can not compensate by tying them a little tighter Had to return them

Love the material on top Super comfortable to use and great design

Very comfortable Durable and stylish I have four pairs

I love this product because the colorway is perfect and it is super comfortable I sometimes forgot I have a shoe on

Good looking And great colors with comfort for the gym or just hanging

NMD uncared are extremely comfortable for all day wear

I love it because of the sound of the shoes and they are comphy

NMDs i mean what can i see about themThey rooooooock

I love these shoes Not super easy to put on but once on they hold tight They feel like I am wearing slippers but in a really great way

These shoes are comfortable and really stylish but the knit affords for holes to form in the front and side areas with not much stress These are worn as casual shoes around the house and running errands no sports they are essential garbage and we have not owned them for a week

very comfortable shoe good size to normal fit would recommend

These shoes are super light and are really comfortable Having said that I was a little disappointed with the boost technology as the one in the EQTs is far superior As other people mentioned I went a half size down and they fit perfectly The shoes were a little more pink than I thought they would be but I decided to keep these pair of shoes as the comfort was unparalleled

I wish I knew this shoe was so wide before purchased

The shoe was also wide compared to other shoes in this line

These shoes are one of my all time favorite pairs to wear They are very comfortable and stylish I get compliments every where I go with them on Order 1 2 size smaller because shoe does run big

I really like the feel of these and they are really light weight I use them at either the gym or just to wear out with an outfit No matter how you wear them they work Really comfortable shoes

it is good design with good quality very confortable

I love this shoe so much my very first nmd I have always heard about the boost in these shoes and they were right will buy more

Comfortable and light like great socks with a rubber sole that feel like your not wearing shoes at all

My feet are a little narrow but these shoes were super wide

No insoles come with this product My other pair of NMDhave insoles as well as a pair of UltraBoosts I own The lack of insoles make these shoes not nearly as comfortable as my other Adidas shoes

Was disappointed with the insole there is no cushion whatsoever It looks like the forgot the insole also my son has wore them a week and the sole is already starting to show wear The black piece is already pulling away from the white sole Kid likes them mom is not impressed

Bought these for my teenager and he loves them He tends to be a wider foot and these are a nice fit Quick and easy to pull on Not quite as much support as the Boost but a nice style change

I do not regreatthis purchase at all but several flaws I noticed were that the edge between the PK and boost is uneven slightly The more important thing is that if the quality seems not to match the price point This may all be in my head but the shoe does not SEEM durable I HAVE SEEN NO SIGNS OF VISIBLE WEAR overall very pleased with the purchase

Comfortable stylish and good pricing I really like shoes and will be purchasing again

its comfortable and stylish You can wear this color with most outfits

I was shocked that there was no insert in the shoe to cushion my feet but surprising the sole is enough cushion to have a large amount of comfort

very comfortable and the size runs just as normal

I like the style and color it is almost perfect the only thing that I can recommmend to add a more sole cushion it will be perfect

Picked these up on clearance and pretty happy with them Read the other reviews so the pink color does not bother me

Great for casual wear Feels like a slipper I wear them to the gym change to my trainers and slip them back on when I leave

Perfect casual shoes to lounge run quick errands sitting long periods of time airplane travel Not recommended for long periods of walking

I bought this for my husband and he likes it because it is so comfy and perfect for everyday use

I like because it is confy and the ship in was fast

Look and fit and comfortable goes with every style

I like shoes very much but the ankle of the shoes is too high to make me feel uncomfortable The color of the shoes is not so pretty

This is a really clean shoe I can wear them with joggers or jeans Comfort is Key

I purchased these for my 15 year son and he loves them He says they are very very comfortable

This shoe was a little less comfortable than I expected compared to the other Boost shoe I wore EQT

It just felt too loose I ordered it in my size but my feet felt like they were swimming in a comfortable pool What I mean is that during my running or rowing at the gym the shoe felt like my heel would pop out The design of this shoe is identical to the Ultraboost knit fabric but with that shoe I did not experience this behavior That is the Ultraboost felt more snug on my feet Barring this experience I should note that this shoe is extremely comfortable and quite nice to walk in likely because of the boost sole Ultimately I returned it and would invest in something a bit more snug

Great shoe but to improve comfort a padded insert is needed

A stylish shoe that offers a lot of comfort would not run or workout in these but they could get through it Shoe was a little narrow for my wide foot but still fit

The shoes is kind of in pink

Shoes fit good nice snug fit I own various different nmd ultraboost and yeezys and after a very short amount of time they stop being as comfortable as they were Just wish they would all last longer for the price we spend on them

The look and comfort of the nmd never fail For years I swore by a competitor brand but I think I have finally made the switch the 3 stripes mainly due to the comfort and look of the NMD line

the shoes are definitely easy to slip on and off of the feet

Nice design and the comfort is always as expected with boost soles

The shoes are very comfortable and breathablecan wear them all day with comfort

I really wanted to like this shoe The sock like feel the light weight the color I just could not get over the heel cup digging into my right ankle

Bought them for my son at the San Marcos TX outlet and found out that they were missing insoles disappointing

I like it because it is comfortable and it is the perfect shoe for everything

The comfort of these shoes are amazing Fit perfect

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned it is important since I am on my feet 90 of my workday I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for comfort and style in a shoe

I LOVED the shoes but they were too wide for me I had to return them due to the width but I wished I could have kept them They were so comfortable and stylish

wonderful shoe with great price Strongly recommend

I like this product because of its comfort and its look

Gave this as a gift and they loved the item they want more

Good product super light very comfortable for walking or running

Great shoe to run in however the back of shoe rubs the back of your ankle

Most comfortable shoe in the market I will be buying more

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They have completely converted me over from my flyknits

This is a great product Extremely comfortable durable and good looking The colors are great and work with many outfits I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested

I recently started buying NMDI know the stlt is not the most popular NMD but it fits my foot perfectly and it is easy to throw on and it is a very good looking shoe that is comfortable

Love the black pink combo and the knit upper is comfy and keeps my foot in

They are light weight and have a super comfortable fit

Love them it is like walking around in your favourite pair of slippers

I took these to my trip to Japan and it was the best idea I had besides just deciding to go to Japan The culture will some times require you to remove shoes in quite a few places so beinable to slip a comfortable shoe on and off was brilliant Then add on airport security and all the walking I did in perfect comfortable It literally was the perfect shoe for my trip And of course once I got back they are still ultra comfortable and convenient to take on and off A super not picky thing I would say if there was a draw back is they lack a bit of support going down steep slopes But having to go down a slope will probably not happen to you very often so super small detail

comfort and design ahead of it is time Only wish the mid sole was easy to clean

Nice for long flights or drives The knit is snug enough to stay on but easy to kick off without untying Ultraboost soles are comfortable for long walks but too soft for lifting weights military press squats or deadlifts Fine for running but would not be my go to Otherwise an excellent shoe to knock around in

A fashionable kicks for casual and comfort activities

The shoe looked wonderful but the back tag was absolutely horrible and rubbed into my ankle making it bleed I can not recommend this shoe solely because the tag at the back

Lightweight comfortable sole true to other NMD R1 versions that I own As others may have mentioned Adidas description of the color of this shoe is not quite accurate Oreo toebox with peach primeknit accents is how I would describe it Picture is pretty true to the shoe if you use the zoom feature

Very comfortable and fits like a sock Runs small so go down half a size if not full from what you wear in ultraboost

They are my favorite pair of shoes Thank you so much

The shoes are very comfortable but the shoe quality is very bad because they ripped apart after 1 week of using them and seem to not be well made

Feels like many other NMD which is a good thing and fit1 2 size smaller The knit pattern grew on me more in person Comfortable like most other primeknit NMDs Highly recommend

Great product I would recommend it to others I really enjoy the flyknit and the comfort of the sole

It is pretty but after order and wear it does not like we want it is not comfortable

Hooah wearing these at AIT army training

This shoe is very lightweight and super comfortable It feels like walking on clouds

I like this product but I was not expecting it to come in these more noticeable pink primknit It did not look exactly like the photo on the website

The shoe okay Almost as comfortable as an ultraboost But the picture was a little bit misleading compared to when you actually get it I did not expect to have so many pink in it compared to the picture online



Bought these for my son and my husband ended up getting a pair because of the comfort and look

can not beat what Adidas is doing with the boost Mixing style comfort

Ordered a half size down from true to size and it fit perfectly Most comfortable shoe I have owned in a while

I love the way these slip on and feel Great for running

Comfortable shoe I love it and price was right if you have chance buy them

I like it I am glad i decided to purchase Will i get other colors No I do love the shoe tho

These really are like putting on socks My only complaint is when wearing with low cut socks the back rubs against my Achilles and irritates my skin

Right shoe for everyday use in summer Not for sports

They are durable and well made will be getting more pairs

Maybe should have gone down half a size my heel kinda lifts up and down when walking which hurts my heel after a couple hours Might try to go down half a size for the next pair of would prime knit

My go to sneakers bought 3 pair 2 colors

Looks great feels awesome really adds energy to my night walks The only negative is that they run a bit small so order up

I was sad to see a hole in my shoes from the first day of wearing them These shoes one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet and I will say that the quality of the shoe allow forward to unravel at the toe

I just love the quality that adidas brings into the market

I wore them for about 30 mins and already felt the tag scuffing the back of my ankle I am pretty sure if I wore them any longer they would make me bleed Soles are not very supportive either

Love the comfort and style ability of these sneakers Like walking on clouds

I ignored those saying that these run large and ordered my true size I have a slightly wider than normal foot and they fit perfectly The Primeknit is incredibly light weight and breathes well I love that they slip on like socks and the Boost midsole is unbeatable I ordered the Black Gray Gray colorway and did not realize that they have a bit of a pinkish color in the weave as well I like the actual coloring much better than the online pictures

I like the style of the shoe I just wish that the shoe was a lil wider other than that it is a good casual shoe

perfect for casual wear and for the runners out there

This shoe is perfect for those who are on their feet a lot at work

PK is really high quality and stretchy I really like the fit and the STLT knit patters is legit

Shoe arrived in perfect condition and looked awesome I would describe the feel of the shoe as sock like which made it very comfortable The shoe does lack support for horizontal movement so be mindful of that

Great shoe slightly snug at the heel but comfortable

Unfortunately these are very noticeably pink rather than gray Will be returning since they were for my son

they are alright but I was told from friends and persuaded into thinking that they were supper comfy and stuff for running but they really are not However they are the only pair of shoes that fit the width of my foot while running so while running on inclines I get a lot more traction Also while on that topic they are the best at getting traction to the road or sidewalk that I have had so far If they would not give me blisters these would me my favorite shoes

I love how nmd are literally good for everything

Only complaint is that they do not have any insole and I think it makes the shoes less comfortable

Description on the website was incorrect colors did not match at all

Would not recommend you use this for running or anything physically intensive However for normal walking on flat surfaces they work perfectly The primeknit makes them so light and breathable that it will feel like you are wearing socks with a sole This may either be a good or bad thing based on how you look at it If you are looking for your feet to feel secure and protected this may not be the shoe for you However if you are looking for a shoe to be very light breathable and comfortable and do not care about your feet feeling protected then this will work for you So in conclusion these are only good for a casual amount of walking on flat street surfaces and can feel limited in terms of use cases

I like this product is well designed good material nice colors is unique shoes

Too big Need to return Sick of adidas sneakers being one size in one product and another in another shoe

The show fits nice no doubt about that the side of the shoe looks incredible but when you look down they look like your feet are huge and fat do not know how else to discribe it

Run slightly above size Adidas needs more half sizes Beautiful sneaker

First nmds I have ever purchased and I am in love with them

The primeknit material makes this shoe so great It wraps perfectly around your foot and weighs literally nothing

Good comfy kicks for the price Will be buying more soon

Great Lightweight Shoes They have the awesome support sole of NMD and the primeknit material breathes really well They do run a bit larger so I would suggest getting 1 2 size smaller than what you normally wear

These are comfortable and fit nicely and I would like to give these a higher rating but the advertising on the color style is very misleading The description of the shoes I purchased is core black grey grey and the images online seem to show that However the shoes that I received are basically orange Upon very close inspection of the photos online I can see the orange woven into the fabric now but there is no way anyone could see that without zooming all the way in The fact that description claims it is black and grey is also very misleading I am pretty annoyed because I usually do not wear anything with colors and now I have a pair of shoes that is obviously orange

Great slip on shoe great color A little big but not bad

Great product I recommend 100 percent Their also very affordable

it is light weight but comfortable Great price Great for walking

Great shoe but the back tag rubs the ankle too much

I love it but Adidas needs to widen the shoes The sole is so narrow that my foot is not supported well There could be wider options

Nice comfortable shoes but came with a defect with a small puncture at the tongue area so probably will return it

super comfortable feels like I am not wearing a shoe

I liked everything about this shoe except for the black pieces of rubber on the sides of the shoe After wearing the shoes around the house for just a minute or so I could feel the black piece of rubber on the outside of the shoe digging into the inside of my heel I am not sure how more people have not experienced this and I guess there have not been enough complaints to get rid of these pieces of rubber I feel like I have a pretty normal walk my other shoes have always worn pretty evenly I would like these shoes if they did not have this piece of rubber

Great shoes and great experience with Adidas Will do business again

Nice looks but it ends there Returned the shoes immediately because1 No arch support come on Adidas why leave out arch support2 very loose fit but smaller size would not be long enough 3 prominent orange thread even though description says gray black and white Feels like a cheaply made shoe

Is the best quality in the market and I like the style I used for more than 40 year

Shoes look okay but they actually look different like in the pictures

Confort and perfect fit for that price it is awesome

It says core black gray but why is it so pinkI also do not get why the color change just cuts on top

They are very comfortable and look good on foot They are very good for running

comfortable and good looking 10 10 would wear again

I knew when I ordered these awesome shoes that I would have to go half a size smaller 9 to 8 5 and it fits perfectly Very satisfied

I absolutely adore these shoes They provide excellent support for my full 12hour work day and the prime knit top does not get stuffy or tight The only downfall I realized is my fat self has already creased the support block near the outer front of the shoe Everything else is a solid 10 10

These shoes are great We have other pairs Very comfortable and easy for my son to slip on But the description needs to be updated The shoes are listed as black and gray which is why we ordered them We needed a neutral color to match his nicer outfits since we already have some other crazy colors But when we received them they were pink So we had to return them The color is the only reason I downgraded from 5 to 4 stars

I really enjoy this style of NMD a lot This is my fourth pair of STLT I will keep buying this style if my color styles come out The prime knot feels really good and makes the shoe so much easier to put on I highly recommend buying these shoes

The shoes are very confortable they look modern but classic at the same time Incredible design

They are great shoes they are very comfy and look good too

Extremely comfortable and stylish I do not how easy they get dirty but love the product

I wear these a lot and although I often feel like a frat boy in them boy are they comfortable

when i got these i thought there was too mush hype but know i realize they are great shoes

This shoe is by far the most comfortable shoe I own and it looks very clean

If you do not own a pair you should get one too NMDgot you covered

Love this shoe Very comfortable I like the colorway Only issue is if you have a slimmer foot like me you will not be able to run too comfortablely but I assume you can just insert a sole in there for more fitted feel if you just want to use these as casual and walking shoes they will be more than good I have two pairs and regret nothing For running I bought the ultraboost but these are more comfortable for everyday use

I loved the shoe it was the wrong size The size I exchanged them for fit perfect Jammy at the outlet was very helpful

Light Comfortable excellent fit I can wear this everyday

The boost midsole is slightly canceled out by the nmd plugs on the side but it is still very comfortable and the primknit upper is very breathable

My son picked these out and as soon as he put them on his feet he would not take them off

Have several pair of ultra boosts The prime knits have gotten a lot of compliments Great shoe

Its so comfortable and it feels like you are wearing socks it is perfect

Great shoe super comfortable snd light Match pretty much everything

Excellent shoes Great quality and the price was excellent too

When you first put them on they are wonderful After a few hours of standing or walking my feet begin to hurt Maybe I will try some different insoles However people all ask what kind of shoes are they and compliment me on them

it is stylish and comfortable all in one Looking forward to the next pair

Is confortable and good on foot cheaper good product

I love the look with the comfort of this pair of shoes

Love it because it is comfortable I will buy for my whole family it is cute shoes Love them

Bought them thinking I could do physical exercise but it is more of a comfort everyday walking shoe Other than that I absolutely love them and wear them every single day The boost is utterly beautiful and the ease from heel to toe is great Thank you for being beautiful Adidas

Simply put we all know what NMDs are how much hyped or not and whether we plan on getting a pair or more I love the color style and the price was the deciding factor I cop and rock what I like and I snatched these up Of course I like them that is why I got them Good Stuff Three Stripes

They are great they mold to your feet like socks forget about blisters or any kind of discomfort

I highly recommend Very comfortable show for daily use or going to the gym

of PINK Seems like that would be an important detail to mention Also runs about a half size big

Great look and extremely comfortable Definitely recommend

Bought for my husband according to him it is very lightweight and very comfortable to wear

I have not owned a pair of Adidas since 2008 because all the pairs I have ever bought have been too narrow for my wide foot these NMDs have changed my perspective of Adidas I swear I can not wait to buy another pair and another and another These are truly amazing Sorry it took me a decade to try you guys out again I am happy with my purchase Best Buy of 2018

Shoes run like a size or a size and a half too large Consider ordering a size or size and a half down Prime knit is wrinkled when you tie laces too

I love it Super comfortable Awesome in shorts and pants

Great shoes Super comfortable and stylish I would definitely be in the market for another pair

The slime green pops and gives such a dope accent to the shoe Im host people slept on this lol Solo swag boom

I love the product I have not found any cons yet They are extremely comfortable and fashionable The color I purchased is beautiful The solar pink is a nice addition I would recommend these shoes to everybody The only thing that took getting used to was the plastic area on the back near the Achilles But once I got used to it I loved them

I liked the price drop plus that was my first pair

NMDs are known for its comfort along with how light the shoes is That said would recommend this product line to anybody who is seeking for comfortable sneakers while being stylish at the same time

its extremely comfortable and stylish I only picked up one pair during the sale i regret not picking up more

Great fittin shoe slightly narrow by the toes but very comfortable

I liked them because of the price and comfort but I wish they did not have the neon green threads

Nice shoes 1 2 size to small Could be more comfortable

Cuz its green and lime green and its Soooooooooooooooooooooooo pretty

The shoe scratched my ankle to the point of bleeding I taped my ankles to prevent that from happening because I liked the look of the shoe itself But the tape kept coming and my heels would bleed again Ultimately had to return them

Love the style and look Simplicity is key and it was met with this product The only thing is that they sole is VERY uncomfortablemy feet hurt badly when I drive with these on

Love anything with boost These shoes look good and the primeknit is pure quality

The combo of boost and primeknit makes for an extremely comfortable shoe Main complaints are that it runs a half size big and that this specific colorway is a bit more pink than the pictures show

I love this product because of the fabric very nice

Regularly size 11 but 11 was too big and back hurts

I recommend to my friend as well

When I got the shoe and put it on and started walking around I noticed that the heel plastic digs into your feet and causes marks on your leg This became very uncomfortable to walk around and I had to return the shoe because of this I am not sure if this shoe just has that issue if all NMD R1 primeknits have this issue but I would recommend sticking to an either an R1 mesh or R2 primeknit as that does not have any issue on my feet

It is a nice shoe but at the end of it there is all of that boost material where you do not put pressure and that seems like a waste

I like the product because of the comfort and the style of the shoe

Very comfortable Slightly tight around my toes I have wide feet so I think I would order half a size up next time

Very nice design with easy to slip in and out It helps with busy individuals on the move

Color is not true as shown in pictures it is more pink

Perfect fit stays comfortable and soft troughout the whole day

Beautiful shoes nice to hang out not for running or going to the gym Hurts a little on the back of the foot heel because the shoe has a high back Anyway i would recommend it

I knew the STLT primeknits would be flimsy but I did not expect them to give me just as much support as my socks do I ordered the size I get all my sneakers in but the pair was still way too big for me Returned them and got Ultraboosts instead

Stylish and semi comfortable need to be worn in but eventually a very good fit

This product is very comfortable and has a good arch for my foot

I like the shoes I just do not like how the back rubs up agains my Achilles I can not wear the shoes for very long because the backing really starts to hurt if there is a way to fix that please get back to me But other than that I can not complain about them really comfy and really supportive

My son says these are the most comfortable shoe ever

I love the nmd platform this shoe is super comfortable

Very comfortable and they fit super nicely The primekit make the shoe more moveable

They are what I thought they had be Except they are a bit annoying if you wear ankle socks

Way more pink in person I had to return them Good shoe thought

Attractive colors and very comfortable

I got this pair as a gift and when I first saw them I thought these would be my favorite shoes Sadly I was wrong The Primeknit was not as stretchy or as cool as the Primeknit on my XR1 model This was warm with little stretch The heel area constantly rubbed against my heel which caused massive discomfort The shoe itself was also very narrow and I am a wide footer Overall the shoes look nice the build is nice but the fit and feel is not good

The shoe size fits perfect This is a mans shoes so if you are a girl order 1 5 sizes down I normally wear an 8 5 so I ordered the 7 and it is perfect It also feels like your walking on clouds The only thing that is bad is that if you wear ankle socks it might give you a blister This could be from my socks though I just put band aids on and I am good to go I would definitely recommended these shoes for traveling in or just for wearing around I do not work out in these shoes

This product is the best purchase I have ever made It is one of the most comfortable shoes ever made too I recommend going a half size down though

I went true to size with these like i did with my uncaged ultraboost and pureboost which was a mistake I reccomend going a half size down which is really confusing I wish the sizing for Adidas shoes was consistent The blocks on the side of the shoe kinda dig in to your foot making the shoe a bit uncomfortable Also the boost material is a lot less comfortable that that on the pureboost and ultraboost despite being the same price The heel area of the shoe also feels a bit stiff which adds some discomfort as well Aesthetically speaking the shoes are great but I thought Adidas did not compromise comfort for looks

Ive loved the Nmds from adidas for 2yrs now my first pair was the Nmd r2 pk and it was ok but it wasnt great my new pair looks like a million dollars but there are a few glue stains which really made me displeased but besides that i still really really like them

Best purchase ever I paid the good price Very satisfied

They look dope and are like walking on clouds Only problem is they run slightly bigger than the uncaged ultraboosts Got a 12 but 11 5 would be probably be perfect

These shoes are really great looking They are very light and very comfortable Very much recommended

I like this product because it is a Good lifestyle shoe and they are very comfortable After about 4 months the fabric starts to stretch so they get to wide and the soles become yellow

Comfortable nmd nmd mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

The shoes are comfortable and stylish to wear with any style

Fits perfect it is soft comfortable beautiful I am honored to have this shoe Send me a second

I was a little hesitant about buying these since I have never had this type of shoe before I received multiple complements and after a few days of wearing them breaking them in they are much more comfortable I typically wear a women 8 5 and ordered a men 7

Very comfortable good quality great price A

IT A FINE PRODUCT COMFORTABLE BUT JUST A LITTLE LOOSE TO RUN MANY MILES THEY ARE OK FOR GYM TRAINING BUT IF YOU WANT TO RUN LONG DISTANCES I WOULD CHOOSE ANOTHER ONE

I love the color and style I had been wanting some nmd for a while and was very pleased with the look and feel I am definitely buying another pair soon

This product is good but the problem with it is that it is hard to clean

Feels like you are wearing slippers So comfortable

Second pair love this shoe would highly recommend for everyday use

I like this product because of the confort I dislike that the boost sole of the shoe gets dirty easily

Feels amazing almost like nothing on your feet Super light weight I LOVE THEM

I work on my feet all day and these are amazing Flexible yet still stable With enough cushion to keep my feet from not being in pain

Comfort is important this pair fulfilled it love the color

The added decoration on the exterior of the bottom of the shoe rubs into the foot The black plastic line pieces

Sick colorway love this version and sizing width are perfect

it is not too bad but I recommend just getting ultra boosts

this particular pair of sneakers from adidas i will not recommend to any of my close friends or family but other adidas shoes most likely

I have had so many complements wearing this shoes I am like a walking advertisement at the gym I have had 3 different people ordered nmd Shoes on their smartphone right there and then I highly recommend you to buy this shoes for its unique looks and comfort

My son loves them He said they are little narrow but no big deal he is really happy with them

Shoes are comfortable and colors are the best Everything matches

Twas soooooo good like the best I have ever had in my life

I love nmd Series Especially this color combo Or many have seen this color

The comfort took me by surprise The lightweight design feels perfect and the style can not be beat

They are lightweight and comfortable But you have to order a bigger size than what I wear

They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

quality material quality is great

These shoes are really comfy and they look really good

The NMDare some of the most comfortable and fashionable sneakers out

Most comfortable shoes I have owned Nice looking shoes Love it

The look and comfort is the best Runs a little long

These STLT PKs are the best NMDs I have ever had It goes with anything I wear very durable and very comfortable

Thinking about getting another pair in another colorthey are that good

My son wanted these shoes he is very happy with them Comfortable stylish Recommend

Basically I like them for the comfort design and colors

Sneaker fit well but did not like the color in person

Dope kicks very comfortable and stylish must have the triple black

Im not a runner anymore but feel these are more for looks Very nice looking shoe

This is a shoe that i like a lot cause the style and comfort and it can go laceles

For me this is the best design i hever get from nmd really nice i love the product

Excellent quality and very comfortable and very light

I like it because they look sexy and the feel outstanding

Nice shoe comfy good summer time shoe need it to get warner to wear

Love it because it is stylish and comfy Purchased a pair before and was satisfied

Great shoe all around The material it is made out of is very comfortable

I like the shoe it is very comfortable for all day wear The design pattern is a little loud compared to my normal but I like more and more all the time I have received several compliments on them as well

Amazing fit Not ultra boost good but that is to be expected but still great looks and comfort

Amazing look and comfort but really expensive Fits perfectly but again quite pricy

Good

My husband loves these Gets stopped every where we go

Comfortable shoes Quick shipping Overall pleasant experience Would have liked some stickers but whatever

feels amazing

I recommend to everyone cause is the best ever shoes a use in my live

Just bought them and I got several compliments at the gym I have never owned a shoe that feels quite like this I will definitely be getting more NMDin the future

I like the nmd in general because of it is details and comfort Just wish there are more colorways for this But definetly a good purchase

Cool shoes literally and figuratively Comfortable Fit well Go on and off easy like socks I do not even need to tie them The unique look has already received several compliments and people asking about them My favorite NMD R1s so far

I do not on this product but I would like to Them shoes be lookin fresh af

I ordered these shoes because of their unique look and the comfort I have experienced Primeknit NMDs in the past My other pair from last year is so comfortable and easy to put on that they have quickly become my favorite shoes so when I saw these I liked the black heel cap and the funky webbed pattern so much I knew I had to go for them

It feels confromtable when I was running and walking

Stay tuned

Quality looked cheap the laces do not go up high enough for them to feel comfortable overall just looked like an off brand of NMDs

I like it cause it is comfortable and nice looking

Mostly everything perfect but the shoe is a little grey compared to the picture Recommend 1 2 a size down Otherwise great shoe

This is a one of a kind The STLT is an amazing shoe but not as comfortable as the ultraboost But the NMD is for street wear Great Shoe

Thanks for having the smaller sizes in stock Awesome Adidas shoes as always

Not only do they look awesome they are super comfortable Get yourself a pair

Very confortable awesome shoes this color is unique

Top notch comfort and never been criticized on my style while wearing them

A big fan of boost and Adidas PK These NMDs do not disappoint and the colorway is very easy to style Easy cop but they do run a 1 2 size big I always go down 1 2 a size whenever I buy PK NMDs

They were not the right size for me I am usually a 13 but I needed a 12 or 12 5

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Keep killing it adidas

Comfortable light material I will recommend my friends to try adidas next time

I like the comfort of the shoe the quality and the weight of the shoe I do wish that I knew that they run a halfinch larger Unfortunately they are no longer available so I can not exchange

A really awesome colorway on the NMD r1one of my favorite for sure

These are fire But I had to return it bc the mesh tab was rubbing against my upper heal Weirdly it was only the left shoe that was doing this

I didnt like how the shoes size is too big a size 10 fits like a size 11

Pretty common Knowledge that NMDs run a half size big go a half size down and they are AMAZING

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Great Great Great One thing to keep in mind is that you need to size down They run big

it is hype and ok quality great shoe very hype I am hypebeast

Now use them in the gym all the time

Very light and comfy sleek street style for the summer

they are really comfortable shoes and should be in everyonewardrobe The colourway is really nice and matches with practically anything

I wear 7 5 for ultra boosts and 7 for any other adidas sneakers and 7 fits just right for me with insoles I have narrow feet Remember NMDs do not come with insoles so to get most comfort you would have to insert a pair They feel softer compared to Ultra Boosts However for longer walks and runs I would recommend Ultra Boosts as they have more support NMDs just look prettier These especially look really good and go well with pretty much any outfits

So comfy and great for Wide Flat feet You can make the shoe even nicer by taking the stripes off

Good looking shoe I would buy again but if prime net go smaller size

The moment I tried these on I knew The materials are top quality and everything about the fit of the shoe is spot on Will definitely be buying more of these in the future

The Adidas NMD shoe line is the epitome of style and comfort I absolutely love these shoes however I was a bit disappointed with my purchase The product description for this shoe tends to be a little inaccurate and the photos are a bit misleading For example the core color tends to be more of a grey than a black In addition the heel loop is grey not black like the picture shows I would have returned them due to this fact but I bought two pairs as couple shoes for my girlfriendbirthday I could not take them back once I already showed her She still liked them but she would have loved the pair that was described and shown on the adidas website Still a great shoe but only 4 stars from me

The boost pattern looks fake fish scale looking not a big fan

These shoes and the Adidas Ultraboost are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The quality is great as well One thing I might recommend is getting a half size smaller than what you normally wear I wear a 12 but i think with the primeknit material I could go down to an 11 5

These shoes are great for walking and some running The main factor is comfort and being stylish to go with it

Great shoe and very comfortable Runs big go half a size down

Comfortable as crazy but get kinda dirty quick woowoo

Sizes run a little big Make sure to order a smaller size

How comfortable the shoe is and a perfect shoe nmn

look great comfortable sturdy would buy again and again

Very comfortable and low priced and a great feel when walking

Love the way the shoes look and feel The primeknit gives the shoe a good feel

My TTS fit is a 12 but because of the primeknit I had to go down a full size Probably the first time I have had that dramatic a size difference and I own multiple ultraboosts and NMDs That being said it is a great color way with high quality material and extremely comfortable especially for wide or flat feet I get compliments on them all the time I wish Adidas made higher quantities of these in smaller sizes so I could buy a pair of the khaki color for my daughter

I love shoes and this shoe is no exception it is good looking and is extremely comfortable

Classic NMD PK shilloette and perfect for the summer I actually removed the stripping in these for a custom look

Easily the most comfortable thing to ever touch my foot With thick or thin socks it feels like a cloud it makes me just want to stand still and enjoy Walking in them is easy too once the foam adjusts to your foot bed

The comfort is great compared to mesh nmds Never thought they were this comfy

Great basic shoe Turn it into a fire shoe easily

I sized down a full size for a perfect fit These are quite expensive for shoes but they are comfortable and constructed well

got these for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he loves them

Fits looks and overall good buy Just what I expected

The perfect everyday sneaker I actually am a10 5 EEE I went to a size 11 and have a perfect fit The plugs are smaller than the r2 which I had to return would love to see a black red pattern similar to what came out in r2

Walking with these shoes feels like you are walking on clouds It is extremely comfortable and wraps around your foot like a sock

Best shoes it is very confortable beautiful it is perfect shoes

Perfect shoe for FatherDay My dad absolutely loves this shoe

Perfect stylish comfortable versatile wear them all the time

Great shoes Get many compliments on them every time I wear them

Solid addition to the ever growing NMD Pk line Goes with everything and great city sneaker

Love them look and comfort wise BUT the fabric is fraying after only 3 weeks of wear Very disappointed especially given the price

PK is amazing but the sole is some what uncomfortable

Great shoe no complaints at all All around solid shoe

Very conformtable shoe with a clean look can not beat that

Very comfy looks great and very stylish Love the compliments

I Normally wear an 11 5 and I bought an 11 and they are still big just wish the sizing was more accurate

It is so light weight and comfortable It is like walking on air

Start by saying I love the shoe Super comfortable when worn with higher socks Problem with the tag on the back though Spent a weekend at the zoo and downtown walking everywhere and the pull tag on the back of the shoe rubs your ankle RAW Footbed is as comfortable as can be but back tag is a killer of an otherwise awesome design Maybe I just got a bad one

it is so comfortable and light I would really recommend this

Shoes are too big need to exchange foe smaller size

My 11yr old son bought these and loves them He says they are very comfortable

Best shoe I have purchased in the last 5 years hands down

Very comfy and looks very nice but I believe it is not true to size and it runs half size bigger

It is a good looking nmd However the boost on these particular NMD are different than on other ones The boost on these have a less distinct nipple

The shoes are softer and more lightweight than I thought

Ended up returning the shoe because it was uncomfortably too big The width was perfect but the length was about 2 sizes off The comfort was okay not as comfortable as the ultraboost but okay The only other thing that bothered me was the heel loop on the back was super rough and rubbed my ankle raw Probably will not buy another pair

these are dope but shoe fabric is a bit loose at the front

I love the feel of the material and shoe is light weight The comfort level is amazing

This was supposed to be my replacement for not getting the Parley Ultraboosts but I managed to buy them later which is why I am returning this pair

amazing shoe i lobe it to death its my bby and fav thing

Amazing going to order in more colors The shoe is so comfortable Easily my favorite shoe They look much better in person

Very comfortable for the use I have for them This is in line with my experience on shoes I bought from Adidas but the added benefit is the design which I really like

Everything about this shoe is perfect The only bad thing is that they are hard to clean but I guess that is just how it is with white shoes

Comfort is great The shoes look even better in person

ran bigger than what i normally wear like the fit

I got a 7 5 which usually fits perfectly with any other shoe but this seems to run large When walking the primeknit on the inside of the foot will overlap and basically not fit to the foot completely

Sad I I had to return this simply because it ran a WHOLE SIZE too big

great looking and comfortable shoe highly recomend

This is a fantastic designed shoes with perfect materials color and style I loved it

My son loves this kicks but one sneaker differs in the back The loop is angled inward and the rubber material is thicker than the other and rubs his ankle bloody but he will not let me send them back

Great shoes This review request is a pain in the rear

Super comfy I was skeptical at first with this show lacking any type of support structure around the front

This shoe is very comfortable to wear when walking around town

Easy to wear perfect color matches most of my personal clothing

They run about a half to full size too big But other than that they are great

I love the shoe the only problem it runs to big

First sneaker with BOOST and i love it so comfortable feels like you are wearing nothing on your feet The response when you walk in them all day and your feet do not hurt

I am a womensize 7 and bought a 5 it is perfect

Exceeds my expectations and fits perfectly yoooooo

I find that the pkare like walking with just socks Super lightweight and comfortable Perfect fit I got TTS Breathable shoes

Really nice shoes Super comfortable and great style

It has an amazing design and extreme comfort I really recommend this shoe

The color way is great the comfort level is above average not a big fan of the tab on the back but other than that a great product

Runs large I recommend a full size down size They are good but if you want to feel the primeknit well

I love this product because it is good looking and goes with anything

I bought these shoes for my boyfriend and he was ecstatic He is constantly getting compliments on them and is always telling me about how comfortable they are I even got myself a pair

I have other shoes of this kind and was interested in the color

it is very nice very comfortable and the style is amazing

I love everything Adidas is dropping right now

It stays true to size The material is very comforming to the feet Daily shoe

Any boost material shoe is great 10 out of 10 Definitely would recommend

I wear an 11 5 These were way to big they fit like a 13

Great shoe thought I was unsure to buy it at first but it looks better on feet then pictures

The product has style with comfort Can wear all day with no hurting feet

These NMDare so fresh I am not gonna wear them until my wedding day

I found it difficult to clean a spot on the mid sole where the boost technology is It was a little dirty and I attempted to use Jason Mark cleaning supply but it did not successfully clean the spot I am an avid support of Adidas and I have about 11 pairs of ultra boosts but this pair is my least favorite

I am a major hypebeast and while these NMDs do bring the hype they also are both comfortable to lounge in and to walk run in

Looks even better in person than online in the pictures

Too large and I wanted them to fit smaller in other to keep them

It is a very comfortable shes and can be a shoes that i can wear everyday

This product is very comfortable However the sizing is large Typically in a size 10 ordered a 9 5 in these shoes and they were still roomy Ended up returned them and getting a size 9 instead which fit perfectly I rated the quality slightly less because there was a minor imperfection on one of the side stripes

Great execution on an already great silhouette Boost is life

I like it because of the colorways and also the prime knit looks nice

This is a really good shoe The Primeknit and Boost combination is great and the shoe is very light and has good ventilation The only problem with the NMD PK is the size I wear size US 11 in Jordans and 10 5 in Yeezy V2s but I had to get these in 9 5 for a comfortable fit Even then there is a little bit of room but tying the laces well solves that problem I would suggest going down 5 or 1 whole size I have not worn this shoe much but I will definitely be wearing it soon

Comfort and style Been wearing them everywhere since I got them

did not like how it looks in person probably going to reuturn

1st pair of nmds and boost very impressed comfort also quality is good will most defintely be buying another pair and have also picked up some ultra boost post getting these

Comfortable shoe Good purchase for price and very stylish

I love the primeknit sock line and the color of the shoe

Sweet original shoes have two pair Scared to get them dirty

New favorite shoe the comfort of the shoe is amazing

great looking shoe better than i imagine and more

Light weight with great support and amazing design

Good looking shoes that run true to size Only gripe is a minor onethe heel tag can chafe

The fit is true love the colorway and the boost is nice and firm

I love the shoe Had to go a whole size down because they run big

I can fit in 9 and 9 1 2 because of the unique opening of the shoe Recommend bigger size than ur usual size

Ver comfortable Great summer color way Good quality

I love the materials and the comfort of this shoe

Comfortable and it looks good and love the color too

Love these shoes I will be buying another pair Add running socks to these shoes and it is like slippers for training

Great looking shoe Way too large though had to order them twice to get the right size

Usually a ten and a half with the xr1 but this was a little on the large size Still dope

I bought the shoes with the idea of reselling them but when they arrived i couldnt bring myself to do that The shoes were so comfortable and looked great that I could not possibly sell these away

The Primeknit NMDs fit so well and feel really great Not as much cushioning as the Ultra Boost Line but more than enough for daily wear

the adidas NMD is a great shoe for casual wear and is extremly comfotable however the sizing runs atleast a half size to big i usually wear a 11 5 and got an 11 and i still had a little wiggle room great shoe though

it looks great but it is not as comfortable as it looks

these shoes are very comfortable you can wear them all day without them making your feet tired like wearing jordans all day these are not basketball shoes they do not hurt your feel after 4 hours of wear

Great pair of kicks in person one of my favorite NMDs in recent history

These shoes are always super lit A little narrow for my feet but still very comfortable Love the color scheme and the look I am in love

Good looking shoe Comfortable Solid purchase Buy with cinfidence

The most comfortable shoes in the market today Love it

Sizing is hard to get right with these shoes 10 5 was way too big yet the size 10 seems a little too small

Great comfort and looks great I would recommend this to anyone who wants quality nmd

Very comfortable and light weight but sizing is off Too big for me

Great color way Remind me of the zebra yeezys glitch camo nmd

It is my second favorite nmd shoe that I have in terms of quality but with looks that is is the best

Got this for my daughter 16 BD She been wanting an NMD forever Now that I got her this one she is even more in love She said it is so comfortable that you do not even feel like you are wearing shoes Size and width wise are perfect to her size she is a 7 so I got her size 5 in men and it is fit her perfectly

Wish I would have gotten asize smaller But other than that the shoes are amazing

My girlfriend loves it it is a tiny it too big for her feet but she just put an insole in and it fits great

it is exactly what I wanted Goes with everything Very comfortable

Very comfortable and versatile shoe The shoes go with several outfits

the sexiest most comfortable shoe i own and a perfect shoe to look like you have the sexy runner look without running

These shoes look and feel amazing Very nicely crafted

it is just great performance could not expect more just love it

Love the way they feel I own 3 pairs of NMD PK uppers and they are all amazing Sizing on this pair was the best though

Sucker for the Glitch Nmd Colorway Primeknit is only Nmd I care for Run 1 2 Sz big and Nmd comfort is far from ultra boost 93 17 or YZY level but put your UB insoles in your pk nmds and thank me later Only con imo is that the retail price point should be 150 For 10 more the ultra boost is much more worthy but limited to colorunless you can get limited or Consortium releases

Great comfort highly recommended for maximum comfort

Really nice shoe can match easily an very comfortable love the shoe

The product has the best feel and is wonderful for a traveler

Definitely recommend this shoe

I really like the shoe overall but you have to get a 1 2 smaller then you actually wear

Great gift Got these for a friend and they loved them

Very comfortable better than the yeezys in my opinion

The pk and boost seem differentOn this pair then all the exclusive pairs

The boost is awesome They are really comfy and responsive Great shoes to wear everyday and have a really nice design and fit They take a little to wear in and my heels hurt the first day but after the break in period I love them

Comfortable as heck Adidas is on top of their game

The shoe is very comfortable and comes in several colors

Top notch Comfortable and stylish love them A must have for summertime

I like the color way and the Primeknit and I like how it feels

Looks great and fit and easy on and off Love the comfort and looks with jeans and for working out

Most comfortable shoes I own now Even more comfortable than the ultraboost

I liked the item because they are good quality and comfy

The shoes run too big Should go 1 2 or 1 size to have a perfect fit

Love the style of the shoe as well as comfort Fit is not exactly right

The style of the shoes and comfortness are the best

I love this product but I would like to say a heads up on the sizing would be nice

Best looking shoe but comfort is not where the ultra boost is

Goes with everything has a great color stands out

Nothing beats boost for comfort primeknit is also super comfortable

Very classy And fancy too I like the color Size fits me perfectly

Great shoe primeknit is key color is flawless adidas has again hit it out of the park

This is my first NMD R1 Primeknit and it did not dissapoint Granted the r1 does not have the boost feel that other boost shoes do but it is still much more comfortable than the average shoe Looks nice to would recommend

These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had They are like a big breathable sock However back part that touches you ankle has stitching that wore through irritated my skin I assume that this goes away after the shoes have been broken in I recommend to wear more than no show socks when you first get them Other than that they are great and are easy to match to casual outfits

I was a little skeptical of purchasing this shoe at first because I was not sure of the sizing due to the primeknit material If you are Interested in buying this product I would recommend that you go true to size for a comfortable fit If you like a more snug fit I would recommend you go a size down Overall this shoe turns heads left and right

They are the most comfortable shoes I have put my feet into

They feel awesome to wear and look just as great on me

Looks good and comfortable just go half a size down Love these shoes

Comfy shoe Nice colorway What you expect from NMD

These shoes are so comfortable And I love the style as well

Love the fit and look of this shoe it is a must cop



One of the pair came with stripe bended out Not glued correctly

9 5 fits like a 10 10 5 how is that all the nmds are different depending on the material it is a joke adidas needs to step up there game

Adidas is the best Adidas fan since day 1one

Shoe is comfortable but the back on the heel start to bother after a while

I would like a refund because the glitch pattern was faded and there were errors in the stitching of the PK

This is my 10th pair of NMDs and they go well with everything Love the way they fit and most of all how great they look My Ultraboosts are definitely more comfortable but my NMDs are more for style If you are buying the primeknits they tend to be a half size larger so make sure you go with a half size SMALLER then your normal size

I felt the material was too thin for the price of the shoe Also no arch support which is important but willing to forgo if the style is right The sock ankle support did not fit snug around lower ankles and had a fold in it Absolutely love the Adidas NMDand with this the look is there just needs higher quality thicker material

Very comfortable shoe Great style Was alittle expensive

Love the colors of these shoes So light and comfortable

Its a must cop for the summer time Its keeps your feet feeling good

Great coloraWay perfect timing for the summer Wish all adidas shoes were this easy to obtain

Great shoe If You have nmds then you know how comfortable they are specially the primeknit versions I am usually a 10 but 9 5 fits perfec

Adidas knows what they are doing now and days coming out with new shoes that are A1

The shoe itself looks dope The ankle elasticity is nice but they definitely needed to be broken in as the first couple of times I wore them they causes some pretty uncomfortable friction on the back of my ankles That problem has since faded after wearing them so often Great pair of shoes

Very comfortable shoe with a beautiful color way It is a perfect fit and looks really sleek on the foot

Always love the cool NMDbut color wave is a bit boring on this model

Really like the prime knit and color Being that it is primeknit it fits a little more loose But other than that great purchase

Great looking shoe and amazing comfort Love the whole collection

Great colorway for the summer Keep in mind the Primeknits always run 1 2 size too big

The shoe fits great true to size Easy to walk in and looks good too

I have been waiting to get a pair of NMDs And hopped on these Back leaves a blister really easily And your toes will stick out the sides a little

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn feels like I am wearing a sock

NMD shoes are very comfortable and looks great at all times

Love this shoe make sure you order half a size down as it runs large amazing sneaker

So comfy I love these shoes order a half size smaller though

These are fuego A great summer shoe and goes with everything

Good design and looks great on feet Love the width of the sneakers since I have wide feet Comfort wise the sneakers are in the middle compared to ultra boost Though this can be remedy easily if you take insoles from a pair of ultra boost and add them to your nmds

Unparalleled comfort for work or play I stand on my feet at work all day and these shoes look great support and cushion my feet from fatigue and pain On my days off are perfect for a run or just goofing around

the whites have beautiful detail comfortable shoes that look absolutely dope pictures do not do it justice

Amazing fit style and super duper comfortable Highly recommend prineknits

Good shoe good shoe good shoe good shoes good shooos

love the nmd R1 wish same male color ways came in woman

They look great but they run about a size and a half large I normally get a 10 I got a 9 but maybe should have gotten an 8 5

The shoe is very light comfy and looks awesome with the khaki color

Very soft and comfortable shoes I love the PK version of NMD

The most comfortable shoe out on the market period

Great colorway and comfortable shoe Had to go a half size down though

The most comfortable pair of sneakers I have owned I am a 7 5 in womens regular sneakers 6 5 primeknit nmd and 7 regular nmd but sized down to a 5 in menand it fit perfectly Such a cute color scheme for summer Most comfortable shoes for leg day

it is a nice definitely would purchase more Perfect for wide feet

These are my 4th pair of NMDs love the colors and fit

I personally love nmd r1 shoes and I had not ever owned the primeknit style It is extremely comfortable to wear and I definitely reccomend this product

A real nice addition to the NMD lineup Great colorway What can I say

They are so comfortable to wear Ive been trying to get nmds ever since they came out so im glad I finally got a pair

Amazing looking and fitting shoe Love the comfort of the PK Runs half size big

It was ok but it was way too big I usually wear an 8 5 and I ordered an 8 5 but it felt way larger

Dope color great sole and cushion Would recommend to a friend

So comfortable and stylish I love the ultra boost as well as the primeknit

I like this sneakers because of it is earth tone color and it is also stylish

i do not understand why adidas does not tell people to go down half size in these they run entirely too big too wide there is no way anyone who buys these true to size will be satisfied with the fit

it is an inch longer than my big toe which I got the size I usually get I personally think it looks a lot better in the pictures than real life

comfortable but sized to big like the color and quality

These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and the flexibility makes my feet feel less confined than any other shoes I have worn before

The shoe is very comfortable It also looks really nice The way the shoe looks is great and the way it feel on the foot is great

Nmds are extremely comfortable ver good color way

Adidas has really been stepping up its game Kicks are always fire emoji

i was wearing them for three years now they are trendy and comfortable

Really comfortable and nice I just bought these this morning and already love them

Comfort and style

Fire Get a half size smaller than you normally would

Nmd is a great shoe just wish adidas will start with colored stripes instead of same as body of shoe everyone recognizes adidas with the 3 stripes white stripes black tri color makes shoes pop

Great shoe overall I got a lot of compliments i got the tricolor ones

Ordered on the original release date and they were huge Gave them away as a present then went a full size down when the are released later in the month PERFECT So comfortable A little less cushion in the ball of the foot compared to ultra boosts but still ridiculously comfortable They look as good as they feel

Beautiful great looking product I was not to get my size

This shoe is definitely not for anyone with a wide foot

Good looking more perfect good to wear must try best shoes I ever had

Hated No support what so ever Bought several pair

This shoe is amazing in comfort and the best in design Adidas is on point combining the simple design with its boost technology And the color ways are breaking necks when people see you wearing them

I love this shoe of the future like adidas should be proud of them selves and adidas please make more of the Glitch camo pK 

1st I like adidas cause of comfortable and stylish I have noticed since 10 years ago Most of sneakers style still reuse the idea from 80s you know what brand I talking about Now adidas come with the new idea and style sneaker which everyone love it But one cons is really hard to get them Hope adidas can improve this problem

I absolutely love this shoe And any primeknit for that matter Please make more primeknits Make them available to customers like me who buy them just to wear them Favorite shoes in my closet NMD LIFE

I like the NMD Primeknits I have been copping select NMDsince the beginning The shoe does run a bit big but you will learn that after your first purchase The Primknits are definitely my favorite I have several pair and yes they are very difficult to get especially going against the Bots Smh

Got lucky with these kicks Very comfortable and light

I love these NMDtheir comfortable and look great with any fit

Best show ever my second nmd and they are so comfortable

I was able to get my size in the new primeknit colorway pretty easily very excited to get them in Love the whole nmd line probably my favorite shoes out

Provides beyond maximum comfort and breathability

Amazing casual shoe and decent running shoe By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have bought many shoes over the years and these are the most comfortable The white boost soles do take some upkeep as they do start chipping away over time but I guess it is the price for extreme comfort I have had mine since the original ones dropped and they have been amazing The primeknit is very breathable and does leave your feet a bit chilly on cold days

I have put these shoes through extensive running and walking The block elements on the sole dig into the side of your heel that will cause blisters The mesh versions will not last 3 months running and the primenits last around 5 months until they start breaking apart which I still wear because the mesh hasnt separated from the sole A good shoe that looks great but not that much of a great runner with all of the boost technology

Feels like socks Lucky to have been able to cop a pair No bots needed

Good Quality and does not go on sale very comfortable

Amazing shoe One of the Top colorway out Super comfortable and stylish

too hard to get a shoe that is alright and not that comfortable

Great Product Would recommend Adidas is the best shoe company

The weight and ventilation is comparable to socks

Love your variations of primeknit uppers And the shoe is very durable

Boi I swear ill kick everyonewoo ha who gave 1 star

Why not get them there very nice and comfortable

very comfortable and stylish and very simple colour

Comfort and stylish good price Unique for all

Great shoe nice style comfort and style

Just not a good shoe They did not fit well at all

Very uncomfortable Sizing is off Bought these for my son ripped within a week

These are FANTASTIC In my opinion the most comfortable Adidas shoe available Definitely go a half size down at least these run large If you grab a pair that is a little too big just put in an insole since these come without

I do not get the hype with these shoes They do not fit properly and they hurt my feet Looks good tho sizing is off

There is a huge difference between these and the regular mesh NMDs The Primeknit is a much softer and conforming material and I would 100 recommend trying to get them when they drop Most comfortable casual shoe ever made along with the UB

Good style and good price and good color and comfortable

Hurts my anckles fam please do not cop fam Listen to me fam

the shoe dose not look like the same once you have them in your hand Also the shoe makes your foot feel like a boot

Brooks running shoes are the best if you are serious about running or walking nothing compares bedlams are my favorite and provide the most cushion and support finish line also had the best price and I have shopped around for these

Best pair of New Balance I have ever owned super comfortable

Comfortable pair of sneakers at a great price for work Needed something I could stand in for long periods of time Had originally planned on wearing my ultraboosts but get foot fatigue when standing in them for long periods of time These look great got them in the peach color Good support have a relatively narrow and flat foot Best thing was the price got them for less than 40 on sale when they retail for 100 Great shoes would not hesitate to get them another color in the future

I love these and will probably get another haha

He likes them a lot and he looks good in them Very stylish and comfortable shoe I would have to get me a pair next time

So comfortable I love these shoes my son is currently in the same size as myself so i constantly stealing his shoes these are sooo comfortable I wear them all day and my son really likes them I had to buy him a diff color because the red and black are more like a neon pink and black so I took them and currently wearing them He wears his other pair I bought him Thinking about buying a couple other pairs for us both With being on my feet all day and my son plays sports these are awesome

Bought the black and red pair except they were pink The pictures do not accurately show the color Will be returning

It says its a casual shoe but i take 50mn walk in them and my feet do not hurt I work 12hrs a day and no issue Best purchase i could have made Looking to make another in a different color

very comfortable price is great feels like walking on air great on the back i hope more colors come out

Fit perfectly well comfortable and fashionable Different from the normal black timberlands Good feets

I have ten pairs of timbs and they all look and fit great The cement colored boots are awesome I get compliments on all of them whenever i wear them

These Timbz keep my feet dry and warm Used it for some light hiking in the hills of NH

Boots are easy to wear with anything look stylish and durable Great buy for the price i got them 119 tax

My son was very surprised and loved them The chocolate brown color is fabulous

great boot can be used for outdoor indoor casual look fits comfortably no issues

Been waiting dark pair beside Black fits well and looks great

Love the boots Made with quality materials Will buy more boots in the future

Great boot stylish great fit Good for any kind of wear dress up or dress down Made tough to last too

Broke in quickly Very comfortable and high quality I work on my feet all day so I only get high quality shoes and boots This is my first pair of Timberlands and I am very pleased So far no leaks or wet feet and that is critical in my line of work

My Hubby just had to have these boots so I surprised him and got them for his Christmas gift and he absolutely loves them

Fantastic boots I bought these as a present for my husband He works in a trucking company and he loves how they look and how comfortable they really are

I am really excited and happy with my purchase I have wanted this particular boot for awhile now and I finally found it The price was Great If Finish Line continues to have sales like this I will purchase the entire line

These boots are terrific for Chicago winters Absolute perfect combination of looks and functionality I will say that these boots are also very heavy though

I live in the city and the winter can be harsh These are perfect for that kind of weather They are great in the snow and the insulation is great for the cold climate I would definitely get the leather ones they are great and look nice I have wide feet and tend to use an 11 5 in any Nike Air Max When I used Timberland I have to go down to a 10 5

i am a natural 14 would The HOVR Phantom Rock runs small Love the shoe otherwise

Best project rock pickup so far Amazing for lifting and running Great subtle but bold design Love it

I am in the army and we run almost everyday and these shoes are awesome

love these shoes When they broke these out I knew I had to get the Shoes of the People and they were freaking awesome HOWEVER I have 2 panels on the bottom of my shoe coming loose and I have only had the shoes for about 40days I have not put the shoes thru much not like the trainers so there is no reason for them to already be coming apart Hopefully they can fix this issue and come up with better quality next time

The Bluetooth feature is amazing It let us you know how you ran and tell you what you need to work at so you can run better

This shoe is extremely comfortable and looks great Use them for running and in the gym Size is perfect and is tight and secure and does not feel heavy or anything Great shoe

This is my 4th pair and I love them Really like the rock collection and under armour gear

I got to be honest these are probably my favorite shoes to wear whether I am at the gym or not they are definitely the most comfortable and I really do like that they are smart my only downside to it is that the smart tracking does not natively tie to Google fit or Apple health kit you have to use like two other under armour apps to get it to connect to Google fit which kind of sucks but the shoes are definitely cool hopefully they will update the shoes to natively connect to other third party apps Google fit health

I am 10 5 but I have to return the product and buy a half size bigger 11 That is the only problem

I owned a few different running shoes and this is by far the best and most comfortable

The shoe has a super soft footbed and is a great ride for walking and running However unlike the trainer I had to go up a half size to accommodate the width of my foot Also the shoe does not have a removable footbed so if you wanted to wear an orthotic then is would have to be a slim version The shoe could have used a tab on the opening rear foot for easier and quicker putting on and taking off Once you get past all of that it is a cushioned ride with good support

Awesome shoe I thought it ran a little small Overall great shoe Feels well built Love the connect feature

I love the buoyancy to it it is supportive on all around dynamic and static movements A major upgrade from the Previous pairs Well done Under Armour and Project Rock

do not know why the rock has anything that runs small since the game plan Shoes are great just too small Had to get a 1 2 size larger than his last 2 shoes It does not matter what your name is

These shoes are awesome Great fit very comfortable Would buy again and gladly promote to my friends and anyone who asks

Great shoes very comfortable runs a 1 2 size smaller than the previous Project Rock shoes

I wear a 10 1 2 in all other shoes I bought a 10 1 2 in the last rock shoes they were to big so i got a 10 in these and they are to small if i go off what the size chart says it says i would need a 9 i bought a 10 and they were still to small

I have been using them for my football lifting and conditioning and they are great and really comfortable

Although I am very satisfied with the look and comfort they are very difficult to get on and once they are on put a lot of pressure on the Achilles tendon

Great shoes at great price great shoes for walking or running recommend going true to size even if you have a wide foot I am a 2E wide and fit great 4E go up 5

I have been waiting for Rock running sneakers I love the training shoes but Project Rock always needed a set geared to a runner as well These are not just any running sneaker either they are Bluetooth connected to give you all kinds of running Metrics The fit is snug slightly on tighter side but that is how it should be I love these only tried a 3 mile run and it was very comfortable looking to try these on a longer run

I bought these shoes a while back could not be happier with purchase Ordering was easy delivered on time Great shoes for a great price

Very comfortable shoes easy to order online and delivery is on time

Great for shooting around the gym yet stylish enough for hanging out

They are super comfortable Especially considering that I wear Achilles braces on both ankles I thought fitting my feet with the braces would be uncomfortable but I was wrong The braces do make the straps on these sneakers almost useless But besides that they are great Traction is great fit is great cushioning is great they lock down very securely and the style is simple and subtle compared to other sneakers I am actually buying another pair for when I wear out my current pair

I just got these and they are really comfortable once your able to squeeze it on lol The fit is tight but not overly tight you have to get it the shoe then it is really nice They look HOT and the deal is even better

The sneaker is what it always was since the 1990s I like it though the orange is a bit brighter than I thought No complaints whatsoever

Love the style love the color I found a nice Nike shirt too

Great quality and very comfortable Every Air Max fanatic should have these

I am a true airmax fan this color and style caught my attention So glad I made this purchase

Great price and super comfortable Stylish with a capital 

Classic shoe with updated colors can not go wrong with these

Very comfortable Always turns heads I love the shoe

To stay 95s are heavier than what you would expect for a running shoe but these are more for style than running in my opinion They run a little small so with most nike I own my 95s have to be a half size larger They are easy to clean off comfortable and a good value

The shoe is very heavy They weigh a lot The shoe is not a true size 8 In fact one shoe is a little bigger than the other They are a little narrow I would never purchase these again I love the design but the heaviness and other factors have determined my decision to never buy these again

The shoes are absolutely adorable I would go a size bigger than what you are thinking I bought these for my son and they were definitely not the blue and bright orange I was anticipating They are absolutely a purple and hot pink So I will be returning them but they were adorable If I did not have to wrangle a one year old to force then on I would probably keep them But being they are too small AND the color was not what I expected I will just order a different style

Runs narrow and snug on feet I ordered a size larger than I usually wear but after about two weeks of wearing them they are extremely comfortable I can wear them all day unlike other shoes I stopped buying Nike shoes because of their poor quality and how uncomfortable they are compared to New Balances However I do not like rocking my gym shoes 24 7 and do not like looking like a dad at 22 So I bought these They are made out of nice materials and look awesome I got the whites with red blue accents I never thought I could stunt so hard on these hoes being a Caucasian male

I would like to start by saying I bought this shoe a full size up knowing that the 95s have been historically narrow and knowing that my feet are wide and they are still a pretty snug fit for my feet I think the shoe tongue design is especially detrimental since the tongue has a collar that extends around your foot further compressing it which adds to a slight sense of discomfort

Very classic shoe Could never go wrong with a pair

Love air max products Comfortable fit and lasts long

I love these Air Max 95 Denim because I have never seen like these denim material shoes I really love the material

I got my first air max Wasnt expecting too much because technology wise its made from the 90s I was surprised Because quality is perfect and its very comfortable

Love the shoe and feel when on feet No other shoe wraps and snugs the foot like 95s Would highly recommend to those looking for a stylish OG shoe with durability

I love my air max 95s I bought a pair back In 09 and wore them all the time for working out I weigh 230 and am very hard on them and they lived up to the challenge until now so I had to get another pair Im so glad nine are released this shoe

I have a narrow foot and these shoes are well paded and fit perfectly

Great shoe Love the colorway Would recommend to anyone

This shoe has been the best style of Airmax since they made them Long time fan and for years to come

Shoe fits true Clean and stylish I recommend this show to everybody looking for a cool walk around Nike air max shoe

I absolutely love Air Max 95 and these all white leather are awesome I have big wide feet and unfortunately these shoes fit small to size and are narrow so if I could get them in a size 16 wide or 15 wide that would be awesome I am a lifelong Nike fan and air max 95 are my all time favorite shoe and I love these just wish they fit a little better

Best sneakers I have ever bought Style and comfort these have it all

This has to be my favorite shoe of all And I have several air max and air Jordan This shoe not only feels good it looks good The 95 air max rocks The only thing I wish is that one day theyll come out with a kids shoe I would love to see my 3year old daughter with a pair on

This product is very comfortable fit long lasting and stylish Great for exercising

This is a very good looking and perfect comfortable shoes

Love the new look of the Air Max 95No only do they look good but they are extremely comfortable

Love the quality and the fit of the shoe Classic Blackout is a timeless shoe

This shoe perfect The sizing is a little tight but the quality is great

This show is very comfortable but have one flaw the bubbles pop easily so I do not recommend for outdoor use This is more for running indoors or over flat surfaces

This is a great shoe for working out and just wearing for a casual day

The air max 95 is a classic model the premium leather on this air max is great a perfect shoe for Independence Day or supporting our nation

Great color for this classic shoe Also has the peanut butter bottom

I have been running with these shows since they came out years and they still my go to

I love them just as much as the other ten or so pair I have owned since the original release in 1995

Very comfortable shoe I walked around Nashville for hours and never had an issue or any discomfort The colorway is really nice and the hidden 3m details were a nice touch I would highly recommend these for anyone that is a Air Max 95 fan

Love the Independence Day colorway goes great with most outfits and pretty comfortable Laces add a nice touch as well with the gold aglets

Worn out once The shoes were comfortable and fit snug like all 9

Love the gold tips and very comfortable one of the best airmax shoe made

Never has any pair of Air Max disappointed me Comfortable fit true to size awesome color way

This is a beautiful shoe perfectly executed a super comfortable The Premium version of the Air Max 95 runs slightly smaller than the standard model but is much more durable I wear 95as a lifestyle shoe and with so many color options there is no beating it I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone weather for running or casual wear Nike please bring this back to NikeID

Love the colorway designed for the shoes and the gum bottom makes it look like an limited edition airmax 95

This was a classic since birth probably about my 7th pair of air max 95and the still feel so comfortable and the pretty durable as well a must have for all sneaker heads

Always loved this shoe from 1995 and love it to this day Love Nike do not ban us beat us

This color way of the legendary air max 95 has to be one of my favorites The quality of the materials is superb which means that the shoe will have great longevity The 3M accents are a nice touch and really help your feet stand out in low light conditions The only complaint that I have is that the 3M stars on the sock liner are what seems to be stickers and I am pessimistic that they may fall off with normal wear I was hoping that they were going to be like the stars on the lace overlay Regardless you get a premium shoe that fits true to size and is sure to last you a good amount of time I would definitely recommend

The cushion is really good Very comfortable sneaker for training or everyday walking sneakers

The shoe looks great and feels great other than being a little narrow

I love how the quality of these sneakers and the endless amount of colors that they come in

I love this shoe From the way it fits to the way it looks

The best of the classic shoes from the Heavens I must say these are even more comfortable than the original version thanks you Nike for a wonderful product

This is honestly a great shoe I would really just wear these to work out and to also just chill

I order sneakers from Nike all the time These sneakers run pretty small compared to other Air Maxes retro and new I own I thought removing the insole for a week would help the sneakers stretch out but they have not really budged I bought these in grey and white The white ones feel more snug than the grey ones The toe box is pretty small on both I have narrow feet and wear running sneakers 95 of the time I wear sneakers Next time I know to avoid these

I loved the Air Max 95 when they came out Glad they have released them again Run true to size Perfect fit comfort and look to be very well made I just ordered two more to put on the shelf for when these wear out

I would recommend this pair of shoes as they are very comfortable and look good too

Good shoes must buy more from your company thanks in advance

I love nike because nike it is one of the best brand in the world

The 95 is the best air max of all time Super comfortable and stylish for any occasion The shank gives me a added boast1 air max 95 fan

Just purchased this pair and can not say how satisfied I am with the product I was already a big fan seeing the pictures online but the actual product is even better once you get your hands on it Fits great and feels very comfortable A MUST HAVE

Very comfortable and not that heavy Very breathable and provides great arch support Love these shoes

I searched and have tried a varied of products to provide comfort and support whether it was a short walk or logging on a 10 mile day I purchased my Air Max 95 a few months ago and I have been completely satisfied with them Additionally I have found that the shoe provides the needed support in joints and back that help enable me to get out and walk 2 3 miles at a time As someone who is diagnosed with a debilitating muscular skeletal disorder the additional support helps minimize additional strain and damageand allow me to work towards proving my mobility and endurance I strongly recommend this product for those who struggle with injuries and could benefit from the additional support to reduce impact

I was kind of skeptical on my purchase due to me nerve owning a pair of airmax and boy am I satisfied with my purchase

Always been a huge fan of Nike Air Max sneakers Great sneakers

I love them Fit very comfortable and appears to be durable

Perfect for anyone anybody ready for anything Great for running or dress shoe for jeans fresh 501Clean nike air max

I wore these shoes twice and the second time the fabric split right down the middle This is two orders in a row from nike Time to switch to the reeboks

I have other Air Max 95 sneakers and none of them fit like this version This new mostly all black sneaker is nice looking but the overall fit is strange The shoe is wide over the top of the foot but narrows alot at the toes Ordering a 1 2 size larger than your regular size may help with the cr and ed toes however the width of the shoe may tend to be too wide

Really comfy shoe I used to have the old ones back in the day Those were the days

This shoe is the best air max ever made IT IS SIMPLE BIT IT IS COLD aIR MAXES ARE THE BEST SHOES JUST TO WEAR PERIOD

The online picture is a nice light blue color air bubbles and lace ups the shoe I recieved has purple and yellow instead lace and purple air bubbles The shoe is a great shoe however the color is all wrong

Upon slipping these kicks on right away I was taken back to my cross country training days in high school this shoe was great for long distance training then as it is now Sometimes things get better with age and this is definitely proof of that

Only complaint is they run a LITTLE bit small

this are some good shoes but they run to small in size

I like the shoedefintley buy 1 2 size bigger than you would normally buyI paid postage x2

The shoe feels great on my feet Runs a little small though As with all Nike products it is build to last

The most comfortable awesome classic sneakers in the world

This grape colorway is awesome The shoe is very comfortable but be sure to try a half size bigger because they run a little small

Great shoes Great fit very comfortable but not as comfortable as the AirMax running shoes In the running shoes your feet feel floating not as much in these shoes Yet they are still very comfortable

Greatest sneaker ever made A sneaker classic for the ages



This is a pretty shoe Very nice and comfortable it is also cool looking

I was caught up in the hype and bought the neon green black grey shoe and was dissapointed with my purchase The dimensions of the shoe seems off and it is not comfortable in my honest opinion I highly value a combo of comfort and loos and for the shoe there is a compromise I had to buy inserts to deal with the hard ride this shoe provides It looks good at an angle but dead at 12 the toe box looks ugggglee this will sit dormant in my closet wish I bought another shoe

I have been wearing Air Max 95s for 15 years and Love them

i like these especially because they are blue i have purchased every single color thats come out this year Its very easy to match so its definitely a must if you love air max 95

Truly a one of a kind sneaker This is my 4th pair of Air Max 95s and I have to say this color combination is the best Very comfortbale and stylish

I loved these shoes when that came out in 95 I was really excited that they are out again

great shoes nice look i have all colors now neonorange red mint blue not good for running there only great for casual wear i will buy any other new colors that arrive

That have retroed it a few times and my favorite is the Neon Green but the colors are always slightly off The air bubbles seem to be not as comfortable this time around for Team Orange The Team Orange 95 is comfortable and supportive and the ankle and heel of the the shoe But at the front of the shoe eventhough there is Air there if feels kinda flat

Very comfortable good for running and walking I also love the style

This shoes is an instant classic a must have a this style never gets old which is why this keeps on coming back and this color way is one of my favorites

Trying to locate for a long time Excellent shoe and service

i lik this shoes

This is my 3rd pair of Air Max 95 and the build quality of this pair is subpar compared to the 2 older pairs I have The left shoe has a slight irregular shape and some of the threads are exposed

Love It these shoe is fire they very comfortable and they look great too

I wish Ithey had more colors to choose from but the white with lava is too fem for a dude

This is a very comfortable and stylish shoe The crocidile accents on the shoe make it different It goes with everything If you are looking for a black shoe that looks good and is comfortable this is the one

This shoe is defenitely a classic but I really wish that the new technology of the 360 air bubbles could be added onto the origional design All Black

These shoes fit small so make sure you get at least a half size bigger

Not quite as solid as the HOA but I was pleasantly surprised when they popped up on NDC

Great and classic shoe A well made retro of a popular named shoe



This is one of the all time favorites of many Nike customers and Nike did a great job again For the best fit you may want to go up 1 2 a size to have enough room since this is a narrow cut running shoe The traction and cushioning are great This will be a classic for many years to come

this color way brings back middle school memories no matter how much they change them from the originals they will always be one of my grails

THIS are are RETRO OF THE 1995 CLASSIC IS STILL COMPARABLE TO THE OGs ALTHOUGH A BIGGER AIR BUBBLE WOULD HELP JUST LIKE THE ORIGINALS I WISH THAT NIKE WILL NOT RELEASE SUCH CLASSICS AS QUICKSTRIKES OR EURO ASIA EXCLUSIVES SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO OWN A LEGENDARY SHOE WHETHER ON THE TRACK GYM OR SIMPLY CHILLIN THE NEON 95s WILL NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE

Marketing Dept PLS retro this colorway by far TOP 3 of the best colors for air max blue and cool grey as well very comfortable and stylish This colorway would be a shoe in to generate a large amount revenue since they are so rare i know i will buy 5 pairs

Please release this colorway again Very comfortable shoe very stylish and unique A great addition to your collection that has truly stood the test of time Simply put an instant classic

One of the best sneakers of all time Hopefully they are brought back again for us to purchase The gradient present on this shoe is spectacular and the neon accents truly separate this shoes from the many others Shoes fit great and feel amazing with the comfortable air bubbles pillowing your feet

I am a big fan of the Nike Air Max 95 I have almost every color made I wear mine mainly for style They are also very comfortable I really enjoy these shoes I would recommend them highly

Looks nice black blends with the white really well like the old school 95s very comfortable on the heal and arch Fits me just right

I needed shoes that could be worn year round good with rain and with good cushion I did not want to buy the regular Ultraboosts as the upper material is knit and soaks up water easily These mids are more water resistant and still provide great cushion The upper material feels snug but stretches easily Also the black colorway I got is straight fire The only drawback is if I have to pick is the neck of the shoes that prevent you from slipping on the shoes with ease

I like it Love it

Shoes are very comfortable and stylish I would purchase again

These UBare ranked amongst the most comfortable shoes in my 150 shoe room that is all I need right now but the minimalist styling is not to be overlooked either even with the technicolor candy soles Great design Adidas

This is a very comfortable shoehowever please keep in mind the Light Granite Light Granite Silver EE3732 020 model is not accurate in the pics The eyelets three stripes and toe box are all white not grey Check ADC for more accurate pics These pics are not accurate and are actually misleading

Great shoe all around my son loves them He is a runner and thinks not only do they look good but fit perfect

Other than being 1 2 size to small these sneakers beat just about any sneakers I have purchased in comfort If you want a nice looking pair of sneaker that are extra comfortable then you will love these

Bought these for my brother and he says they are the most comfortable shoes he is ever owned Admittedly even though they are too big for me I try them on all the time and I fully agree with him Nothing I have even comes close to them They are also really stylish According to him they stay comfortable all day and he does not experience any fatigue They are also pretty breathable thanks to the primeknit upper and it is small ventilation holes As far as fit he is a true size 11 but opted for an 11 5 and he says it is perfect He could have gone for his true size too but preferred having extra room True size for a snug fit half size up for more wiggle room at the toes He went with tripple white They get dirty pretty easily but they are not too hard to wash If you do it manually only use soft bristle brushes for the upper to avoid fraying Hard bristle for the boost If you want to do it through a washing machine stick them in a laundry shoe bag Highly recommend this shoe

Very comfortable They feel like your walking on clouds

The color of sneakers its great and its very comfortable fells great in foot hard not wear all days

Price was a little steep but the product was good

I have bad feet and with these shoes my feet do not hurt anymore

Love the shoes Use them for my gym workouts super comfy

I like the product because it is very comfortable and goes with a lot of clothing

Best shoes I have ever worn They are incredibly comfortable and I can not go without them I have tried other shoes but after a few weeks in they usually give me pains unless padded running shoes similar to ultra boosts Still even those shoes do not compare For a student athlete whose constantly moving from class to class with heavy books I can say this makes a difference in my life and takes away many foot pains I strongly recommend as running shoes or as lifestyle shoes for anyone who walks a lot They are expensive but 100 worth the purchase In terms of sizing I recommend going to the store to try on the size for you If they do not have them in stock or they do not have your specific color it is still good to know what your size is so you can order it online

AMAZING SHOE XTREMELY COMFORTABLE WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE

The shoe fits perfectly is extremely comfortable and the color wave is absolutely beautiful

I like it because it is comfortable go true to size but the boost and shoe are breaking apart and he boost is breaking that can be seen also it is breaking and very dirty easily that can be noticed

Great fit looks good with joggers and pants good cop

Very Comfortable and Great Looking Boosts Looks better then on picture

Look and conform unite as one and leave the others behind in the dust

I bought this for my boyfriend after his complaints of constant sole pain from other shoes A family recommended we buy this because of the comfort he experienced in wearing ultraboost We do not regret buying this He loves it

Order a half size up

Super bouncy Great look I order the mens 7 5 and am a woman9 Fit perfectly

Talk about comfort and feel This shoe has both Ultra boost rocks

This is my second pair of ultraboosts and it will not be my last As always these are very comfortable breathe well and the boost cushioning feels like walking on a cloud Cannot reccomend these shoes enough They are pricey but they are worth it

Not only have I fallen in love I have made family as well

walking on the clouds

Own two pairs already Super comfortable sneakers great for gym Highly recommend

Ultra boost shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes i own I have these and the prime knits i think they are called and both are amazing I feel no difference with these being recycled plastics which only makes these shoes more appealing Overall great shoes will buy again

Went to pull laces tight to tie shoes and the laces broke the rubber holes Now only using the 6 holes to lace up so it is not as fitted at top of foot

I love the support I feel like I am walking on pillows

Love the shoe but it has glue all over the bottom

Great purchase Most comfortable shoes Great for going out and gym

Love these shoes amazing cushion love the mid high design

This is my 2nd pair of Ultraboosts Extremely comfortable especially when standing for extended periods of time

Feels like I am on pillow very soft and great for running

One of the most comfortable running shoes I ever had

Without a doubt the comfiest pair of shoes I have ever owned Stylish and can walk on them for days without any discomfort Only thing I wish I could do is customize the colors 10 10

it is a cool shoe no doubt The attention to detail is great and the fire esque colorway will give you the pop you want in your wardrobe Premium materials Excellent comfort Perfect silhouette

The shoe overall is really comfortable and looks better compared to other running shoes if you plan on using them besides what they are meant for The quality is great and it has similar features from previous ultraboost versions which I like

The 3 0 UBwere the loosest of the primeknit and are supremely comfortable but going true to size may be too large I would recommend half size down if purchasing 3 0 TTS if 4 0

Very comfortable the size perfect I can wear this shoes all day without my feet hurting

The ultraboosts are a modern and sleek shoe for any occasion and well constructed The comfort lives up to the hype and I would recommend this item to anyone on the fence

ULTRA BOOST the only way to go So comfy and stylish

I do like the bottom Comfortable but I can not order width because not available even I order half size from what normally I do Still too tight after long day I wear it I feel To squeeze I hope they make them in width soon

Its looks nice and its comfortable the variety is really nice too

This is the 3rd pair but this pair is already wearing really bad on the tread The last 2 pair lasted about a year If this pair keeps wearing like this the will not last 6 monthThe price is high if they are not going to last

Super light and feels comfortable while running and for leisure

Lightweight comfortable and well made 1st adidas sneakers I have bought in over 10 years not gonna wait that long for my next pair

The boost technology is amazing for my morning runs

These are soooo nice I have never worn a more comfortable shoe in my life

Great shoes overall Looks great feel great Got a lot of compliments on them

Loved the material and wanted something comfortable Could easily walk miles all day and still be comfortable

Shoes are exactly as advertised Solid for walking

Amazing shoes I had been wanting them for awhile and finally bought them They are so comfy

Very comfortable beautiful colors glows in the dark

Getting an awesome shoe plus helping with the Ocean project at the same time cant go wrong with Parley

very comfortable shoes that can be worn all day Stylish and comfort cant be beat

Overpriced shoes that are comfortable and needs a wider toebox

I usually wear to gym Because of the light green color I should not use for jogging outside much but I do anyway WhyBecause I love the design Perfect for being lifestyle sneakers

The best purchase and most comfortable shoes I ever purchased

Most comfortable shoes to wear for someone who walks at least 4 hours in a fast paced environment

I like it but do not so much because of the amount of money

Love the fade from front to back The colors are really vibrant and perfectly match the black

The design is nice and simple A must buy for everyone

These shoes are extremely comfortable and look awesome

took the advice of many to go a half size down and they fit perfectly

Great for leisure wear and running Breathable shoes and colorway are cool

The shoes are very comfortable and quite stylish

Love it Shoe is the most comfortable adidas shoe I have worn

Just got the shoe and really love this Would love to see this color way on the regular low ultra boost

Best product from adidas line up Fits perfectly and comfortably

I always have difficulty finding a great reliable sneaker but I have found it in the Ultraboots These sneakers have changed the way I evaluate sneakers and I highly recommend getting a pair and feeling how great it is to walk run or exercise in them

i like it because the comfort and all white they look and feel great

Great sty easy to wear and look at would buy sgain

My feet really hard to buy a shoes cause I usally hurt my back feet and also some time my back get hurt cause I move to much for work After long years of many shoes then I tried with adidas I change my mind adidas help me no hurt my feet and my back anymore I really appreciated adidas

This UB in classic black goes with anything I like it very much it is size is just a little bit larger wider than normal but not sure you need to order 1 2 size smaller I wear size 11 5 and typically prefer loose fit

I bought a pair of Ultra boost shoes via the adidas website Ultra boosts typically are fairly expensive compared to other running shoes However IMHO are worth it They offer amazing comfort and bounce They give me an extra oomph on the treadmill and the gym Plus they look great just walking around town Love them

Amazing comfort size and width 10 10 would recommend

Bought this pair for my boyfriend not just because he is a GOT fan but because he is been experiencing foot muscle pains the past few weeks The boost technology helps alleviate a lot of that stress and pain in his foot allowing him to endure standing at work with a lot more ease than before He is especially into the GOT accents like the pull tab Overall Ultraboosts are always a win and the GOT collar is just a bonus

I recommend a 1 2 size bigger than what you wear Your feet breathe tremendously and the soles are very comfortable

Awesome shoe for run and style Possibly size down half size

I love this shoe so much it is super cool looking and really fresh I wear them with no show socks and the look is awesome Since buying my first pair of 3 0 two years ago I have purchased 7 other pairs and now have way too many to wear they are all so comfortable and super easy to be active in All the color options keep me coming back for another pair

Great shoe I get lots of compliments about the Game of Thrones

These shoes are high quality insanely comfortable and worth every penny you spend on them

Purchased this to help with my arthritic condition in my feet and ended up with 3 pair Raw Desert CORE BLACK CARBON ASH SILVER and Gray Three LOVE the sock like fit of this shoe

Very comfortable and lightweight Looks great and feels even better

Boost is Life I already have NMDs and some basketball shoes with boost and like them a lot After wearing the ultra boosts for a day the additional cushion is obvious it is like walking on clouds and I already thought the NMDs were good Ultra boosts take it up another level Toe box is a little tight and overall might be just a touch short Going to see how they break in Love them and need another colorway

These are the greatest shoes i have ever had They are so comfortable and lightweight And they are a hypebeast Item so you know you be wearing the fresh kicks

needed new running shoes and got these They are perfect love the comfort and style

Nice color way perfect for the summer months The heel cup is different from most other Ultraboost shoes which is nice

My favorite running shoes Perfect fit So comfortable

Keep buying this shoes

The primeknit is so comfortable like it is in all ultra boost but the fleece lining on the inside makes it so much softer The leather and fleece make it look so much better and gives it a premium sort of look 10 10 Would Buy Again

After reading numerous reviews about these shoes I would agree these are the most comfortable running shoes for every day wear They feel like I am wearing socks They provide excellent cushioning and the toe box area is wide enough to wiggle my toes while providing support

The Ultraboost is lightweight comfortable and breathes well

Great shoes and very comfortable Highly recommend

I am pleased that the white sidewall does not stain like the last few adidas shoes I have bought

The style fit and comfort bring me back every time

Can walk for days with this one and I hate walking lol

Comfortable shoe great for walking standing or running

I like this product because of the all white and it is super comfortable

This shoe is extremely comfortable I have tried several brands and styles and this shoe has done the job for both comfortability and appearance No barking dogs at the end of the day

The most comfortable casual shoe you can buy out there its okay for running and I mostly use for the office

Great shoes for daily use when you are on your feet a lot

I love the cushioning of the shoe but it definitely fits MUCH smaller than what I was lead to believe online Would recommend every guest buy 1 2 size larger than their normal size

Whats not to love about an ultraboostSpecially these parleys with everything its stand for Looks comfort and a great cause

Very comfortable shoe overall though the fit is a little tight for my preference

I cannot say enough how much I love these sneakers I have the triple black 3 0and the blue 4 0 and they are constantly in my rotation along with my eqtAdidas keep making these dope colorways and I will be sure to buy more of these for sure

I dig how this shoe looks like it could be beat up worn hiking and still maintain great looks However since it has fleece lined uppers it is very warm and runs small I usually wear an 11 5 and a 12 fit perfectly

Its the best walking and running shoes ever best quality ideal for whole day wear

I just bought my last week the moment I tried it on was like I have been wearing it for a long time It is the only shoe that I try on without slipping at the back Buy them if you have not

The product is great but the box sent by Adidas clearly was a returned item and has been used Disappointed on not receiving an unopened box

They are a very comfortable pair of sneakers They are exactly as advertised

it is so comfortable to walk around with Literally bought 2 more pairs

I now own two pairs of these shoes Personally I have a wider foot so I went a half size up and they fit really well The only change I would make is adding more options as far as colors go The white part on the bottom gets dirty very easily and it is not the easiest to clean Overall this shoe is the very comfortable regardless if you are using them for running or just as a every day shoe

The shoe is comfortable convenient easy to use Love wearing these shoes

I absolutely love this shoe My back and legs do not hurt like they do with other shoes I want every pair

A really nice shoes but I just need change a size

Great shoe very comfortable After wearing I immediately went and bought another pair Also got this pair at a great price compared to full price

My children have big feet so the shoes fit them just fine

Great product for great price Will never buy any other shoe besides ultraboost

Fit perfectly Extremely comfy do not ware off fast Just a solid shoe

Good for everything Gym Comfort running love them

All i can say is that this collab with adidas and game of thrones is one of the best I love game of thrones and if you know already UB is a very good shoe Nothing much to say

Extremely comfortable and fashionable what is not to like

My shoe came with glue showing around plastic area It was disappointing i had to return it and it was a limited edition

it is not comfortable as i I would think It hurts and numb my foot after two hours of walking around in San Francisco I will not order again

These shoes are very comfortable for running Plenty of cushion for daily training

A company like Adidas doing what is right by the ocean today will be in business for a very long time My only wish is for an expanded product line using recycled plastics and a way to further the cycle by send products back when they are no longer usable

Great And super Comfortable Adidas is My New only shoes Ultra Boost

I love how comfortable it is Also they lood amazing on foot

Good shoes but little tight on the toes in the front

A must cop for all the GoT fans they look great

Good quality materials and very confortable Best shoes i own

I really like the full primeknit upper and the boost is one of the best versions I have worn And I have tried Pureboost NMD EQT Yeezy 350 and others I prefer the feel of Ultraboost more than all of those Go true to size if you like a snug and secure fit They are about a half size small but the stretchy primeknit flexes as your foot does

Comfy great for dads not too flashy subtle wash friendly

Bold colors on this UBs would be nice if Adidas has more unique options

I love the way this shoe is built you feel the quality in the material and the fit Plus it is a very stylish shoe

Love the product I will recommend it to anyone that walks all day

The product is very handsome light responsive and very comfortable

Perfect fit and great color way Love this shoe very comfy

Coming as a new sneaker and a collection item you would think the box would come undamaged First thing I noticed was that one of the sides of the box was ripped and the nice Adidas GOT paper was ripped as well Instant negative vibes I do like the GOT touches they put into it Nights watch back tab tongue on the inside lace tips fleece inner lining and the GOT insole

this is one of the most comfty shoes i ever had Never regret buying this shoes

I have been looking at the Ultraboost for a while and glad I finally bought them They are definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I own which is important for my work where I stand 3 4 the day

I love the Ultraboost line for comfort and general simplicity of design So much sneaker athstetic is complex and unnecessary shapes colors and forms The Ultraboost 4 0 line is a simple modern design with unmatched comfort from any other brand that I have tried

really comfortable continental sole is much thicker on this than on regular boosts which is big

The size fits great and the comfort is next level

Great shoe style comfort performance Just love them

The sneakers look even better in person the quality is great and ultra boosts are always comfy

Everyone who loves game of thrones will love this shoe

The build quality and comfort on this thing is out of this world I would highly recommend to go up half a size as if I just bought my usual size it would have been waaaay to small

It looked even better than the picture nice balance in color too

It is very comfortable Definitely recommend Lives up to the ultraboost name

Got my third pair of Ultraboosts and I think they are some of the best shoes for casual wear They look sick and feel amazing Will be getting more

The color and its perfect to my feet and the style is so unique

This shoe is extremely comfortable and matches everything They are my go to

Wore it everyday to work No complains at all Especially if you are on the go these shoes will hold up

I wear these shoes every day standing at work and my feet never hurt

Very comfortable and provides energy back just waiting to see the durability

Shoes were a perfect fit and the comfort level exceeded my expectations

I think that this shoe is very comfortable but there isnt great airation within the shoe

everybody already knows the ultraboosts are one of if not the comfiest shoes on the market The GoT colorways are amazing and have very unique touches if you are up to date with the show Amazing

Shoes were dirty in some spots were not wrapped in tissue and tag was lying in the box not attached to the shoes

Style and design are second to none I love Parley

very comfortable nice color very good look they complete the look

 xc3 xbaper quality and extremely comfortable Perfect for work

Adidas ultra boost are super comfortable shoes They look great and can be work anywhere Wether it is to working outb or for casual wear I love it

Comfortable stays tied and looks better than any other shoe on the market

I have to say I really liked the Night Watch version of the GOT Ultraboost collab This version takes my two favorite shoes which are the Ultraboost and the Ultraboost ATE and combined them into one The material seems thicker on this shoes and the leather cage the fleece lining makes the shoes looks more premium The ATE out sole looks rugged and should provide good traction in wet weather while for sure will last longer than the regular version I also love the black white contrast of the shoe While the colorway definitely do not pop as the some of the other version this is definitely the easiest one to wear on the daily basis Highly Recommend it

Design is really nice with the dragon flame effect across the upper looks great Lots of nice touches from the House Targaryen logo at the back of the lip to the Fire and Blood tag in the back and the house name on the laces Really comfortable since it uses ultraboost tech

Honestly love Ultraboosts and these did not disappoint They are so comfortable to walk in and the design is even better in person than online

Navy Blue and the white contact really well as well as helping the environment makes it a great show On top of all that it is an ultraboost

This is for all the GOT fans Team Targaryen Great shoes fits and feels nice But could have made the packaging a little more nicer since this is a limited edition

I love the way these just mold into my feet Shoelaces really are not required I could go untied and never worry about them slipping off or even coming off my heel The black looks so sleek I love these shoes

Would buy it again for friendo i am a big fan of got

Already a fan of the Ultraboost The Game of Thrones limited edition is a big plus and it retails at the normal Ultraboost price

My first pair of Ultraboostand by far one of my favorite purchases of the year Being a big fan of Game of Thrones I get shouts when I am out wearing them are those the TargaryansGreat purchase recommend 100

Game Of Thrones fan and love the colors of the shoes

Never disappointed with Ultraboosts They are always so comfortable and the GOT addition makes it even better

this game of thrones color way is straight fire

These Game of Thrones House of Targaryen shoes are the essence of style Totally in love with the stylish red mesh upper with the black accents Would have given a perfect score but for the unisex sizing I find the arch support better in the Ultraboost Womenshoe and wish they had been offered in menand womensizing That being said I usually wear a 10 and 1 2 in womenand ordered this shoe in an 8 and 1 2 and found the fit to be perfect The size chart indicated that I should order 1 size down from my usual 10 1 2 womensize but 2 sizes down was right for me Great style and great shoe

The attention to detail on this colorway is without a doubt impeccable The mixture of red orange and yellow to give the fire breath look is stunning I love the little touches of orange to give off the impression of embers Adidas and GOT knocked it out of the part with this collab Keep this up Adidas and I will keep throwing money your way

Been wearing adidas size 10 for years This size 10 is really a size 8 Fitment is poor

Super comfy I love the style looks amazing I can wear these every day

Every shoe company should make a wide version shoe Maybe they could do it in the especially popular sizes 10 11 5That would be really cool Adidas I would buy a second pair if they did this

if you like game of thrones and want a sweet looking shoe

I love this brand And this shoes was very comfortable

The best running shoe there is They feel and look great by far my favs

It looks great and feels amazing on foot Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

I usually have to stand for a couple hours a day and these keep my feet nice and cushy

Great shoe and design Comfortable to say the least with boost sole

Best colorway You can not go wrong with triple white

These are the best Wish they had more options with all black soles but still love them

Very comfortable shoe I get compliments often on them often My extremely wide foot makes the inner cage support pieces stick out of the upper but it is not very noticeable and does not impact comfort

This shoe is so comfortable and is the perfect combination of style and performance

very comfortable shoe I highly recommend if you have been contemplating on this purchase

Beautiful and comfortable best ever shoes thank you adidas

Needed a size up The shoes feel like the cloth is going to rip soon and I have only been wearing them for 2 weeks

This is the most comfortable shoe ever Love the color and it is well made Love Boost

Comfortabale on another level They look amazing they give the modern look However wearing it for long time might be a pain if their tighted up all the time that should make sense

Great shoe great quality true to size but a bit narrow go up half a size up and you will be good Will buy more colorways soon

I just love ultraboost it xc2 xb4s the best thing since Running Shoes

I absolutely love these shoes this is my third pair of ultraboosts I wear them out with jeans to the gym and during my 12 hour night shifts at the hospital I have never worn a more comfortable shoe

Shoe looked amazing and comfortable but it was too small I will try getting maybe half size or one size bigger when it is back to stock

After wearing these shoes when on my feet for 12 hours straight me feet have never felt so good

it is the perfect shoe because it fits every need The comfort is next level

comfortable with just enough support great everyday walking shoes definitely worth it

need to take care not to dirty very white but very comfortable and breathable

Very light perfect for running and classy look Must recommend if you do long run

This is my third pair of ultraboost and I love them But this pair felt a little too big

I liked the shoe because it brought a light vibe in my outfit

Like the style of Shoe Looks great on feet only con wish I had went a half size up There a little narrow in the toe box

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever wore

Ultraboost as usual are very comfortable The only minus is the cage is a little snug unless loosely laced

All the other reviews are correct Get a 1 2 size bigger and you will be good

Very comfortable great lifestyle sneaker looks nice and fits perfectlyboostforlife

Sizes and color were readily available and shipped within 2 days can not wait to buy a 2nd pair

Highly recommended this ultra boost shoes It is comfortable and can walk for a long distance without feet aching

looks suave fresh and confident my Superstar track suit Getting compliments the comfort is life changing we will see when Spring arrives how much better they perform when I run

Ultraboost remain the most comfortable shoe to me The white and all black go with everything

I heard a lot of good things about the Ultraboost I finally decided to get a pair and they are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes My feet are happy

Love the color and comfort Great details and concept

First pair I purchased Easy to get on and off Looks and feels great

I have been wearing these Ultraboost on a vacation trip in which a lot of walking was involved These shoes are stylish and yet extremely comfortable to walk in The trip convinced me to pick up a couple more pairs just because they work so extremely well

My so a favorite running shoes to date He is really hard on his shoes so really I should review in a few months

The comfort will blow you away

Fits and feel like a fine leather glove with a cloud like cushion Most comfortable shoes I have ever had My one complaint is the white soles They tend to absorb some types of soil especially clay It is impossible to get the sole back to its original white color It looks very dirty very quickly I have to spend extra time with these shoes trying to get the soles to look clean and they never look really sharp after a few wears

Great fit and looks great Only downside is how perforated they are

need more colors to select from in my size also woudllike ot see more 1 2 sizes at 12 5 and 13

Great colorway So comfy Hard to wear any other shoes after these

Great shoes that can be used for running and look good too

Boost is life for me I literally gave up all of my other shoes just to stocked up on 2 pairs of ultra Boost everything they say about them is true I Will say this if you have a job that requires you to stand for 8 hours or more I had little bit of discomfort other than that their amazingBoost Is Life

Great shoes I would recommend to anybody best shoes I have ever bought

These shoes are very comfortable I highly recommend these shoes

You know these shoes are awesome and so do I now Look awesome feel awesome

matches with anything and the colorway is nice

Great running gear This confirms my commitment to adidas

The fit was a bit small but the shoe itself is super clean and very comfortable

I just received these yesterday and I love them I ordered a half size up and I am glad I did They fit perfect and are so comfortable I wore these last night for cross training and they were perfect Definitely recommend

Love the color blocking of these NMDs the orange hits are great They are not as comfortable as an UltraBoost but still great for all day wear

Shoes fits as I expected Super comfy can walk for hours in them without any discomfort Would highly recommend

it is a lightweight comfortable shoe I went half a size smaller and the fit is perfect

I am a big fan of the 4 0 ultraboost so when this color came out I knew I needed to add it to my collection Definitely need to go a half size up as they run short

First time owning a pair Adidas very comfortable and stylish I like them went to store to buy some pants and top to go with my Adidas

Would buy a different color the most comfortable shoes ive worn

I absolutely love the ultraboost Best shoe on the market

Really nice and very comfortable shoes I definitely recommend buying them

My son loves these shoes and said they have style and comfort

This is my first pair of caged Ultraboosts and they are phenomenal I have only had uncaged pairs before and while they both have the same ultra boost sole these caged models 1 up them on the convenience factor for putting them on I have always been a fan of the Parley collaboration with Adidas and was very pleased with how the color way on this model looks in person Definitely looking forward to when I can get another pair

Do not like the BOOST in sole coming out every time I take off my shoes Surely we can do better than this 

This shoe is super comfortable and the boost is the best part I would go a half size up for these

I like the design and the use of white with some pastel colors but the colors are not overbearingsimple and clean Appreciate you designed this so that the insole could be removed to allow for different insoles

comfortable toon my foot and the material use was excellent

it is very comfortable However I noticed a small defect

Ultraboost in general are really good shoes There so comfortable and the quality is amazing just order a half size bigger

I have found with UBI need to go up a half size usually but I love the color and wear them with black joggers all the time Would recommend just size up

This shoe is by far the best running shoe i have ever owned I am proud to run in this everyday Honestly the boost foam technology has improved my run time It made me faster and also got rid of my shin splints I will never use any other shoe ever again Boost for life The ultraboost runs half a size small though so might wanna up half a size But overall its perfect From the minimalist upper that provides maximum comfort its like hugging your feet to the ultra responsive boost sole that improves every strike this shoe is an 11 10

Support comfort style The available colors are top of the line

Perfect shoes Comfort stability stylish Thank you so much Adidas Will be ordering another pair in black

I have had these shoes for a little over 3 months and the boost on the bottom of the shoe is starting to split around the ball of my foot The interior lining on the back of the heel already has holes in it and I have about worn a hole in the green insole They are super comfortable as all ultraboosts are but the quality on the pair I got is absolute trash

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Definitely worth the purchase

I have worn energy boost shoes since2012 and I loved the tight narrow sock fit I wore them without socks and they fit will and didnt chafe at all

I wanted to get back into running but other shoes I tried did not reduce impact These however have a very comfortable land Downside the knit on top does get quite dirty even within the first few days of use and I am unsure of the efficiency of washing them

The shoe fits extremely well I think its a little wide but still fits evenly well I work out in mine Hoop in mine and have not had a single issue yet highly recommend these awesome shoes

Do not know why Ultra Boosts do not fit uniformly All black colorways seem to be more narrow Need to fit more consistently across all colorways so buyer can take the guesswork out of buying on line

Due to the material of these shoes cleaning is difficult as they cannot be put into the washing machine

No tongue and can just slip on and off to the gym

Very comfortable but need better color choices for future purchases

a perfect everyday shoe most comfortable shoe i have ever owned however it is better for lifestyle wear than running or working out because it is not the most supportive shoe

Supportive and looks good with anything I have a hard time running in shoes without my feet hurting and these truly feel like clouds on my feet

they are nice clean shoe Very comfortable 3rd pair all very good shoes

The quality of the Ultra Boost has deteriorated significantly over the years The stitching between the two shoes was off and the fit was very awkward and tight I have owned all four versions of this sneaker and the 4 0 fit very small and narrow compared to the others Go a half size up AT LEAST

They are extremely comfortable They can be used for many things like running or playing soccer and are overall a great shoe

I am on my feet for 8 hours a day and they provide great support

Very comfortable pair of athletic shoes they stay in place and support your feet

Incredibly comfortable I weigh between 220 and 250 depending on the year and can run for days in these I have purchased multiple pairs because they are so good They fit a little snug at first and the base can be a little narrow but for the most part fit true to size

I like the boost and the comfort that it provides the ultra boost Are a stem up in comfort from the nods giving a little more support and comfort over all they are both great shoes and I have 5 pairs of each she

Bought them as casual shoes turned into my go to workout running kicks They are unbelievably lightweight and the comfort is unmatched Now if I could find those nights watch black thangs you dropped we would be in business

The boost mid is incredibly comfortable and the prime knit upper is very breathable Seems to run small I had to go up a 1 2 size

Great shoes Definitely reccomend Very soft cushion

Good overall shoes fit and quality Price is on the high side though

I like the product but needed to return it because it was too small

I love my pure boost Near perfect but I feel the lack of insole makes the shoe a little too firm The Ultraboost has great cushioning but is way way way too narrow I wear a 10 normally I have to get a 11 5 I do not have a wide foot but its so tight that the plastic sides start digging into my foot if I wear my normal size

this is another great comfortable shoe with boost and a soft upper material

Although these are pricy they are worth the money in my opinion I ordered these as a present for my fianc xc3 xa9 but I own a ladies pair and wear them everyday and LOVE them My fianc xc3 xa9 works on his feet all day and wears his at work too So comfortable They do break in a tiny bit so do not be worried if they feel a little snug at first

Most comfortable shoes Adidas makes I have multiple pair

Amazing quality and comfort in addition to stylish soles

it is a great product Very comfortable Looks good with shorts and pants

The shoes did not seem as comfortable at first as I had high expectations for them but after a couple of uses they seemed to become more comfortable

I have over 4 pairs because it is the most comfortable ever

So far great for the gym

The shoes tend to be narrow a little hard to put in the feet although I alreay ordered 1 2 size larger Shoes are very comfortable and perfect for running or walking

These are so comfortable could be just a little cheaper

Prefer the comfort of the Parleys over the regular ultraboost I own ultraboosts and the parleys are my favorite They feel the most snug and I still went a 1 2 size up

I ordered a 10 they are too small for me A 10 5 would fit Ive never worn a 10 5 before Wish I kept the box to return for bigger size Its a lot of money for a shoe that is too small to be comfortable

Very durable and beautiful sneaker Color and style are perfect

I own many pairs of Adidas shoes and this is the first pair of Ultraboost I have purchased They are without doubt the best Adidas shoes I have ever owned

So people ask about size but i say true to size i wear a size 9 5 in my circle knit nmd r2 normal nmd not the pk and i got a 9 5 in this i gotta say it fits good I like my shoes snug but with a little toe room and this really works If i had gone a half size down id be right at the tip and that plastic toe guard would be a little annoying very comfy midsole thi

I love the aesthetic feel of the shoes but they run a size to small I bought an 11 but their too tight on me and hurt my foot

Sizing is about a half size to a full size too small For that reason I bought a size up Otherwise perfect for the gym A lot more support than my NMDs which was needed NMDs are still the most all around most comfortable everyday shoe but needed more support for running at the gym Love this shoe

I definately recommend this product

I stand on a concrete floor for 10 hours a day at work I have tried dozens of different shoes for all day standing comfort and nothing else comes close If you stand all day and work in a relatively clean environment and you are looking for the most comfortable shoe you can get look no further This is definitely the one

The mid is one of my favorite silhouettes The color way is amazing in person

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

I have been wearing them for a month on a daily basis I have only used them for casual walking no running but they are holding up excellent and are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

It is super comfortable and the quality on these shoes is amazing

Everythingfine but except for the sole had a little yellow color on it

I got my first pair of ultraboost in november 2018 since then I have got me 5 pairs I replaced pretty much all my shoes for ultraboost solarboost or nmd Boost is just out of the league

My son loves them it is 2nd pair of same shoes for him

It is comfortable Shoes runs little bit small so recommend to wear half size up

Great shoe very comfortable nice design highly recommended

Comfortable and looks great The shoes feel great and when in them all day

I liked the product Stylish and comfortable The material is thin so I would becareful because they could rip

Feels great and is very comfortable especially because I have flat feet

Comfortable and great look Love the design and quality

The ultra boost cushioning is easy to feel compared to other shoes

Finally I love the overall shape and design of these It stands out from the rest of the ultraboosts This red teal color is gorgeous it is actually a bit darker than depicted in the images which suits me just fine It gives it a more subtle look allowing you to substitute it for any casual outfit that requires dark shoes

The shoes are very comfortable and quality is great

The Adidas UltraBOOSTs are the most comfortable shoes I have purchased The Boost technology provides the best cushioning in a running shoe today As for the sizing they are mostly true to size The color schemes that Adidas offers in the UltraBOOSTs are always on point

Shoes were super comfy and great overall loved them

One of the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

Shoes arrived and are very comfortable Probably most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I wish they came slightly wider as I have wide feet but nevertheless they are a great pair of shoes

I bought these shoes for my friend since she had worn out shoes so I bought her these and she does not want to go back to any other shoe

Going a half a size up is the way to go with these amazing show

The shoes I got not only look beautiful they also are so comfortable I can wear them and be on my feet all week

I love urltra boost they are the best shoe out there

I usually wear a 9 5 but got a 10 on this and it fits comfortably I have spent long hours running and standing on these and they are comfortable aired and overall a great shoe

Great shoes I own several pairs and will continue to purchase them

comfort and quality is amazing Perfect for running and working out

Very comfortable shoe that breathes quiet nicely Love the colors and that it is a shoe made out of recycled water bottle found in the beach Great running and lifestyle show

I am on my feet all day and my kids enjoyed the comfort of the Solar Boost I tried the shoes but they are way too narrow and run small

Like the looks and they are comfortable The run small so buy the next size up If you have narrow feet you will be fine but my feet are normal width so they feel snug but wearable

Very comfortable and stylish and looks great on True to your normal size

I usually wear an 11 5 but decided to go up 5 a size and get a 12 and even that is pretty close to tight I would say go for ONE size up from what you usually wear

Great quality shoe and very sleek looking Would definitely recommend

Simply awesome Quality comfort style It has it all

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Never had a blister

As everyone already knows the comfort is a 10 Style to match would highly recommend

Running long distance in these may not he very good on the joints as they lack some support But for track season im sure they are going to be perfect Style wise they look great and I can already tell they are extremely durable Im proud to wear and represent Adidas

I am a true 13 I should have bought a 14 they fit as long as I take the insoles out

This product is very comfortable but the size is running a bit small It would be perfect if the shoes are 1 2 size bigger

High quality and great fit Looks good with almost anything and can tell they are going to last a while

Love these shoes Super comfortable and great for the gym

The shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Very comfortable for ever day use running walking errands Worth the money

More structural support than my previous pair of ultra boost and even lighter

Heaven delivered these shoes down on us Boost is like walking on soft angelic clouds

Comfort is key You like walking on clouds then Adidas Ultra Boost is for you Feels like angels carrying you everywhere you go

I wear a size 9 5 in every other shoe brand This shoe feels like it is a full size too big The fabric also has started to come apart after 1 week

Comfortable as it gets stylish and long lasting can not get any better

A very good pair of ultraboosts Fits a little too small

Hope customer service can make this right I am a huge ultra boost advocate

The plastic things Adidas stripes make the sides of the shoes tight Otherwise no other complaints

Ultraboost are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever had For some reason this particular 4 0 in the core black white midsole does run a 1 2 size smaller compared to my other 4 0 Ultraboost in the turquoise black colorway I have wide feet and wear a EEE in dress shoes As soon as I removed the insole these black Ultraboost fit perfectly

Comfort style fit Can be worn either in the gym to run or casual shoe you all be in comfort no matter which you use for

Light and comfortable with excellent shock absorption

Super confortable Hard to keep them clean since they are white Would buy again

Yassss Queen Like OMG I can not even with this shoe it is just like walking on clouds then boom sike it is ultra boost

My favorite shoe

I bought these for my mom and she loved them She asked me to buy 2 more pairs

Feels like a sock and extremely comfortable The cushion on impact feels like a cloud These shoes makes running a joy

Awesome They look amazing and they are very comfortable

The product is really great Super comfortable and fits my foot nicely Definitely a must buy

I owned a pair previously and like it so much had to get another pair

Very nice look and very comfortable wish I could order in all colors

Best shoes I stand all day and this is Mr favorite ago far

nothing needs to be said about this product you have seen countless great reviews comfiest shoes ever no cap

Great shoe for walking or running around all day they are light and have good grip for most conditions

good shoesizing slightly off from Adidas typical

The adidas shoe is very comfortable and looks great on

Great quality and comfortable shoes would definitely recommend

Looks very nice but feels like cheaper shoes from other brands

Great shoe I would buy again Great color Very comfy

GOAT of shoes Ultraboost are the most comfortable shoes ever Have 10 pair

Very comfortable and extremely versatile do not wear in rain

Very nice and comfortable love the fit and the color Highly recommend

A little tight for the top of your foot kinda gives in a little more pressure due the the upper inner sponge jutting out but others still a really good shoe

I understand why this has become such a popular casual sneaker built for all day comfort and the knot is a great quality

Extremely comfortable for all day wear with cool factor

Very stylish and classic at the same time the comfort is defiantly there since being boost and matching it with your clothes is not a problem when its time to get ready for what every activity

Feels like walking on clouds and i wear them everyday

Super comfortable looks great seems to be very durable

Excellent fit and very comfortable Great support

Super comfortable recommend go 1 2 size up delivery slow

The shoes are Very comfortable they fit great And they are very light and good with running

Comfortable sneakers Too narrow across the top Run a little small

This was a great birthday present that my boyfriend loved I wanted to get them in my size as well

The comfort of the shoes are great The price is high but you get a good shoe

Like walking on a cloud Super comfortable True to size

Very comfortable soft and lightweight You can pair it your jeans and casual attire

Really comfortable runs small if you normally use 11 like me buy 11 5 The side band on one of the shoes had some scratches by the first week of use which is a shame But overall great purchase

Great for those with lower back pain I wear these shoes everywhere and for everything

Can wear all day and stylish Glad I bought Thank you adidas

They fit really well and are super comfy it is cold where I am from and they also keep my feet warm

loved it very good shoe felt really great nice shoe

Totally worth it

I really like the soft knit material the shoe is made out of

Great look and comfort Highly recommend for working out or if you are on your feet a lot for work

These are the best shoes in the world You need to buy a pair

By far my most comfortable pair of running shoes Sizing is perfect no need to up down size The materials of the upper shoe incredibly flexible yet resistant It makes it feel as if you were only wearing socks The sole delivers perfectly as all other ultraboost boost models

can not go wrong buying a white pair of Ultraboost should have sized up but I needed a pair for school These will do

the shoes cause heel pain in my foot that radiates up the leg

These are great shoe I brought them for my girlfriend who is a nurse so she is on her feet all night and she loves them the comfort is amazing for all nurses this is the shoe for you

the shoe fits amazingly and the most makes it very easy and comfortable to walk around great product and colorway

These are incredibly comfortable shoes They do run about a half size too small but they feel great

I usually buy cheaper shoes but these are worth every penny

I love these light weight shoes and they are very stylish

I love the ultraboost great looking shoe very comfortable Service was great shipping was fast love adidas

it is a super comfortable shoe and I will definitely buy another pair could be a little wider of a shoe though

YOU CAN BUY THIS ULTRABOOST WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED ADIDAS PERFECTED THEIR BOOST OVER THE YEARS AND CAME UP WITH THIS PERFECT ULTRABOOST

I was astonished after lacing these bad boys up and walking around for several hours Your heel slips right into this cradled space that hugs your foot in an amazing way These shoes feel like they were made for my feet and my feet only The insane cushion they provide is something you will not understand until you put them on You will not want to take them off The fit is so forgiving as well Go with your gut on sizing and youu all be golden I wear a 10 10 1 2 and I went with a 10 1 2 no complaints whatsoever Even if I would have ordered a 10 they still would have fit perfectly The cage and lace system is genius and provides SO much stability with a knit shoe unlike the competitors I did not purchase these for work but I work for 12 13 hours a day walking and standing on nothing but concrete floors I started wearing them to work and I actually like my job more now that I have got these shoes because they take so much of the fatigue out of working I will be buying many more for different purposes I run in them as well and they still blow my mind In terms of the future of Ultra Boosts I hope to see endless color ways and a wide array of unique materials used just to maintain relevance in the style department Buy them now and youu all be thrilled you did

Best shoes ever very comfortable Web purchase was pretty simple to use

Vet comfortable and stylish It may be half a size too small for those with wider feet so keep this in mind during your purchase Other than that awesome shoe

I have never owned a pair of Ultra Boost before but when I purchased them I was so eager to receive them As soon as they came I unboxed them and tried them on No wonder everyone were calling them the next big thing and even if they are not as mainstream as they used to be I do not care because they are more than worth it I also recommend going true to size for the best fit unless you want something a bit loose at the toe front then you should go up half a size

The shoes are great I do not recommend for all day wear as the sole of your foot begins to hurt

The Adidas Boost are extremely comfortable and look great too

A great looking shoe and it is super comfy feels like walking on clouds

This shoe was perfect It was exactly what I expected and held up wonderfully

Comfy shoes for working on concrete 8 12 hours a day

I love these shoes Just be aware I found in the shoe the material holding the laces will break if you tie your shoe tight Not a big deal just need aware of it Honestly the best running shoes I have owned

I love how comfortable the shoe is you can not get better comfort for the price Not a paid reviewer

Sizing is off A little tight at toe Could be wider

its very comfortable and very breathable and its a great overall performance shoes

The iridescent heelcup with the Cotten candy laces make the shoe really stand out when you wear them

Love the shoe very comfortable I would recommend it to everyone

Environment friendly Stylish Comfortable ultrboost Feels a little uncomfortable in one foot Maybe it have to be broken into

The best performance shoe out there Worth the money

Its a very nice shoe I own 4 pairs of ultra boosts and they are all great

Very comfortable durable and well made The colors are awesome and they are super cool

Great shoes Have them for the entire family Highly recommend

This is my fourth pair of ultra boost Why do I comeback for another pairBecause they are awesome I use this pair strictly for running and they rock My retired pair had around 500 miles and it was time to say goodbye can not wait for cold weather to break so I put these through the ringer thank you Adidas

Comfortable fashionable and can not beat the price I bought them for

it is really comfortable I love it I wear them everywhere i go

The UltraBoost is true to fit and by far the most comfortable shoe

These are the most comfortable shoes I have wore but they have gotten dirty so I recommend Crep Protect

Great look unmatched fit and finish and the killer ultra boost feel love them

I liked this product because it fits exactly my size and provides very confortable walking and running sessions

The shoes are comfortable and they feel very durable My only issue with the shoe is that they do not have a tongue so it feels like my foot will come out of the shoe but it doesnt actually because the laces do secure my foot tightly enough weird feeling The shoes also have that adidas style that i enjoy ON A SIDE NOTE if you have a dog that sheds the soles are a magnet to the hair

Comfort The ultra boost is one of the best adidas shoes ever made

The shoes look very nicee but are probably the most uncomfortable I have ever had Way too narrow Ugh so disappointed since I had heard great things

The Adidas Ultra Boost has always been a popular choice for sneakerheads amateurs and runners This shoe continues to impress with its perfect materials and construction The primeknit is really comfortable and the boost provides exceptional cushioning The Continental rubber outsole is the finishing touch providing excellent traction on almost every type of surface except for basketball courts I would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone except people with wide feet It is totally worth that money

Running walking or sleeping Ultraboost are the way to go

Very comfortable shoe Just make sure to get half a size bigger than your usual size

Great shoe but wish I went a 1 2 size up They are definitely more comfortable than what is offered by their competition Highly recommend these shoes for running and casual use

The shoe is good quality and durable but definitely order one or even two sizes up it runs small

Very comfortable shoe i will buy another pair A must have shoe

They fit my foot well they feel secure they do not feel tight

The shoes are bought for my son He like it very much it is really comfortable

The quality seems to have gotten better This can be shown through the fact that the soles of the shoes do not come out when you take off your shoes

Bought these for my mom and she is obsessed with Ultra Boost now just like I am

To sum up this is in my opinion the most comfortable shoe ever made

I have always wanted a pair a ultraboosts and now that I have them I will def buy more pairs

Put plastic bags inside new Ultraboost to see if I can widen it a bit

I love the design how it is a white mesh on the outside with a baby blue undercover It has the comfort of ultra boost and feels like air walking Another quality buy

The shoes are really comfortable they look nice and fit nicely too

Quality weightless comfortable and good wear expensive

They look cool fit great and are perfect for track

My son is ridiculously particular about shoes and it seems we are always buying a new pair so far he has been happiest with these so thank you And they were delivered soooo quickly

Great product fits firm to foot breathes well and lightweight

I love the product because of how comfy it is and at the same how good it looks with some of my outfits

These shoes are exactly what everyone else is saying very comfortable and very stylish They provide excellent support and cushion If you do not already own them you need a pair

Thanks Great Sneaker Second pair for college student

Best shoe I have ever purchased First time Ultraboost purchase and I will never go back Will get more color ways

Super comfortable great color and fit I have wide feet in womens 7 5 Best shoe i ever had Never going to wear any other shoes only ultraboost from now on

Very comfortable shoe that has great balance Works best for long walks and runs as the support is very good

They are good but run an half size too small They are really comfortable too

the shipment is really fast and the earlier comment is really helpful because this shoe is a little bit smaller so you would better buy a half size bigger one

Very comfortable Were delivered with a stain mark on the right foot upper I did not have the time to return them prior to needing to wear them Other than that they have been perfect

The ultraboost shoes are wonderful Can wear it all day The primeknit is being sturdy and love the style True to size Adidas shipping needs to be improved

just like the ultra boost shoe the look and fit be nice if price was a little better

They are very comfortable and you can walk with them for a long time Their quality is very good and they are very expensive bur worth it

So comfortable easy to run in order half size larger

Perfect for lounge wear active and everyday lifestyle

My first all white pair were a womens 8 and I typically where a 9 but they fit perfectly they had the clear 3 stripes and got super dirty tried to bleach them and they turned yellow Had them for well over a year

The sneakers are comfortable But the heel cup and adidas cage scratches easily

Would recommend for a person to buy because it is an amazing shoe that is comfortable and is worth to pay the price

Several reviewers voiced concern over Ultraboost shoes either being too small too narrow or both Many have suggested going up at least 1 2 size I disagree I have dozens of Adidas shoes in my collection and have been a long time customer of Adidas com I digested the chatter however and purchased both a size 12 5 my usual size and size 13 Going up 1 2 size was totally unnecessary for me as my usual size 12 5 fit perfectly No complaints Ultraboost are most comfortable athletic shoes I now own I would be curious as to whether or not those reviewers who voiced complaint on size or width are regular Adidas customers or new to the brand

This is a purchase well worth it Running shoe technology taken to another level

They look great and feel amazing i love these shoe Gunu buy a few more pairs

Style and fit was exactly what I was hoping for from adidas

I love these shoes and the color way I am considering getting a second pair

Very comfortable and it is a true fit I like the look and feel of the shoe

Had to order a whole size up for the shoe to fit But extremely comfortable

I disliked the style of the shoes at first but I saw some in real life and instantly was in aw I ordered them online and they fit true to size and I am not kidding when I say these are seriously one of the BEST pairs of shoes I have ever worn they are stylish durable and comfy for walking standing all day

they were a grand purchase the shoes are very comfortable

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I own Definitely will be getting some more

Love boost tech but the sock liner was not the best for my foot Recent nerve pain makes the ultra boost a little uncomfortable

I like the style and the comfort the shoe gives me

I bought these for my grandson and he thinks they are awesome

I do not run in them but they are are insanely comfortable throughout the day

Such good shoes that I would recommend to anyone looking for amazing comfort

Bought a pair for both of my sons ages 19 and 27 and they stated the shoes are very light and comfortable Good well made shoe and great for running

Great Quality and Stylish Boost family are the best

it is comfortable I like walking on clouds they look good

Ultraboosts are immediately comfortable and even better as you break them in My favorite shoe so far

As an avid shoe collector for the past 20 years you will not find a better quality shoes for comfort I find myself not gravitating towards anything adidas puts out compares to other brands Highly recommended

Entry point is too narrow can not get my foot in the sneaker

This shoe is very comfortable totally reccomend it

Hesitant to buy these at first but glad I did Really comfortable shoes

AAAAAA

Great for exercise I love these shoes for running

it is extremely comfortable and looks good on foot

Cool color super comfortable shoes that breathe very well

Quality is amazing Shoes are comfortable and offer great support

Very comfortable but they run a little small Would recommend get a half size larger than you normally would

Way too small Need to order one full size up Very disappointed that Adidas can be so misleading on the sizing

The white is so clean and the shoe is incredibly comfortable I want more

Very comfy that go great with everything Feels like your walking on clouds every step

These shoes are a perfect fit and are crazy comfortable Will definitely be buying other colors

Super comfy stylish and fits with a lot of outfits

I like them because they are quiet and they look cool

I could not be more pleased This is my third pair of boosts The only shoe that lasts for more than a year on hospital floors day in and day out

pretty comfortable shoes feels great once broken into for my running

Comfort and value

Probably the most comfortable shoes I have put on my feet in a long time and it looks cool

They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had

A gift for my sister Sick shoes The gray color looks clean it goes with everything

I purchased due to the unique color of the fabric Super comfortable

I love these super fresh all whites So comfortable I can not take them off

Not true to normal size Opening of shoe too small to easily put the shoe on

The shoe is highly comfterble and easy to slip on and really worth the price and I am definatly going to buy another pair in the future

Omg these shoes are the most comfortable pair of running shoes ever

The shoes seem run a half size smaller since it is a narrow shoe However extremely comfortable

Very comfortable and worth the money Would buy again

they are so comfortable Recommend to everyone

First of all I love the design it is very light weigh it goes well with pretty much every outfit I wear and my entire family owns a pair

I love the comfort on this shoe it is the best thing to ever touch my feet

The midsole is the best technology on the sneaker market right now and the upper is streatchy and very breathable The ankle padding is insanely soft improved from the previous ultra boost its a shoe that when you wear it you do not want to take it off that is how comfortable the Adidas Ultra Boost 4 0 actually is

My son loves these shoes and is happy with his purchase He says they are very comfortable and supportive They do run about a 1 2 size too small We will see if the toes wear out the tips over time

Footwear is light yet durable Best all around workout running shoe to date

Most comfortable shoe I have bought I wear them almost everyday cause they are stylish and feel really nice

Simple yet very pleasing to the eye but so comfortable and can wear with anything

I love it because the boost conforms to my feet when I walk but the boost gets very dirty

I love the way the shoes look fit and feel when wearing them

Wore them out significantly on first two runs unfortunately

These are really the best shoes ever so comfortable Bought them for my brother for Christmas and he loves them

It is a good good good shoe I would recommend to my buds

How comfortable it is and the Spring back it gives when running

Everything about it was just perfect I would recommend to all my friends

The boost midsole is incredible it is soft yet responsive as advertised No worry of popping the cushioning system like the other brand The PK is light and breathable so your feet do not get as soggy after a hard workout Only gripe is that you must immediately clean the outer midsole after use so that it does not stain from the dirt dust that your shoes pick up And the price is pretty steep

Very comfortable and well cushioned run My last pair was the Adidas Ultrabounce which was a nice shoe was well However the Ultraboost is more comfortable for longer run duration

These shoes are sooo comfortable more than any other shoe I have worn

My son really likes the minds this is his second pair The style was a little narrower on him but still really loves the sneakers

Just like all UBthese are super comfy and ultra stylish I do not like the white soles these were a gift however they are a good looking shoe nonetheless

I like it because they look great and are really comfortable

Most comfortable shoe for pregame and to wear casually I do not recommend running in it though

I am a huge boost fan and love the Clima Cool style and color combination of these

This is my favorite running shoe Highly Recommend

I got my dad the black pair as a birthday gift and for Christmas he asked for the grey pair He loves them and wears them all the time He says they are some of the most comfortable shoes he has owned

ultraboost is still the most comfortable shoe and it looks great

Feels like your walking on air but a little slim on width

Another great adidas product I will be back for more

I love these shoes I bought like ten pair I can not stop

After doing research on the Ultra Boost I decided to go true to size and I am glad I did Once I got it in the mail I just could not wait to try it on The style the way it looks the way it feels is just perfect Well made top quality and hands down the most comfortable pair of sneakers I own Thank you Adidas

Exactly what I wanted The shoes are very comfortable and look great

Probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned like walking on clouds

These shoes are ridiculously comfortable I work on my feet so I need comfortable shoes that are bouncy and provide that much needed rest for my feet Like walking on pillows Not to mention how stylish they are and how many compliments I get

Another great ultraboost Love the color subtle but not boring

These Ultra Boost Mids are very comfortable and very great for mid to long runs The stabilization on these are the best part

Super comfortable and performance is top notch A must buy

Shoes are very comfortable and are very light Shoes are also a little narrow

have not run in these shoes yet but so far feel great for walking I was told to get a 1 2 size bigger and recommend that my toe is just about at the edge Overall great shoes I will most likely get another pair

ultra boost is great but to tight please send instructions to get larger size

I enjoyed them so much I went out and bought my wife a pair for Christmas

These are the most comfortable sneakers ever I would recommend them to anyone I have flat feet with pain and these help a lot

I had a small scuff on the back heel Took a cloth and water the scuff came off easy but so did the silver paint of the adidas boost logo Obviously discounted boosts are made poor quality do not buy

My first ultraboost and I really like it Very comfortable My feet does not hurt after hours of walking

I love this product and personally own 5 pairs throughout a span of 4 years As a running shoe i could not ask for anything more and they are stylish enough for everyday casual wear The only problem I have noticed is the boost material tends to wear easier than the rest of the shoe nothing too drastic but to be noted

as any Adidas Product it is good quality and comfortable

I like how they look and feel Very stylish but can be worn all the time I would recommend sizing up though

Superior comfort and stylish So glad that I bought these shoes

This is my 4th ultraboost and as expected I am very satisfied Comfort looks and performance The bests of all the running shoes I ever had

The first time I noticed really noticed that the ultra boost are amazing is when I took my first run in them can not even feel the ground hahahah

This was a Christmas gift for my older son he loved it shoes are very comfortable and also look great I will definitely buy another pair for my younger son I am more of a NMD type but I also liked this shoes

I love the subtle rainbow accents and the mint base color They are comfortable

Comfortable Feels like I am bouncing on clouds I woul recommend this shoe to everyone

the product so comfortable I like Adidas product

The new ultra boost runners are high quality The support provided seems improved over earlier editions Very comfortable on the street or in the gym Good looking shoes

I had to order a 1 2 size larger than normal 11 because my normal size was rubbing my small toe and was uncomfortable The shoes look great and there are no apparent manufacturing defects They feel super comfortable too

Very good fit and very comfortable when it comes to a good fitting sneaker

Love the sneaker May just be one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever purchased

Returned due to red showing through mesh near left shoe toe box and shoes were too small

Super comfortable The mid wraps around your foot like a sock Being thicker than normal I would say they are more like cabin socks Super comfortable Fits snug so definitely half size up

Favorite shoes ever they are my first pair of adidas and i love them Only problem is the cages scratch easy

Ultraboosts are very stylish yet so comfortable breathable and light for your feet

Stylish made well good color selection fit good comfortable

Parleys have a different feel than regular boost regardless get 1 2 size up if you have wide feet Great color

A very comfortable pair of shoes yet still looks stylish I have received great comments about the style

Always good Never bad Keep it real Makes me glad

The shoe is very comfortable they came in fast and they also look really nice

These are the modt comfortable shoes I have ever worn I can walk all day and still be comfortable Very high quality product that I would recomend to anyone

By far the best neutral running shoe I have ran in this far Owned several pair and will continue to purchase

good price and quality got this item as a gift and the end user really likes them

3rd pair in 2 years Love them Works great with my plantar fasciatis and ankle issues

Highly recommend

I really like the color on these shoes can not forget about the comfort and support these give you

The product is exactly what I wanted and was looking for

This is my third pair of Ultra Boost shoes Good workout shoe

Fits comfortablly and goes with anything you wear

Wonder shoes for plantarfaciatis and my back Highly recommend

Ultraboost is an exceptional footwear probably the only pair of shoes I will ever wear

Great product shoes are extremely comfortable Definitely will buy again

Love the shoes because of color comfort look of the shoe and fit

This was not the first pair of Ultraboost that we have Overall fitment and comfort Quality of material is above par Looking forward to enjoying this pair

This shoe runs true to size Upper part of shoe feels great

Upon receiving this pair of UltraBoostfirst thing I did was give one shoe a toe bend test And after that toe bend test I began to feel as is the fused paneling making the mudguard may not withstand the test of time And for that reason I was not pleased with this pair I do not believe the PK upper will tear under these conditions the way a less premium mesh or textile may However I do fear that the design of the mudguard shape will eventually fail Which over time may lead to unnatural creasing crackingor tearing at that bending point of the lateral sides of each shoe And because of that I had to return this pair

Ultraboost is really comfy and stylish I currently have 4 and want more

the product is great and the comfort is on point as always adidas do great and brand is always doing good

The ultraboost has become my everyday shoe from the first time I have first put them on Nothing compares in terms of both comfort and looks

If you purchase a size up because they fit too narrow the next size up will be too big

Very comfortable would definitely order again Greatproduct

Goes well with my athletic shorts can not wait to order another pair

You always know what you are getting Ultraboost Very comfortable

Nice color

Comfortable and high quality They are a little snug for me

I like the style and comfort plus it is true to size

Great all around product that is very versatile for casual wear and also for running The price is a bit high but if your looking for a sneaker you can wear and feel like you are walking on clouds This is exactly what you are looking for

Softest most comfortable shoe ever made well next 2 the nmd

Excellent shoes Highly recommend I have a pair in black and in white

Too small would like to return them for a large size or refund

They look good and feel comfortable that is all I have to say

Same great shoes that are helping support a great cause

Ultraboostare my favorite shoes I have ever owned

Just run a little small but awesome shoes Like walking on clouds

There are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn hands down Also great quality Worth the purchase

Get at the very least a half size up These shoes are extremely comfortable but they are also very snug Great pair of everyday shoes

Extremely comfortable shoe and fits to perfection

I have had these shoes stolen twice and keep coming back to buy them since they are so good

The sole and the boost is very comfortable Can be worn in many occasions

Got these as a Christmas gift from my brother and they are amazing They do feel noticeably different than the shoes that I usually wear but they are definitely comfortable and pair nicely with many of my outfits I am very happy to have received this as a gift

Comfortable durable and looks great 10 10 would buy again

Have had 4 of these shoes and all were different in regards to size I had to return 2 of the 4 because they were too tight Tried ordering my true size 9 5 and 5 up in a 10 Ended up keeping the 10s but definitely does not feel like a 10 size I expcected more on quality control given the price but was wrong

Got these for my son for Christmas he loves them I would definitely recommend

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I highly recommend this shoe

Great everyday shoes very comfortable to walk around in

very good quality and extremely comfortable size up at least 5

Great when you are on your feet all day Great for running as well

Real nice and comfortable Will recommend it to my family members and friends

This is my sonsecond pair of ultraboosts and he absolutely loves them Super comfortable great style Keep up the great work

Made super well and hold up The quality is there for the price you pay

Love the contrasting heel cup and cage and the Parley c and aign promises

The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I would definitely recommend them

Most comfy shoe ever hard to wear other shoes now that my feet are spoiled Not only are they comfortable but are stylish too A shoe you can wear for running or just lifestyle Recommend to go half size up as they run small

Feels like your walking on air Great comfort would reccomend

Feel great now and love the style would recommend to others

The prime knit and boost make this my favorite shoe

One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn only bested by the Yeezy V2 Will feel a bit tight out of the box but primeknit loosens to fit your feet perfectly True to size

Comfortable sneakers which can be worn to the gym or paired with jeans khakis Fit true to size feet feel they are wrapped in pillows

super comfortable and looks amazing great shoe all around

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes ever made

A little snug but overall great shoe I recommend half size bigger

Ultraboost is if not one of the most comfortable sneakers I ever wore

Received thee sneakers as a gift They are very comfortable and lightweight Great for running

Hands down the most comfortable shoe I have worn to date They have that original pinholes knit pattern of the ultra boost 1s around the toe and better breathing holes knitted into the top Great shoe my first pair of many

Very good product well made would recommend purchase

I like boost cushioning Please make a more solid insole that does not fold and come out when taking the shoes off

I bought this shoes for a son He has not taken them off since he got them

Got these for my dad who is on his feet all day They are very comfortable and soft His only complaint was that they were a little narrow

It is insanely stylish and comfortable while also perfectly fitting your foot

I really love the look of the product but I put comfort before everything and I am not that appreciative of them for that

UBs are the most comfortable sneakers on the market and contrary to what you might think about the sock part of the sneaker the give you better support and keep your feet warm in cold weather

Very comfortable shoe to wear on as a daily Highly recommend any ultra boost

Please make these shoes in wide and extra wide sizes

Fit is perfect though with the ultra boost I have to go a half size bigger than in the nmd 

Adidas signature running shoe is certainly top of the line and absolutely worth it is value UltraBoost is maximum comfort and offers support and stability even for those who are not frequent runners Triple white easily makes it my favorite colorway

I bought these as a gift I am told they are super comfortable and fit perfect

These shoes are very comfortable and they fit perfect

These shoes are versatile and go with many things

You can not go wrong with the ultraboost I did find this type to be slightly tight around the ankle area It could be due to the finish on the upper But compared to the other ultraboost I have had sizing wise this was color way was different

My family and I are very environmental but i just didnt like the way it looked on me though but great shoe and i love Adidas

This is my fourth UltraBoost purchased and I have to say that it definitely the best so far The colors in this shoe are great and the shoe itself feels amazing

Most comfortable shoe ever I would definitely recommend I purchased them for Christmas and I have not stopped wearing them

Theses are the most comfortable shoes and the fit is perfect

Waited way to long to buy my first pair of Ultra Boost They have exceeeded my expectations No doubt it will become a favorite shoe in my rotation

The ultra boosts are simple and nice looking true to size and most importantly comfy

The comfort level of the shoe is off the charts The gold and black colorway works well with black tracksuit

Nice to be able to help reduce plastics in the ocean The shoe comes up a little tight so had to send it back and then my was sold out so missed out but in the time I had them the shoe was very comfortable

As long as you get a half size up you are gonna be the happiest person in the world

Sized up 1 2 from my normal size and they fit pretty well just slightly long in the toebox My normal size felt a little tight Overall a great shoe

Most comfortable shoe on the market Worth every penny

Good product for the price Great style very comfortable

For size they fit perfectly completely flexible for the foot Great material used for looks Came out better than I expected

Great shoes and you cannot go with the Adidas BoostVery comfortable and all around great quality

very comfortable stylish beautiful would wear this everyday

I like them because they are so comfortable and fit perfectly

I like the parley from trash to fad very comfortable

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned This is my 3rd pair of UB Will be getting another pair

Great shoes and good quality The primeknit is a little tight so maybe go up a half size up on these bad boys

Most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned I have since bought 10 more pair

Most comfortable running shoe on the market I have ever purchased in all my life Highly recommend to whoever have doubt in ordering Fits true to size

looks cool and comfortable definitely made waves in the game

They are really comfy and stylish I also loved the way they fit

These are great running and casual shoes could wear them all day

Comfortable shoes and look good in person as well

This shoe is extremely comfortable and lightweight The only downside is that even with scotchguarding and daily cleaning it is impossible to keep this shoe clean due to the fabric upper not being made stain or dirt resistant by the manufacturer

I found these granite ultra boost mids to be a great addition to my collection They fit true to size and have a great balance of white grey and blue to bring out a very wintery vibe What you can not tell from the pictures is how vibrant the heel cup is it is truly pearlescent Additionally the primeknit has some nice sparkles glitter throughout that really elevate the aesthetic of the upper and capture the sense you are looking at a piece of granite The rope laces add a very nice premium touch to these mids

Almost everything is perfect except size is a little large and because they are a good looking shoe and white I do not want to get them dirty White was only avilible

Very comfortable light weight and is causal enough to wear with anything

It was a good show highly recommend If bought they are are good for running and simple style

it was so clean looking but wearing it outdoor acrually make me forget about lool because i was enjoying walking on the cloud

This is my 2nd pair of UBs and these shoes will forever be my go to shoes for my active lifestyle and even fashion as well

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Comfortable durable and stylish

it is comfortable and easy to wear for everyday the quality is good and it fits well on my feet

Would recommend this shoe just off the comfort and the design is very nice

Very comfortable shoesHighly recommendedWill definitely get other colorway

The shoes are really great they are great for running as well as everyday wear

These in hand are beautiful and so comfortable can not go wrong

I love it very nice and comfortable looks great quality

these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Start to break in front after just having for a few weeks No sure if material had a defect

i love the product i wear them with jeans casual pants or to play golf they are comfortable and great looking and when i wear his pair out i am buying another pair

The fit was on point I also work in my boost

I absolutely love the Ultraboost mids From the comfort to the color way it reminds me of sweater knit I was sold I immediately wanted to buy another color

The Ultra Boot is worth the money expensive but so comfortable that I have not worn another shoe since I received them 2 weeks ago It is like walking on a cloud so soft

These shoes have changed the way I look at shoes before I purchase them

shoes do fit snug as other reviews say but it is a very comfortable snug Love the blue dye and love getting to talk about Adidas environmental efforts when I wear them

Its size is bigger than other but it is really comfortable

Quality even after several washes the treads are worn but the shoe is still in pretty good shape

I will buy this shoe until they stop making them They fit perfectly feel amazing for running and walking and are stylish enough to wear for many occasions

I love this product because there are so many ways to wear it They also provide great comfort and support and they do not wear out quickly They sometimes hurt the arch of my foot but that may be due to me tying them too tightly Overall a great shoe

Great color way for this shoe Ultra Boost is the bear shoe ever made

It looks and feels so good I am thinking of getting another Ultraboost for training and not to ruin this one

I love the color and the shoes are very comfortable

Very comfortable especially for life style wear although lacks lateral support which is frustrating for working out

The Boost is great comfortable works well with low cut joggers

Fits just right boost is comfortable looks great with cuffed joggers

Nothing much to say but boost is life I have heard to go half size down but I went true to size and it fits like a glove

I give it a 4 out of 5

I have multiple pairs of ultra boost Will definitely buy more

The heal came apart the first time worn Terrible quality

what is better than an UltraboostOne with two major updatesthe use of Parley which is environmentally sustainable and the added breathable the ventilation holes in the knit provide Plus these look great Always get compliments wearing these beauties and getting to raise awareness about Parley and their collaboration with adidas is a major plus

I love the looks and by far the most comfortable shoe but after wearing the shoe twice and taking the best care of them The side of the shoes kinda comes outward and is already wearing out

Boost are simply the most comfortable shoe ou there

These Ultraboosts are the most comfortable shoes I own

I love the colors and the details on this shoe The chrome and gold ultraboost logo is a cool touch

great product looks great feels great online slight downside is it was a little less stable than I was expecting Great for me for walking around but would not be supportive enough for running

Very comfortable shoes that have a slightly tight fit at first but after a couple of wears the shoe should stretch out and fit snug like a sock

I have three pairs of ultraboosts and they never fail to impress me

Very comfortable and soft Excellent aesthetic and very mobile

These are my favorite shoes They are the sharpest fashion statement for sports shoes I get great compliments

They sent me used shoes with the tags ripped off stains on the shoes and no paper in the shoes the way brand new shoes usually come

I rarely buy shoes besides black or white but this one is exception

These are the best looking and best feeling shoes

The color but the sizeing runs small but overall the rest is all good

good shoe to run in comfortable slight sizing issue as I had to size down from my normal shoe size

I think for comfort there is not another shoe that can compete with this one

I feel like I am walking on a cloud This is all I wear anymore I am wearing them with my tuxedo for New Years

I have worn these almost every day since I got them because they are so comfortable they are slightly tight when you first get them but loosen up super quick Honestly could not ask for much more

5 star chick and my main squeeze now cant get enough of them

Really comfortable and great styling free runner no problem on dressing up or down with these shoes boost midsole is awesome by itself already but with the primeknit made these by far the best you can get with a boost model fitment is true to size and I have a wide feet Highly recommended

I like it but I wouldnt have bought it if it was not for the Black Friday deal

Good and comfy but too narrow Ordered a size up

They feel a little loose and I think that is because the width is a little wide

It creates so many new outfits and I needed white shoes

Most comforotable shoe period This is my 10th pair

LOVE Adidas this shoe is a little snug but wearable but cool as can be

Very comfortable but not as soft as the climas Do get 1 2 size up They run small

Best walking shoe for me hands down I love the material craftsmanship

Honestly the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I love the style and comfort you get out of this shoe took them to Disney land for a whole day of walking and at the end of the day my feet felt perfectly fine

The color way is amazing and they are the most comfortable shoes ever

This shoe provides comfort for me through the day

Good looking and comfortable Favorite shoe I have gotten in a while

These are really nice looking shoes that you can dress up or down They are also super comfortable to wear Not sure yet about how they are in long distance running but they are at least a good casual shoe

These are just as great as the regular ultraboost but with a special cause Fit and style is excellent

I like the design of the shoes as well as the comfortablility

do not fit right I would like to return them My right foot rubs against my left foot

I have been waiting for a pair of multi colored UltraBoost 4 0 all year and was very excited when I saw these pop up however I was very disappointed when I saw them in person because the colors are so dull that the shoes look black and white on feet I returned them and will continue to wait for a decent multi color 4 0

I have been a fan of ultra boost This new black color way looks interesting and nice Good quality and very comfortable I would like to see more Parley version of ultra boost

Honestly has great support so my feet are not sore while at work However even with slim feet like mine it is snug after a week of breaking them in it be way to slim for people with wider feet I normally wear 8 5 in other brands to give myself a little bit of toe room for comfortability but this one runs a little smaller and my toe reaches the very end Overall great comfort but a little fine tuning on the sizing should be considered

This is hands down the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn You will not regret your purchase

The shoes have the high level of comfort and quality

That shoes are great and all but just a little tight

Comfy and light have not worn any other shoe since

I bought these for my dad and they are now his daily beaters You can not go wrong with Boost

Comfortable and fire I got good deal on black Friday

These shoes really strike a balance between comfort and support The knit looks great and they are comfortable These are not a hardcore trail running shoes by any means but I use these for the gym and very short easy runs The only issue that may pop up for some is the placing of the rubberized parts on the arch side and up towards the ball of the foot This is always tricky with these types of shoes but these work for me

My grandson loves these shoesthese are his second pair

I bought them yesterday and they are wonderful they are very comfortable light fresh recommended for all runners I am going to buy more styles

Shoes are very comfortable but remember to purchase one size larger than usual

comfortable and stylish very good for walking and running

They are extremely comfortable it is like walking on a cloud

Extremely comfortable shoes Appear to be quite durable I am 65 270 lbs and I love them

The Ultraboost is a comfortable shoe in general plus this specific shoe I really liked the color way

You really can not beat the Ultraboost for casual comfort and everyday wear Stylish and good looking shoe True to size for me

Giving these as a gift so while I do not know what he will think of them I know that I am very jealous and want a pair for myself now

Overall these are my favourite shoes I wear them all the time They are super comfortable and they fit perfectly I will be getting another pair soon

okay it is a good shoe and it is comfortable

great style and comfort I get complements on my shoes from other people

very comfortable I like the look of the shoes

Love the color wave Size as expected one of my faves

Most comfortable shoes ever Feels like walking on clouds

First time buying an adidas shoe ever and I used the adidas fit guide Awesome awesome shoe and would buy another pair Recommend for an weekend getter all around comfort shoe

If you are looking to by this shoe I would get a half size up from normal Other than that this shoe is extremely comfortable

Its a great pair of shoes They are comfortable and light Feels like walking on clouds I like the look of them Wore them now for about two weeks and no sore feet or discomfort Im a size 9 and they recommend ordering a half size up which I did They fit great though I think you can be just as okay with a 9 Reason for 4 stars is that at times when take off shoes the pad inside shoes comes off easily which is inconvenient but nothing major Overall would buy again Great pair of workout shoes

Great shoe A little tight at first Great colorway

Anything to help the oceans Consider buying half a size up as they come in a little tight

The shoes look great and feel great its just annoying how everytime I take them off the insoles come out with my footon both pairs I own If the insoles were secured or at least designed to stay in theyd really be the perfect shoes

The ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe I have ever tryed on They are very breathable and have lots of grip and stability They are super easy to slip on and off ConsI take extsermely good care of my shoes I have noticed that the heel cups and cage could get scuffed or scratched very easily and same for the boost mid sole Not on my pair but others the contenential rubber on the outsole wears down and bottoms out but I pretucularly does not have this problem Another thing is that there is lots of glue marks and stains on the shoe All along the bottoms of the fly kit upper or where the top of the boost midsole meets the upper There are also glue marks on the connection of the plastic cage and the heel cup where the midsole connects On pair when I got them there was glue marks across the heel cup but I easily just scratched it off with my finger The boost midsole is really durable as for the same as the fly kit upper and overall the whole shoe Be carful when wearing with jeans and contact with water One of the colorways I purchased was the triple white and some of the dye from the jeans dripped onto the tounge with slite tint of blue but not notice able Over all great shoe and really recommend

Very comfortable and sleek shoes I have received severa compliments about the look of them already

The squishy soles are amazing fit is perfect Great shoe for working out or hanging out

The shoes are very comfortable and stylish They are excellent to run and workout in Only problem with them is the sides of the white soles stained green when I ran through grass I cannot get them clean

This shoes are amazingly comfortable I would totally recomend this shoes for people that suffer from knee pain This shoe is literally like walking on clouds

Very very comfortable shoe Very light and breathable

Comfortable Stylish etc

Nothing compares to the comfort these shoes provide

The fit is smaller I had to size up from what I usually get I personally LOVED the 3 0 with continental rubber I just recently threw them out after having them for years and bought these for a replacement and I am disappointed Bring those back please

My friends Pam and Jeff extolled the comfort of these shoes and I just dismissed their recommendations as hype When another shoe company used a quarterback for one of their ads they lost my business I came to Adidas looking for a super comfortable shoe and that is what I got with the Ultraboost Truly a great shoe

I like this shoe mainly because of how extremely comfortable it is I work long days on my feet and at the end of them wearing these shoes I axperiance no foot pain It also is environmentally friendly with the collaboration with Parley

I love this model and ultraboost is the best The all black is dope

Purchased for a girl friend of mine and she is a size 8 and purchased size 9 am for her and it fits perfectly

I really like the mid ultra boosts a ton they are really comfy and fit perfect I decently recommend them

I use these shoes for running to play handball and to walk around They are good quality and very comfortable

I liked the color of this shoe but the way it fit on me felt weird It felt a tad small but also a tad unlike the other shoes when it comes to comfort

Love the comfort Nice colorway but do definitely get a half size up your current size because they run small

Way too comfortable I wear this literally everywhere

Extremely Comfortable and runs perfectly Matches every outfit

it is literally the most comfortable pair of tennis shoes I own

The hype is real There is no shoe more comfortable than the Adidas ultraboost I was so impressed with how comfortable they were I had to go back and buy 3 other pairs to gift friends and family just so they could understand HOW GOOOD THEY ARE

Good quality shoe but want more cushion under the sole

Had to return got wrong color thought shoe was Collegiate blue

Comfort design and fit I will be back for another pair

I have been running for over 10 years and collecting sneakers for 2 years now and I can say with confidence these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever used I am fortunate to own 2 pairs of NMDs and some Yeezy 350s all of which use Boost technology and these are the best of the bunch Definitely planning on buying more in the future and have already converted most of my family to loving these shoes

I love the ultraboost because they are the most comfortable shoe ever

Very clean ultraboost Colorway goes with anything

One of the best color ways to date Perfect true to size fit

nice fit fits well great running shoe price ok 1

ultra boost are really the most comfortable shoe around

I usually wear a size 11 in most shoes but I had to size down to a 10 5 in these the comfort level is incredible and I wore this shoe all day everyday with no complaints

A very and highly recommended shoe for people looking for cushioned wth great price

Style and comfort Price could be cheaper on the other hand since they are for a growing boy who grows out of them fast

The shoes are extremely comfortable they fit great primeknit upper hugs your feet really well and keeps them in place

I like the discount provided and the fast delivery I would highly recommend these shoes due to the comfort

Bought for my son The shoes fit well but are a little more narrow than other options My son says they are the most comfortable running shoe he has tried but the price is steep which is why I can only give these 4 stars instead of 5

One of the best shoes that adidas has released You can not go wrong with this shoe

I have been wearing them for less than a month and they just suddenly started to squeak like a rusty door Unbelievable that I paid this much and I do not even want to wear them anymore

Extreme comfort great look and phenomenal style This is a MUST COP for anyone who loves shoes

Very comfortable material and soles Very light and smooth to run in

it is good and it do not suck so buy it unless you a bum

I love the look and feel of these shoes on my feet they are very comfortably although I did have to go half a size up because I have wide feet Overall it is a really versatile shoe that you can wear with pretty much anything

My favorite shoes from adidas so far Very comfortable and goes with everything

I have several pairs of ultra boost this pair feels the best on feet very snug and comfortable

Fits my foot comfort and support plus great look

a litter tight but still very comfortable Color is also cool

I wear these everyday They go with most everything and they look amazing These are easily the most well received non flashy shoes I own People of all ages comment about them and the UB 4 is so soft and comfy Get yourrself a pair before you can not anymore

They run a little tight so I can not wear thick socks but other than that I like them a lot just wish I would have gone up a half size

Nice looking and feels good I wish they were less expensive

These are probably one of my favorite pair of Boost Love the nit comfort and design After the first day I wore them I thought dang I want to wear these everyday Easy to put on and off The boost feel is just incredible to someone like myself with plantar fasciitis Adidas you have saved my life

I love the style and fit best runner ever with great cushion

Super comfortable and look great There is a small defect on one of the uppers that is barely noticed I am so happy with the shoes I already ordered a custom pair

The most comfortable pair of shoes that I have ever owned

Best mid top Ultra to date I gotta have the other colors

This shoe is amazing I got it at one of their stores and I never regretted the decision It fits so well around the ankle Definitely recommend it

did not like color but was comfortable but my other UB all terrain way better

It fits perfectly around my feet and is very comfortable plus it goes great with casual fits

Ultraboost is my favorite adidas I am a BIG fan of Parley and have bought almost all SKU of Parley Ultraboost This color combo is wonderful and very cool for the summer

Feels comfortable while walking running doing anything that requires your feet really

Awesome colab with Parley again Love the color way and breathable PK The perfect UB to wear when going to the beach

Honestly ultra boost is such a distinct feeling that I highly recommend they are so comfortable and light

Bought this awhile back and just getting around to give my review Have a lot of boost pairs UB NMD R1 NMD R2 PUREBOOST 350 V2 NMD CS2 and not getting tired of getting more pairs What can I say BOOST is LIFE and it is very comfortable

ive had the navy colored supernovas and they were super comfortable over all I think ultraboosts are my favorite and the best running shoe on the market THANKS ADIDAS

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

These seem to be great for a lot of people I tried them on when they first arrived and found them tighter than I would expected Wore them out for the day By the time I got home I was experiencing a good amount of tension in my foot and ankle Some reviews say the shoe has a break in period but I think mine were just too small Returned

I like it not everything I expected but still ok I will where then

I liked the product The first shoe I had to return because was defective This one seems good

These are amazing Comfortable and light Totally recommend it

Its is simply the best styled and most comfortable shoe ever

The boost aspect makes the wearer feel like your walking on clouds Better then any other shoe I have worn prior for long walks

A good pair of trainers A little tight but will just wear thin socks

I bought this shoe a little while ago and my pair is just perfect it fits perfectly and looks amazing I hope the cushion from the boost lasts as long as my last pair of NMDwhich I bought two years ago and still wear regularly

Its super comfortable and unique Also it matches my outfits

Ultraboost are always so comfy and light weight

It is really comfortable and is a great running shoe The extra support is amazing

The UltraBoost provide a comfort that can not be matched

These shoes are extremely comfortable I use them whenever I know I am going to be walking around a lot The neutral colors make it easy to match with a lot of clothes especially whites and darker colors Worth every penny

I bought these as my fourth pair of Ultraboosts The color was what sold me It does have a bit of maroon in the knit but they look really good with khakis

Just got these and they fit like a glove they are true to size and feel great I highly recommend the adidas ultra boost you will not be disappointed it is like walking on pillows

The shoe is so comfy and it has a awesome style

I am in love with my tennis been wearing them the whole week

A bit tight on the width but other than that it is a great shoe

Great shoe that fits true to size Not a narrow shoe aside from running its a great casual shoe

The boost technology makes ultra boosts one of the most comfortable shoes out there Definitely can be on your feet all day in them Had to buy a pair for everyone in my family

These have great style look amazing and feel great on your foot

It has a snug fit that the Uncaged versions do not have Best pair of shoes I have ever owned

I bought this shoe for my freshman year of high school and now I am a junior and they still look like they are only a month old They are super comfortable and can slide on and still stay tight on you feet Best shoe you can get hands down

The Ultra Boost are literally the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They are also very durable fit perfectly and are easy to wear with pretty much any outfit Definitely recommend

Very good looking and comfortable shoes for everyday wearing and gym training

Super comfortable feels like I am walking on a cloud the quality construction does not exactly match up with the price point though

I am on my feet all day these shoes are very comfortable They also have lots of styles will definitely be purchasing more shoes

I always love to buy Parley shoes This ultraboost color looks great so I buy 2 pairs it is a ultraboost so everything else continues to be great

I am honestly not sure these are better than my pureboosts I bought which were cheaper

Absolutely love these ultra boost mids Super comfy Runs true to size

Ultraboost are the most comfortable shoe that I can dress up or go running in

Looks good feels good what else can I sayI want more

I went half a size up like recommended fit was fine a little narrow Was a little disappointed with the shoes out of the box though the cage came stained with some gold colored marks that reflected a obnoxious amount of light and the plastic heel counter looked poorly attached to the midsole The cushion was impressive as expected I would still recommend this product because of how comfy and stylish the sneakers are but it will not like blow your mind or anything

Stylein my opinion I love the parley versions of any adidas product I have been really trying to make an effort to buy and recycle products Next cop is the AM4LA just because it is a parley addition

This shoes fit very well and look great The midsole cushions wonderfully I will be buying more of these

Not only is it a great shoe to log quality miles in but it has amazing street style I have a couple colors of the Ultraboost to devote some to running and some for everyday wear

The most confortable shoe I have ever owned in my entire life

Easily the most comfortable shoe I have ever bought

I have bought a few different shoes walking in the city and walking at Disney World These are without a doubt the best option over both my nike my salomen hiking shoes and vans ultrarange You can feel the bounce in each step it almost feels like memory foam it is incredible

This is the most comfortable shoe in the world

despite uncomfortable with insole these shoes are good quality and light weight

The Ultraboost is one of the shoes that got adidas huge I really love the color and comfort that it gives Great casual shoe and sport shoe

I like this product because of it is amazing comfort

Very comfortable and fits true to size would recommend

The 3M fabric is an awesome touch I would purchase again

This is the most comfortable running shoe You walk on air on these shoes

Overall decent running shoe with decent overall quality

For its price the quality and comfort is amazing Sizing and width fit perfectly for me The boost made my feet feel like they were in sort of a box filled with cotton balls

This is a great product I like the fit and colors the most

The problem is ankle too narrow when I take a sock that feeling so bad

They are a very comfortable shoe They fit well and the ultraboost is always great Not sure how they will hold up long term or when i go to clean them though

the cage gets scratched way to easy the crevises of the bost gets dirt in them and does not come out

fast shipping super comfy and over all great quality

This purchase was money well spent GO UP HALF A SIZE

These sneakers are stylish and the color is very nice

Very comfortable and I really enjoy the texture and feel of the shoe when running

I think I need another pair to give a better review

The shoes are really comfortable It looks great with joggers or jeans

This product is very comfortable and fits my day to day need

This is a good shoe However it is a pain to get my feet in there the attached tongue makes it incredibly hard to wear it Also due to the same reason the insole comes out everytime I take off the shoe The place is very thin and keeps getting untied so have to stop and tie it again Extremely comfortable but these points need to be addressed

I wanted to really really like these shoes but they are just a little tight I picked my usual size but they are juuuuust a little snug Size up and I would be swimming in them do not get me wrong I like them but I just do not love them like some of my other Adidas joints

Really comfortable shoes I use them for work for the weekends and working out An all in one that you can not go wrong with

Although they get dirty very easily they look great The boost is nice and is great for running

A runner for years and a huge Ultraboost fan A clean and neutral colorway to add to my sneakers running and streetwear rotation Keep up the great work adidas

Very comfortable very nice looking high quality and very light shoes

I like how they fit and its true to size and its a light shoes Perfect for walking or standing for a long period of time

Comfortable and made well This is my second pair

Although they ran smaller than expected they are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever tried

This is my second pair of Ultraboost and i am just happy with the quality of these shoes

The most comfortable sneaker I have purchased and looks great on feet Love it

They are very comforatble and for to the foot very well

I like the product because of how comfortable the shoe is and how versatile ultra boosts are

Never bought Adidas prior was never really a fan but i finally tried on a pair of Ultra Boost and changed how I feel on your products the amount of comfort I felt was incredible

Got my buddy his first pair of ultra boost and he loves them Went with all white so it could go with everything Highly recommend to anyone looking for a durable and comfortable running shoe

Love the comfort and fit of these Ultra Boost 4 0s

coming from the 2 0 this updated version has a tighter knitted upper and a cleaner colorway the ankle collar feels more padded which is always a plus

No matter how many reviews you read telling you they are true to size ignore that They are half a size too small The End You will thank me once you remove them off your feet and your feet are not burning from excruciating pain due to a super snug tight fit

Product arrived in perfect condition and looked amazing While standing in this shoe all day this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Comfortable and lite weight I have narrow feet so the fit was perfect for me

Mu son loved them They fit perfectly and are very comfortable

As comfortable as you would expect from an UltraBoost and a beautiful colorway

really nice shoe comfortable and worth the money i spent on them 8 5 10

Only problem it was not the right size for me other than that it was perfect

I currently wear this shoes and another NMD you can significantly feel the difference This one fit wonderfully like it is designed for my feet The one I purchased looks kinda greyish from far but the color is actually very vivid looking closely Overall I consider this to be the best sneaker I bought in the last few years

These shoes are great to run long distances in They are very lightweight and are very comfortable My favorite running shoe to date

This shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes ever

Ultrboosts are my preferred running shoes for years and I buy many pairs a year They were always one size bigger than my number and I remember seeing reviews recommending to buy one size down for a good fit for running This time though they seem to be at size so my shoes are now feeling a little tighter than it used to be Other than that they are my perfect running shoes after running for 37 years

I needed some good shoes but also comfortable since I walk A LOT these shoes are amazing and worth the money Make sure you order the correct size because these are differently than other shoes I normally wear a 9 5 or 10 BUT in these I am an 11 Definitely will be sticking with Adidas

These new ultraboost are extremely comfortable and stylish I can wear them with almost everything

This is my 1st pair of ultraboosts and I will definitely be buying more pairs they are super comfortable and they are some of the best looking shoes you can buy and the parley colorways are also for a good cause

I have said it before and I will say it again The Ultraboosts are super comfortable And these Hi Res blue silhouettes are just so nice looking I am in the process of slowly but surely replacing all of my old shoes with Ultraboosts

Good style Superior comfort Looking forward to new colorways and shoe designs

Essentially ticks off all the boxesthe only complaint is how easy it stainsbut that is inherent in white shoes

The upgraded version from the previous one really love the sole

This shoe is amazing Super comfy your walking on clouds definitely recommend and will be buying again

Get these shoes because they are worth every penny

really nice fit if you have narrow feet recommend to everyone with narrow feet

A great shoe for running or just wearing while you are out and about it is very comfy and not too flashy it is a unique and functional shoe

This product is incredibly comfortable I have worn huaraches roshes and a few jumpman shoes for years but these shoes will be the only shoes I purchase from here on out The boost cushion support is the first noticeable feature the moment after putting the shoe on and taking your very first step Buy these shoes Worth the money

Very impressed with this shoe Extremely comfortable and a perfect fit

The sneakers are comfortable soft on the heel provide great stability for runners

Comfort and style all in one Best version of the Ultraboost Take the prime knit of a NMD and puts in on a Ultraboost that is what you have here

it is comfortable fits like a sock goes with about anything I wear and positive impact on environment too

Great shoe and very comfortable when I am on the go

Not near enough cushioning Lots of foot and leg pain after use Innersole was of no value So thin to be totally of no value Way overpriced did not sense any torsion in the Torsion System Heel sort of okay but sole not even close Very disappointing

By far the most comfortable sneaker I have ever worn Fits and looks fantastic Well worth the price if you are able to find the shoe in stock

It is a very comfortable shoe and the fit is perfect

I bought the shoes for my grandson he has 17 they only worn to school for a couple of weeks The sole of the shoe has separated We have used super glue to try to make them wearable 180 00 was a lot

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I HIGHLY recommend them

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and great style

This specific shoe model is one to live for literally I would recommend this shoe to every single person It is really comfortable the colors are really well mixed and also it can last a long time

This is my first pair of Parleys and I could not be happier I have a few pairs of Ultraboosts that are size 12 and I got these in 11 5 and they fit perfect Love the color of the shoes

Great shoe comfy Past experience is they do stretch out loose some shape after awhile

I am a repeat customer for this light sturdy shoe Only slight criticism from previous pairs is that after some use insoles come loose when you remove foot from shoe Everything else holds up excellently in daily use

it is soft and cushiony sole leaves my feel sleep too well Shape and size is perfect

The shoe comfort is really off the charts the boost is incredibly cushioning and the knit feels like a sock but not loose Adidas really has perfected this shoe the looks are incredible but not extravagant and the comfort is incredible I have worn these almost every day since I got them and find any excuse I get to put them on They also make so many outfits perfect as they are such a great overall shoe I can not think of any shoe that can work with both a flannel and also as a running exercise shoe it is worth your money trust me

Absolutely love the fit I do not normally like to purchase online but the Adidas Ultra Boost are a great shoe Best fit and support that I have experianced

Great for running and everyday life they look and feel great

THE perfect summer shoe Comfortable airy and good looking Plus it is got an eco friendly vibe

These shoes are the most comfortable things that I have worn They are even more comfortable than adidas yeezy boost 350 v2 They do run a bit small so I would recommend ordering a half size larger than usual They are very easy to pair with clothes and do not stick out The sole is very comfortable and the support in the shoes is great Overall I would recommend this to anyone and you should not pass on this opportunity

The more you wear the more comfortable it will be

I typically wear 9 but for some reason ultraboosts I go half a size up I have narrow feet Shoes are lovely

I love the ultra boost they fit great and are comfortable Only complaint is a tiny defect in the heal area The outsole was cut a little short of the boost midsole

Fit is slightly small so I had to go half size up Overall comfort and quality is great Love that I can just throw them in the washing machine to clean

I like the product because it hugs the side of my feet tightly and holds my foot in place making the shoe very comfortable over all

I love that the shoes are made from recycled ocean plastic and feel like wearing a pair of socks rather than shoes Very comfortable

Perfect sneakers very comfortable The most comfortable sneakers ever had

I was advised to get 0 5 size up I am usually 8 5 so I got size 9 The ankle area seems too tight On day 2 3 I am starting to feel my right big toe with discomfort My toenails are not even long yet The length is longer than my feet so there should be enough allowance But it is not helping Grip is mostly there but I am surprised I lose at some as if someone put a powder on the floor

The urltraboost is an amazing shoe The boost is giant so feel all of it when walking Good for any sport or activity you do

Love the shoes Just wish there was an easy way to get a different size without paying more money

It looks good and comfort levels are off the chart

Great shoe for casual wear and even work in the gym The shoe is great for shorter runs but would recommend looking into more supportive shoes if you are planning longer runs

these shoes are so nice and comfy the only down side is when it gets colder your feet get cold because it lets so much air in but there are running shoes not winter shoes but best shoes ever bought

The Parley program is doing fantastic things for our oceans and the comfort of this shoe is phenomenal

Best parley ultra boost 35th pair of ultra boost so far

Better than vapormaxes definitely would recommend to people that run a lot and heels hurt afterwards

Has a perfect amount of support on all sides as well as for the bottom of the foot Enough breathability for the foot to stay cool and comfortable

Awesome for everyday wear order size up for complete comfort

I got my true size 11 and it seemed to be too tight Then i got a 11 1 2 which fit better I have herd the Parley tend to fit differently from any other boosts

The Boost foam is greatest thing ever created I love it

I like this pair a lot its simple and the color is consistent and smooth across the shoe Underrated color way for sure since it isnt as flashy as a lot of shoes out there but it is still a great looking pair of boost

These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes in the world Not only are they comfortable they are super stylish These are great for pulling off street wear pieces

I cannot say enough about these shoes They has the Boost soles so nothing can beat them just because of that They are really breathable and light They are all white besides the Parley stitching throughout which make these look awesome My favorite all white shoes I have ever had and I am not usually fond of white shoes My dad even liked them

My arches hurt constantly but not with these shoes I definitely recommend them

The most comfortable shoes I ever wore The price is steep but well worth it I am looking into buying more colors

Perfect fit comfortable and sporty Great product

Super comfortable would purchase again great quality

It fits perfectly and materials used do not feel cheap

I have had several parley ultra boosts these climacool are fantastic Same comfort more breath ability Ultra boost still rules the roost

QUALITY IS AMAZING BOOST FOR LIFE SOOOOOOO COMFY

very comfortable the whole shoe fits very nice but in my opinion the laces are just for style because they do not do much but they fit perfectly

Great shoes to workout in and also very awesome to just casual wearing

it is super comfortable and they have good airflow They seem very snug and are good for runs and the gym

Very nice and subtle integration of the parley accents

They are very comfortable The color match is very nice

Got these shoes after seeing my friends wear them but I am different colors Saw these online and no one really had he color so I got them and I have loved them ever since Most comfortable shoes I have ever had Only thing I have noticed is that after a few days of wearing them they begin to look better on your feet as if they mold to you Awesome

I felt very sharp and clean while wearing this shoe

I love the comfort style and fit of the shoes they are great for everyday use

Very comfortable to work out in Little worried about how they will hold up since they are mostly white

Very comfortable shoe very stylish i would strongly recommend a 1 2 size up

This shoe is a standout never had such a comfortable shoe so far The primeknit adapts to your feet so well it feels like more of a sock than a shoe Also it is a clima which means it has amazing breathability Boost midsole best in the world And the fact that it is partly made from recycled bottles its a shoe for a good cause people should definitely buy these One thing to note is that the pictures on the website do not do justice to the appearance of the shoe it looks 10x better in person The pictures miss some detail about the unique colors of the threading Other than that 101 buy this as your next shoe

Other than the tighter mouth of the shoe unlike normal ultraboodts it is perfect

My feet require extra cushion and extra support Ultraboost delivers every bit of what i need Do yourself a favor and get a pair Make sure to get a half size bigger They run a little small

i bought the pair for my husband he loves it so much im buying pair for me too

I bought this shoe for my husband and he loves them Super cool color and style can not wait for youth ultraboost to come out so I can get a pair for my 10yearl old

the color is good nothing wrong except a little bit thin

Material is different then normal ultra boost not as soft Shoes if still comfortable

I like the product because it helps the environment

By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I love the style Hoping to see a Navy Blue Yellow white option as those colors seem to be the style right now

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have been walking in these shoes for a year

the fit and comfort are unmatched the combination of boost and prime knit makes it feel like your feet are not constricted No blisters or having to break in like with many other shoes when brand new

I love the shoes for their comfort and feel it is like walking on clouds in slippers

These shoes look so good in person the fabric is very high quality and the shoes just have that look the cage is sort of blended into the shoe but the layers really make this shoe stand out

I love Ultra Boost and I love Parley so when I saw this colorway was coming out I knew I was copping instantly These feel just like any other Ultra Boost but I love that the cage is fabric For my foot that type of cage is my favorite The sprinkling of the color is perfect in my opinion and makes this a great looking shoe

These shoes are awesome Super comfortable and look great whether you are running or going out

I really enjoy the look and comfort of the Parley shoes They breathe well and they look sharp The downside for me was that they are not optimal for actual training They are a tad bigger than expected but even if I tighten them up the insoles slip around some when doing weighted sprints

This shoe is perfect use it for my workouts while I jog as well as casually

Ultra Boosts are at the penicle of style comfort and performance I highly recommend these shoes

it is my go to sneaker and loving all the 4 0 colorways Only wish they would retro some of the 1 0 colors

Very comfortable as with every ultraboost I owned Been a fan of the parley collaboration

Comfortable nice colors and got it on sale which it was a great steal

Love the shoe but the knit is kind of thight on my feet but overall is a very comfortable shoe

Best ultra boost ever and th comfort level is on another level

The Ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe on the market There I said it My feet had no idea what actual comfort was until I tried Boost technology for the first time It actually feels like you are walking on flipping clouds Especially for those people who work in retail or have jobs that require them to stand for hours at a time this is the go to shoe Immense comfort and it does not seem to tire you out even though you have been standing for 3 hours straight For running these shoes are also solid Stability in the midfoot area from the plastic three stripes and a solid locked down sensation from the heelcuptopped with the Primeknit upper Boost midsole and Continental tire this shoe is perfect to take on those city runs Adidas has set a new standard for running shoes and the other brands have some catching up to do

I like the message behind Parley and the shoes are incredibly comfortable 11 10 would purchase another pair

The shoes fits perfect and It feels amazing Worth the buy

Fit like a glove super comfortable shock absorbent bottom sole awesome grip

True to size fit and unique color scheme I recommend this shoe to others

The boost gets dirty way too quick I recommend making some sort of cleaning solution

Unbelievable shoe that is great for comfort and even better with STYLE They look Perfect with the right pair of Joggers3STRIPELIFE

 Tip of AdviceGo 1 2 a size higher than your normal size

Worst shoe ever the eyeletes rip out and the shoe twists causing ankle twists

They run a bit smaller than the previous generations of ultraboost but still the best shoes ever

I wear the same size in every other brand and style of shoe These we are too small Bummer

Really comfortable Maybe the best shoes for walking that I have ever had

I love this shoes they are very comfortable and quality

I admittedly have more pairs than I should now as once I found Boost I could not stop These are the most comfortable shoes I own and I now own multiple colorways

Loved it The boost is amazingly comfortable and the shoes lasts a while

Comfortable cushions and great looking shoes Good materials

These shoes run one size small After having to send back two times we finally got the right size My son loves them

These shoes are my go to They fit very snugly and the shoe feels like I am stepping on clouds thanks to the thick boost sole Outsole wears out quickly however

Shoes ended up being very tight and narrow Tried wearing them to work on an 8 hr shift and my feet were screaming what is the point of the laces if they are not actually tying anything

These held up walking but then I started running in them and they completely fell apart The inside piece that protects the toes is falling off The boost is all brown and the part underneath the sole is also coming off Previous ultra boosts have been fine but this one is not The quality is not good at all compared to previous ultra boosts so beware

Ultraboost will not disappoint best shoes out there The comfort level and the technology in the boost has yet to disappoint buying more

My 5th Ultraboost and love this colorway from the Parley collab You can never go wrong with the Ultraboosts

great comfort and fit Would recommend to anyone that wants a great wearing shoe

The only small complaint I would have about them is that they can be a tad uncomfortable to wear when sitting long periods especially driving in my opinion However you should not be sitting down when wearing these

The shoes are very comfortable and can be worn with any fit

The pictures do not do this colorway justice I lost count of how many Ultra Boost I have collected since 2015 The multicolor primeknit and statue of liberty colored heel and cage looks amazing in real life on feet a must for any collector To help people out with size info I am a 13 but have and wear sizes 12 to 13 in the Ultraboost for this 4 0 colorway I highly recommend going down half a size from your true size as I fit in a 12 5 with the insole in place not removed perfectly like a glove and have plenty of stretch to raise my big toes that is a must in any sneaker for me idk why lol Classic shoe buy a pair or a few you will love them

This is my first pair of Ultraboosts and I did not anticipate how comfortable they are I had a pair of pureboosts before and this is actually a lot better on my feet They look great and gave me no foot pain at all

First I had the pureboost which was not as comfy as this ultraboost but now this is the best thing I ever bought

Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Great shoes and helps out a great cause I just wish I was informed about a small size difference for this particular brand being ParleyXAdidas They do not match the standard Adidas sizing I would need I would normally get a 7 5 but in these I think I need an 8 because my big toe is at the very top of the shoe If I would have known this I would have ordered the 8 Other than that they are great quality shoes

Yes Boosts are costing more and more But they are still one of the best lineups out there Comfiest shoe you will find and unlike so many others this one BREATHS and your feet will not be sweating in 30 minutes

Extremely comfortable and stylish By far my favorite shoes I own I will probably be buying a second pair

No hyperbole Incredibly comfortable sole and shoe

For Parley UBs make sure to go half size up as these tend to be a little more snug than usual on regular UBs

It took my son 2 years to find the exact sneaker that he wantedhe finally got these They are perfect for him

Very narrow and unlike the addidas I have had before

2nd pair of Boost in 2 weeks I bought The Black NYC Bodega ones last week after doing the other big brand for decades These Boost have them beat for comfort hands down Anyhow the fit and finish are perfect to me I do not sweat tiny glue smears as i understand production and it just rolls off with finger easily enough The heel fits great and nice open toe box of this design makes them comfortable wether i wear cushioned no shows or slim running no shows No movement in foot at all Thanks Adidas I love both pairs but am partial to the all black

After 9 months I am going to throw away it because of the awful fabric that now has a lot of ties

The most comfortable sneakers ever These shoes are so light and comfy love them

Great shoes A little snug for wide feet you do not notice it at first may want to go half size up Overall very comfortable with the sock like upper

Came quickly fit perfectly well made and my son loves them

From the Prime Kit upper to the Boost midsole I have no complaints about the shoe Bought as my first pair of Ultraboost and will not be my last

For the price of this shoe the glue holding it together should not be smudged in different areas

Maximum comfort is what I needed and maximum comfort is what I got Adidas really knocked it out of the park with this one

The knit upper is a sturdy material that is soft and stretch The toebox is very roomy and they run true to size unlike others I have tried As for the mid shoe it is been a long time since I have felt secure and support at same time

I own about 20 pairs of Ultraboost so I really like the shoes This colorway has hints of maroon and green sort of like Mardi Gras colors

Best fit and comfort designed for whole day walking and working

I truly love these shoes Originally did not like some of the other ultraboost models but after I bought this pair it is hard to choose anything else

Soft nice design and very comfortable I like it so much

Most comfortable shoes I own I have worn them every day since I got them

Style and fit is amazing Want to buy another pair soon

Super comfortable and they look fresh af go all white

Very comfortable and perfect fit I would definitely recommend these shoes

Feels like a cloud use these for going to the gym

These shoes are very comfortable and you can dirty them up as much as you want and they will stay awesome

I love the ultraboost because the mix of colors is lovely and the boost is simply amazing My only problem is that the tongue is a little short so there are marks on my feet after wearing for a long time Overall really excellent product i am satisfied greatly

I keept hearing great thing about ultra boost cushioning So is got myself a pair of ultra boost parley Super comfy really light but I feel a little too tight at the front tongue area after a while it feels like it is blocking my blood from flowing to my legs I was just wondering if anyone felt like that

Words cannot describe how comfortable this shoe is it is perfect one of the best shoes ever made

Even though I do not like how Adidas is overdoing the ultraboost and undermining them BUT we are talking about this one Ultraboost have really changed the history of sneakersExtra comfortable and so stylish I just wish Adidas appreciate them more and focus more on keeping its value

i totaly love the design and style although the tripple white color way gets dirty easily though my core blacks are probably my favorite pairs of shoes ever

Very comfortable pair of shoes I would recommend them

The fact that adidas is using recycled plastic as the shoe material is the main reason I chose this product My feet look good and are saving the world at the same time

The UB Parleys are very comfortable and well designedone thing I would point out though is that the shoe is a bit tight I definitely recommend going half size up but overall a great purchase

I will stay with the PureBoost for running shoes

The only complaint I could have is the inside lining ending halfway down the laces ending abruptly when the laces are tied tighter it makes it very uncomfortable

If you like walking on marshmallows get these you will be glad you did it

great shoe for everyday wear along with a simple and great look

These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have run in However after about 175 miles the soles are nearly worn through Other shoes I have run in last a lot longer than 5 weeksa dollar per mile is a bit too much

the ultraboost is an extremely comfortable and stylish shoe

I recommend these as they are absolutely comfortable and look sick

Love the shoe When the 4 0first dropped I knew I had to get a pair I got mine in the gray colorway and fits perfect I have small wide and flat feet so glad that it fit me perfectly Perfect as a running shoe and a lifestyle shoe Great materials should last you awhile I have had mine for a year and it still looks brand new

I just bought these shoes and wore them for the first time today I love the fit of them and the go together with a lot of my outfits I am going to wear them everyday I can

Nice shoes I would buy them again

Awesome silhouette Get the limited collaborations if you can The materials on the Consortium parcks are really good

Ultraboosts in general provide some of the most cushioning in a shoe I personally have encountered without the need to break in like some competing shoes These specific limited edition version come imbued with a reflective material in the mesh that also make for a great aesthetic

This product embodies every quality of a perfect running shoes while also feeling like a comfortable shoe for casual wear It has a sock like upper but still keeps hold of your foot well when running in terrain I can not take them off

Really comfortable i prefer if it would come in all black

What I like about these shoes are also that they look very nice for lifestyle

CONSNONE

great value on a great product in a great brand as always

This product has the best cushion of any shoes I own They are great for running and stylish enough to just wear around

Small and narrow cant say if they are comfortable or not was not able to wear them Cause they are small

Boost is life it is pretty well known now but it is just as great as ever These Ultraboosts are the perfect blend of knit upper comfortable step in and walking comfort and style does not hurt that you might be saving a little sea turtle as well

Have been a boost fan since 1 0 and still love what the model has to offer

The primeknit upper is super comfortable and lightweight the boost midsole is responsive and feels like walking on cloud and the rubber outsole is grippy and I never slipped while wearing them

I can not say whether I like them or not because I never even got to see them they were taken off my porch

Great fit Super comfortable Wear it with my scrubs in the clinic Perfect if you are standing for long periods of time

I have to say I was expecting more from the Ultraboost after all the hype The Boost in the sole is great but this can be had in several other shoes My main problem was fit there is a thick stitch running under the tongue of the shoe at the top of the laces and I found that this irritated the top of my foot to the point of cutting off my circulation in a true to size shoe I even tried going up half a size as well as a full size and while the issue was lessened it still remained I have average arch height so I suspect others also experience this issue to some degree I had to return these and I am sticking with the Ultraboost Uncaged for now which do not have any internal seams or stitches and work great for me

Perfectly comfortable and fitting for both narrow and wide feet I like the color combination It is comfortable for running and you will not get blisters

These shoes are extremely comfortable and stylish Never can go wrong with a pair of these

Amazing My only one shoes not only running but also for everyday work

First of all I can not get enough of the ultra boost series This shoe is AMAZING Love the stitching and how comfortable they are I feel like I am on a cloud when I wear them I would recommend the parley series to anyone such a classy comfortable look to make any outfit look good 10 10

The shoes look and feel great They look good with everything and it is a great buy

Always skeptical of buying expensive shoes not with ultra boost though Comfort and color ways are awesome Boost all day wear for sure

My grandson likes them so well that he now has 2 pair of the same shoe each in a different color

its so comfy and yet so fashionable there also great for working out in

I am a wide footer so I was worried that the Parleys would be too tight for me feet When I initially tried them on they were still a bit tight but I decided to try breaking them in for a week wore them around the house and now they are just as comfy as my other boosts

I bought a pair and the quality is so bad i can see the glue

Everyone else is Second

These sneakers are super cool Comfy super light great for distance runs Shipped quickly Totally worth the money

Extremely comfortable fit clean design primeknits are just too good to pass up on

The tan color on the heel and sole is more of a peach pink Looks feminine and unattractive Seriously disappointed after receiving this hyped order

Just wish it came with black soles otherwise an awesome shoe

These shoes are so comfy Love the soles it feels like you are walking on a cloud I would not recommend going up a half size like some have suggested I tried that and it felt like I was wearing a clown shoe I got another pair for my true size and they fit perfectly They are pretty snug though wear thin socks

These 4 0 Ultraboost feels great similar to the 1 0 pattern but slightly changed Overall an awesome shoe

Very comfortable and are quality shoes I Recommend

The Ultraboost 4 0s run kinda small but are super super comfortable They are my favorite running shoes

Was looking for a more casual pair of comfort shoes that also were stylish and good looking Had Ultraboost on my radar for the longest time and finally pulled the trigger and was not disappointed A great looking shoe very great comfort as well Also fit true to size

Most comfortable shoe I own Best everyday walkers

Super cool to see the 3M added to Ultraboosts in this way In the daylight it is sorta there then at night you shoes light up

I have never wear Ultra boost before after putting this on I love it

Really nice shoe that fits good It would be a better value if this shoe had a lower price

I use these as one of my everyday shoes They are awesome and comfortable

Ultraboost are crazy comfortable Highly recommend

Super fast shipping super awesome shoes great fit

Very comfortable and good looking but where the lace goes through broke after 2 months so I cant where them anymore

This shoe is comfortable as all other Ultra boosts are though they give you that extra feeling of comfort knowing that you helped contribute to saving the oceans

The shoes are very comfortable one of the best shoes that has boost if you can afford the price tag Must say the heel and get scratched easily if you wear them often

These fit great and are comfortable for my son with his Xcountry running My son is the one who is wearing these These are also great looking

Love it Best tennis shoe ever Love the color material and it is so comfortable

Bought these for my son he absolutely loves them Perfect fit

the shoes are very comfortable but after a long day at band c and they get a bit tough to stand still in but over all one of the best purchases i have made

This pair is awesome Super comfy and lightweight I love them

Product looks good and feels great I will continue to purchase Adidas products I really like adidas designs

These shoes do not hurt my feet one bit which makes them a pleasure to wear

I like it because they look very nice and slick and also are very comfortable Also easy to wash because white gets dirty so easy

I bought these for my son who really lives the style and the comfort of these shoes

This shoe is very narrow While it does expand a little it is nkt quite there for me But I get what I get

The material is not like primeknit it feels just like recycled material

I love the parleys because they are very comfortable and they are made from recycled materials to keep the world clean Adidas needs to make shoes in wide sizes and they need to step up there game in color ways that pop

They look great and feel great Stylish and comfortable

Lightweight Ultraboost that is comfortable and fits like a glove Great style and color combination

Great colors super comfortable great running walking shoe

i bought these for my boyfriend and he has obsessed with them and will not take them off wears them to workout and to dinner help

As Always Ultraboost is an extraordinary sneaker with no doubt but please guys you should state that this one runs 1 2 small I own 4 pair of UB 4 0 and I wear 7 and I bought this one in 7 and it is tight and small and I should have gone 1 2 a size up so be aware of that

Shoes are extremely comfortable and have a nice snug fit but they are very expensive

Best pair of Adidas I have own so far The partnership with parley which uses bottles collected from ocean to make these shoes makes it even better

 am grandson loves them and has gotten many compliments

hurt my feet balls of my feet to run in these

These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever bought They feel like I am walking or running on clouds They are very easy on the knees especially after an intense workout

Good but they are ripping apart from the sole within only 2 weeks also the cage is coming undone from the shoe not the quality I was expecting and I only wore them 2 to run in

The tongue of the shoe is sticking into the top of my foot and sort of hurts after a while

The shoe is extremely comfortable and can be used casually or for running Boost is by far the most comfortable cushioning system

These shoes are amazing for wearing them regularly to school and work These might be one of the best shoes I have purchase

Love this shoes best cushioning well ventilated and look great Bought one pair for my girlfriend and she loves it too

One of the best shoes I have ever worn you should definitely buy these shoes

Very comfortable and stylish that I bought two pair

Super comfortable and stylish i could wear these all day

Feels great on my feet Very comfortable Nice color

It is amazing because it not only looks nice but is so comfortable

Adidas is hiding something They are too comfortable

Love the look comfort slightly little tight small in size but no complaints

Great shoe I ordered a 1 2 size up and they fit perfect

I like the product because they shoes are very comfortable and since I use them for work my feet never hurt and I be looking good as well so thankyou for making an amazing product and keep doing you

There comfy and I love to wear them to school Wish I could get 1 million pairs beacasue I wear those everyday

I bought these for running on hard surfaces and I have been blown away by their comfort and responsiveness A little pricey but worth it to not have shin splints

Buy this shoe it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

They look pretty lit and are hellla comfortable too

Beautiful stylish shoe very well made super comfortable i suggest going 1 size bigger very snug shoe

I like the shoes very much it is high quality shoes Good for everyday use I like the quality of the materials it is very comfortable and stylish My job involves a lot of standing for a long period of time and this shoes help ease all the pressure Overall I am very satisfied with this shoes and the price I paid for I love Adidas and I would buy again in the near future

Low profile But a big enough sole for serious cushioning

Nice good looking shoes to add to your shoe collection

I love the ultra boost as a friend told me it was the most comfterble shoe and I agree recommend to anyone who likes light stylish soft shoes

This shoes is perfect comportable So I expect to release Ultraboost 1 0

I loved this shoe and very comfy would definitely buy again

My son absolutely loves these shoes Very comfortable

The purchase was a birthday gift for my grandchild He loved the shoes He said they fit perfect and were very comfortable I am concerned about him keeping them white and clean He was very impressed that I bought him those shoes

I love ultra boost I just do not like the feel of this shoe too hot for long runs

The Ultra Boost shoes are incredible I have a bad back and bad knees which cause my feet to hurt The technology in the Boost really works for me and I am able to wear the shoes all day at work and they really help my back knees and of course my feet from hurting so much I personally recommend these shoes to anyone I meet know This is all coming from a disabled military Veteran Thank you Adidas for making such a terrific shoe

Great look extremely comfortable Awesome color choices The parley collaborations are always on point and help a great cause Waiting for a white pair with green stripes

Extremely comfortable These are VERY snug out of the box but once they are broken in you will not want to take them off Put them through their paces on a recent transatlantic trip perfect for all day and in flight wear

Super Comfortable I work on my feet for long shifts and it is perfect

Great fit Comfortable Good price for the quality

Unique color scheme great fit looks even better in person

One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever had it is a must buy

Fits like a glove extremely comfortable and sweet design

Shoes are perfect I am a runner and they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever ran in

Use them as work shoes Most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Received a defective shoes The cut of the sole was not right Even though my feet is not wide the shoes width is narrow

Just like any other ultraboosts it is very comfortable Love the design and color of the shoes I am a female who wheres menultraboosts because it is much wider making it much more comfortable for my feet

insole came with non matching pair comfortable and fit well around ankle

I like this product because they are very comfortable and are a good running shoe

Best shoes I own they are super comfortable and stylish I would buy again

The shoes look great and are extremely comfortable

Adidas Continental and Parley Max comfort Great style Awesome support

I bought these for my son for his birthday He loves them Best money I have soent

Very comfortable and looks great Really appreciate the effort Adidas has made to use recycled material Quite warm so probably not the best summer shoe

Great comfort and quality Fits perfectly and looks stylish

If you have showings not on the inside making it very uncomfortable to where I am waiting on a return label so I can return the product

dry cushiony and love the continental rubber bottoms

Great product Perfect fit Wish they came in black

great shoe the nubs on the bottom wear down rather quickly white soles are only white for a day thoughthey turn dirty after wearing them

Most comfortable sneaker I ever owned and I have thousands

Very nice quality and supremely cloud like I would 10 10 recommend to anyone else

So much comfort Feel like I am walking on a cloud

Most comfortable shoe I have ever bought and definitely worth the money

After wearing them for a month I can say that these shoes are incredibly comfortable and look great I have the multicolor collegiate navy version which is now sold out online However I have had multiple issues One is the fit I ordered true to size and the length was perfect the width was a bit narrow but the primeknit was so tight that my big toe was sticking out or in this case up I read that the primeknit would stretch out a lot which is why I kept them unfortunately I did not realize that they were talking about the previous versions which were more stretchy I removed the very thick insoles so that the primeknit only pressed on my toes slightly I then stuffed the shoes with paper which made them looser and a bit wider Doing that solved all of my fit problems If you have wide feet I recommend sizing up 0 5 size Some other problems I hadthe heel cup where it says ultra boost got multiple scratches after just a few weeks of wear it is not really noticeable though unless you look closely The cage also got sort of scratched up or worn off I have included a picture I cleaned it but it is still a bit discolored once again it is not very noticeable The boost midsole can get pretty dirty so make sure to clean it regularly All of those problems aside the shoes are incredibly comfortable At first I thought they are comfortable but not THAT comfortable but after wearing them for a month and then putting on my other shoes I now know that Ultra Boosts are definitely the most comfortable shoes ever

Love the light weight and the knit top but the plastic used for the shoe lacing digs into my foot To be returned

They are comfortable and stylish I am a woman but wear the menstyles

I really like this colorway but I hope you produce this colorway with black midsole because it looks a lot better than white midsole overall

They feel comfortable and they look really nice 12

I was looking for the most comfy shoe in the world to walk around in on concrete specifically and just so happened to stumble upon these bad boyz Out of the box these things were good to go for a 12 hour shift moving around on concrete no break in needed The most breathable shoe ever which is always a good thing here in Houston Looks beautiful I do not know what else I could ask for in a shoe

Very comfy Love ultraboosts so much They form to your foot so well

I like the feel but still too tight for my liking I recommend buying a shoe that is a half size larger than your typical purchase

product was everything it was advertised as Fit perfectly and are super comfortable

Walked for miles and felt absolutely no discomfort

It is super comftorable and very light on the feet

If your gonna spend 160 or 140 on a pair of UltraI would buy the Parley editions just cause I know its for a good cause and the quality really shows

its best product adidas its parfect i also like it

boost midsole amazing primeknite amazing love the shoe boost is life

Still very comfortable and fits well enough Helping save the oceans too

First pair of Ultraboost shoes and I love them The color is cool and they feel comfortable

Its is a great shoes and looks super fi but gets dirty very easily

Perfectly comfortable amazing shoe My current favorite shoe

I love how the shoe snugs your feet perfectly Some people prefer wearing it without the soles they are a bit more loose like that but maintain the sock like fit around the ankle Great shoe for running or casual wear

do not get me wrong the shoes are super comfortable the only problem is that after two days the soles show glue marks and seem to be very poorly put together Still the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

The shoe is a little costly but it is definitely worth it The comfort of the shoe is amazing it fits well and looks good to top it off can not get over how comfy they are though

I love the shoe it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

Amazing looking and comfortable sneaker overall Only problem was the ankle support was a bit too tight for me The Climas are probably going to be my go to from now on when it comes to Ultra Boost

The shoe is good but the parley materials did not feel as great as normal materials and the size I got was a bit too small so did not fit too well Boost was great

It was great price and my son loved the shoes He loved the fit and the style

My boyfriend is really big on comfortable shoes so he really loves Ultra Boosts Bought these for him and so far they are his favorite

They feel as good as they look Ultraboosts are the way to go if you want a reliable pair of running or every day shoes

They are unbelievably comfortable and look very sleek at the same time

So comfortable and they look great can not buy a better shoe they are a little big but it is not a huge issue Would recommend

I bought one pair of these shoes and had to get another because they are so comfortable

do not feel the same as my other boosts Slightly more narrow of a entry hole and feel like there is less cushion

I like them and they are comfortable The only issues I have with them is the white sole

After I received my Ultraboosts 4 0s I was a little disappointed when I noticed all of the manufacturer glue spots on the shoes They are extremely comfortable and stylish but I wish they would have had less glue spots Overall good shoes

Simple design No obnoxiously large logos Clean

I love ultra boosts and these are no exception They definitely need to stretch when you first wear them but besides that there amazing

These things feel amazing worth every single cent There is no turning back I hope your wallet is ready

Despite Adidas usual problem of shoes running half a size large this is still the most comfortable shoe out there

Awesome shoes Stylish and COMFORTABLE will not regret your purchase

I have bought a couple pairs of ultraboosts and enjoyed them all The parley is one of the best running shoes I have ever purchased at first it might be tight and narrow but it eventually becomes very comfortable and a great shoe to work out with I will definitely continue to purchase ultraboost products in the future

This is the first pair of ultraboost I have purchased and certainly will not be my last The most comfortable shoes I have ever walked in

There is not a single show in the market that I believe is more comfortable than the Ultraboost

Good fit and comfortable shoe It could use improvement in the sole padding by adding some pores so you can wear the shoe sock less My feet sticks to the bottom and gets sweaty if I do not wear socks

Where Comfort meets Style Third pair of Adidas Ultra Boost what more do I need to say

Really like this shoe but ended up having to return it because the toe box is just too small on them Anyone getting these should definitely go up a half size

I love the style of this shoe This is my first pair of Ultraboost so it took some getting used to as compared to Boosts It fits snug around my foot but has stretched out a bit and now it is perfect

Love this shoe I have had many before great product

I liked it for the comfort but i feel that it was a little over hyped

I am writing this review when the shoes are 140 US dollars which is just awesome Personally I do not think the pictures do the shoes justice The upper material has a more aqua ish color than is seen in the pictures And the plastic threads do not make much of a difference in comfort Great shoes overall and even greater cause with Parley

The best shoe I have ever purchased Just make sure to get 1 2 size larger

Very comfortable and unique with the materials used

What I wanted in the shoes but I have to enter minimum number of text to submit this review

I walk a lot and this shoe is perfect cusion needed

Purchased as a gift and it is the best ever So good he does not want to wear them

Best fitting cushioned all day wearing type of shoe Best purschase ever

I recommend this shoes for run long distance or every day used

I love the shoe except it is a little tight on the top of my left foot I have 6 pair of Boost and this is the only one with that issue

So far I have worn these for walks around the neighborhood and the comfort is good I measure an 8 would on the Brannock Device and find an 8 1 2 in this style to be a comfortable fit The support is a bit lacking due to the soledesign to squishOverall these are comfortable athletic shoes

GREAT SHOE COMFY ALL DAY LONG ON CONCRETE GOOD FOR RUNNNING

Sadly having to return these They fit tighter than my normal Ultraboost Otherwise the shoe is gorgeous and I love Adidas making products with recycled materials

The soles help with my flat feet Feels like bouncing around when you walk

Very cushiony Soft upper feels like a sock Question long term durability though

Supporting the environment and very comfortable shoes

I love the colorway and while the cage is different and the whole shoe is not as customizable as plastic caged UBs it is still very comfy and feels great for walking or standing in I wish it came with a second set of laces that are the same color as the heel cup

Recommended if you are into the colorway As my first pair of UB I did not know what to expect other than comfort I wish I had gotten the laceless UB instead

Bought the parley boost as a gift for my daughter bday and she loved it and what it stood for

I love adidas All I am really trying to do is be a walking billboard for them I do not know what it is about their marketing c and aign but it got me hook line and sinker Love the products Keep it up

The color way is very nice This is my second pair of ultraboosts

I got these for both running and for everyday casual wear I love the comfort color and design But I had to order a half size up since the shoes are tight Otherwise it is an awesome pair to be wearing around

I like this product because it is a good running shoe that also looks good

Great product little expensive but worth it I would recommend to anyone for running and casual wear

The colour way is nice but too narrow If you went half size up you will get alots of toe room If you went true to size and you have wide foot you might want to take off your insole

I have been wanting some Ultraboost shoes for a good while and I am so happy that I finally did I love the Parley collaboration it makes for a good talking point because people WILL tell you that your shoes look cool Sizing is perfect I did go up a half just for my personal preference but I would have done fine with a standard 10 5 I work at a grocery store and have put some heavy wear and miles in them already after a month and while they naturally have gotten dirty they feel brand new every time I slip them on

lil more snug than normal ultra boost feet fall asleep after a short bit maybe just have to understand that i need to sacrifice comfort for supreme style if you catch my drift

The product is extremely well made comfortable and looks great

Extremely versatile Stylish and performs Have two pairs and might get a third

Besides being a bit small and narrow this is my favorite purchase I have ever made Parley is an amazing partnership for adidas to have and will hopefully change how people choose what to wear

I started with a pair of Ultraboost STthat I have had for about a year and decided to go ahead and purchase two pairs of UltraboostWhile these and the STdiffer both are great shoes and I love the little differences between them These shoes are almost like walking on clouds

I have seen some reviews of this shoe concerning the durability of the sole so I will have to see how it holds up

The top of the shoe is so tight that I feel it would kill my nerves if wearing for a prolonged period After only a couple of mile with them on I started feeling tingling and numbing on the foot due to the nerve and tendon cutoff caused by the tight top Although the boost midsole is comfortable I am still gonna return them as the tight top is really a deal breaker to me

I liked the product though it was too big Wish I could have ordered a 10 5 for the same price

I like it it is very comfortable and very good for casual wear

This are the best shoes so far i have bought they feel good and for the first time i tried this They are comfortable and are true to size One thing i kind of dislike is that putting your foot inside the shoe does take some time to get in because they are a little tight from the show hole but besides that great shoes for running

I liked everything up to the heel were there was like a thicker fabric as the support instead of the usual plastic heel support

Love them The color is my favorite I do want another pair of these shoes just a different color

They look great and the ultra boost is really comfortable but the upper was extremely constricting I even ordered 1 2 size up It was okay if I was standing or walking but if I sat at my desk after a little while my toes would start to get numb This is even with them completely unlaced Had to return

The shoe is awesome I would recommend anyone to buy Ultra boosts

beautiful shoe fits perfect great design and overall great purchase

I respect what adidas is doing with the Parley movement so it made sense to purchase The ran a little snug but once I took the insoles out perfect I can walk for hours and not feel the strain on my feet

Comfy Shoes Great Look Great Fit Would Highly Recommend

Good sneaker wish it was sized more appropriately

Shoes are very comfortable for daily activities and they look great They shoes also hold up in the long run

I think it is amazing they are made out of ocean plastic the blue design is pretty awesome the first few times I wore them they were pretty tight but now it fits perfect after a week of breaking them in Wearing them at work right now

Colorway is awesome and goes great with ER scrubs Looking good and saving the oceans

I am still experiencing a tingling sensation in foot

I am very glad I bought a half size up These shoes are very comfortable and have great support but they are narrow and in my opinion run small The opening is also kind of small and there is no way to make it bigger If you have wide feet these would be a poor choice of shoes They are very good running shoes though

The shoes are comfortable and a good looking shoe too

They took a few days to break in comfort fit wise So at first I was not sure about the ultra boost hype but now all my other shoes are disappointing to put on

I love the look of these shoes but I have flat feet and these do not have much in terms of arch support

First time tryin out Ultr Boost I am impressed and they are worth the money A shoe that you can wear anywhere

I always wear the same size for adidas but the parley seems to be narrower which makes it less comfortable compared to my other ultraboost I am not sure if half a size bigger would have made it better

The cushion is awesome and the quality is great Makes it feel like I am running on a mattress

This is my sons favorite athletic shoe They are the most comfortable shoe for sports or leisure

I have enjoyed many complements on these sneakers It is neat I can share a story of it being manufactured from ocean from the ocean I feel that this purchase helped our world and that feels good The shoes are Ok the plastic feels thin and the innersole keeps coming out So far they remain clean however I am not sure how long that will be I am also not sure how long I can go without a solid surface on the outside

Very satisfied with purchasing these ultraboost they look awesome in hand very stylish with great comfort and you help out a little with cleaning ocean plastic its a win win for everybody

Comfortable high quality conforms well to your foot and the boost is real nice

Recycled ocean plastic great Make the yeezy buying process more fair please

Perfect blend of comfort and style plus going to a good cause 10 10

Really Comfortable shoes Great for running and look good for lifestyle wear Love the environmental story behind the shoes

I own a couple NMDs and people always told me UB was more comfortable Gonna have to agree True to size also but if you are between sizes I would recommend going bigger I wear 11 5 12 and 12 is sometimes too big in Adidas ie Dame 4s alphabounce but these are pretty snug in 12

I love the boost and quality of these shoes The only thing I am kinda neutral about are the cages not a big fan of them I love the cages from your 1 0 3 0

I love the boost it is a good shoe to workout in as well

Ultraboost has the best comfort of any shoe I have tried yet

Not really feeling the colorway but the feel is where it is at and they were on sale so why not right

Fits much better than the uncaged more reinforced than the others

It fits a bit narrow I guess because the knit is brand new However after a few 5k runs they get the so much confy If you want to go run and still look cool THIS is the shoe

Always like ultra boost but for me they tend to run small

I have not used these for running yet but they are so incredibly soft and comfortable to wear around Love the sock like feel I feel as though they had be perfect for slower paced recovery runs too Well done Adidas

I only have a pair of 4 0 Ultraboosts to compare them to but I would say size up a half size as the upper seems a little tight I only have one wear in them so no complaints other than that so far I love the collaboration between Parley and Adidas and also the aesthetics of the shoe They look better on foot than in pictures as well

it is comfortable and breathes well I will probably buy again

Im not going to lie i got these shoes for my buddybirthday They look great absolutely quality He really enjoys them and their comfort

Comfy I like the increase upward curved angle on forefoot and toe Doing the environment good is a plus

Aside from saving the environment the comfort of these shoes is outstanding

Love supporting eco friendly are use of materials in a stylish and comfortable product Wish they did this more often

These are most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The upper is like wearing grandmas hand knit socks The boost lower is like walking on clouds made of trampolines I am only worried that I may wear them out too fast because I wear them everywhere Also I wear an 11 11 5 ordered an 11 5 probably could have done an 12

Picked these up a few weeks ago and have been wearing them often I went half size up compared to nmds and most other Adidas sneakers I own and the fit was perfect I have moderately wide feet and these accommodated me nicely pure boosts for example never quite worked out for me as far as fit The upper has a comfortably snugly fit and you can honestly get away with wearing these with the laces loose

The shoes are great They are comfortable but a bit tight The only problem I have is the insole is very loose and when taking your foot out the insole can fall out

There is a plastic toecap inside the shoe that catches on my toenails when I wear thin socks such as no shows Most comfortable midsole of any shoe I have ever owned and the upper fits like a sock

The Parley is executed perfectly and for a good cause

Great quality very comfortable and perfect for running 

I like this product cause I tried many different kind of running shoe and walking shoe so far this best product I purchased

I like it for the look and feel of the shoe The foam is very different from other shoes The only complaint is they are pretty narrow and run small

I loved these shoes I have been looking for some adidas to go with my joggers and these are great So comfortable and they look so good at the same time Definitely planning on getting more soon

I truly believed that I had the best looking UltraBoost until these Anniversary ones came out The 3M over the whole shoe is beautiful

Most comfy shoes I have ever owned not to mention they look dope Love them

I should preface this review by saying that I am not an advanced or hardcore runner I am trying to get back into running after a few years of neglect I have gone through several pairs of running shoes though and these were not just good in my opinion Holy smokes I have never worn running shoes that were this comfortable before This is probably in part due to the fact that these are my first experience with Adidas Boost which I now see is widely recognized as exceptional It is extremely cushiony and springy when I run and just generally nice feeling This model which I have found elsewhere is a clima model though it is not explicitly stated on the website that I could see does have incredible ventilation It is summer and it is hot and when I run in these it is like there is a fan blowing on my feet Lastly I am not in love with Adidas running shoes looks I think just about everybody else does a better job This is completely personal preference and I am sure there are plenty of people who would disagree Having said that among Adidas running shoes these are some of the best looking The white is nice but it is better because of the blue undertones which are much more visible in person than they are in pictures I just think that these are good looking shoes Do they get dirtyI am a sure they will but I have about 20 miles in them so far and they look fine I imagine a good mud puddle would change that though

Its fits perfectly I can run faster wearing these shoes

always happy with ultraboost shoes they fit me just right and are super comfortable now I am also helping to keep plastic waste out of the oceans

UBs are extremely comfortable and feel very stable in the heel and arch once you get the correct size it is a bit of a chore to sneak your foot into them but they stabilize well around your heel achilles ankle when on

Great quality need wide widths Comfortable when laced as lose as possible

This is my second pair of Ultraboosts and I love them just as much as the first it is comfort style and durability make it literally the perfect shoe for anything your day throws at you

This is the best and I will always get these shoes over anything

Good comfortable well worth the money However it only cost adidas 46 dollars to make this shoe

This shoe is very versatile in the sense that it is stylish enough to be used as a lifestyle shoe as well as comfortable enough to be a used as a running shoe

Responsible great looking fit great comfortable

Feels great and is very comfortable but if you have a wide food you should probably go half a size or a size up

Best shoe I have ever own everyone should own one of these

These shoes are like heaven on my feet The Boost cushioning is springy and light The knit upper has a slight elasticity that hugs the foot Both of these factors contribute to the vet Boosts being the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I had some reservations about the price tag but after trying them on they are worth every penny I will just have to take good care of them to make sure they last

This is really great shoe of comfort for step I take it is like stepping on clouds you can also wear them as casual of ou like but be careful on not getting dirty with types of liquids because it can leave a stain on the plastic and fabric But truthfully every shoe is like that Shoes are meant to be dirty in time anyway Again this shoe is amazing but it is very tight in time it will be lose it is like wearing socks but it is a little bit thicker But that is normal if it is tight on you Overall really great shoe to wear

Quality product for a great cause I love the Ultra Boots fit

These shoes look great I love the colors with the exception of the always dirty white outsole The problem is that the Earth Day 2018 Parley UltraBoost with the teal mint colored fabric heel cup have a different material on the inner collar and sock liner that is not nearly as plush or comfortable as most 4 0or 3 0It is more of a mesh material on these which irritates my ankle I will also reiterate what some other reviewers have said which is that the fabric heel cup on these is also noticeably tighter than the plastic counters on most UltraBoost which may provide a little better lockdown but is not as comfortable Finally although I do like the look of the fabric cage I do not like that it is slightly shiny and it often bends into odd positions because it is not as stable as the usual plastic rubber ones For these reasons I will likely be returning these which is a shame because I really do like them otherwise While I can not recommend this specific pair I do recommend any other pair of UltraBoost this is the first pair I have come across that I did not like

Great looking shoes nice color Very comfortable definitely buy another pair

Nothing beats the comfort of the boost technology

The best adidas shoe I have purchased so far I love the style and they are incredibly comfortable They are extremely light and incorporate the climacool experience perfectly Definitely recommend to anyone

Bought them for my boyfriend because we love the ultra boost material We both own several pairs because they are literally the most comfortable shoes we have ever worn in our lives We liked the message behind the Parley shoe and the colors are super cute

Wish I ordered half a size larger than normal Slightly tight on top of my foot Trying to stretch it out by putting inserts in while not wearing still have not seen the results yet

I loved the product super soft and stylish but unfortunately they ran one whole size too small

If you want to walk a 100 miles and look and feel good in every step buy these shoes

Ultra Boost has got to be the most comfortable shoe I have ever set foot on The amount of Boost in them is just phenomenal The materials used and the build quality are excellent Me wearing this pretty much every day despite the minimalistic design speaks to how dope they look and how ridiculously comfortable they are But this color way in particular has got to be the coolest Ultra Boost of all time The photos do not give them justice Trust me just get them and see and feel for yourself I have bought one for myself and one for my dad and I have never seen him more hyped about a shoe ever Definitely satisfied with this purchase

The pics are a bit misleading where I thought these were more on the black grey side Turns out they are green I usually wear size 10 but I had to order 10 5 even then the shoe is tight in my right foot I guess with more use it will loosen up

My first UB 4 0 This shoe meets expectations as usual I have wide and thick feet muscle of course and I could probably go up half a size but it is not much of a problem Quality is on point for an UB The 3M is a nice touch

They yellow in the soles on the boost and the cage basically unwearable because they look nasty after only 1 year DO NOT BUY

They are bretty cheap but look expensive

My first adidas shoe was a harden vol 1 and I loved them other than they were a tad too small and they kind of tore apart on the inside of the ankle part of the shoe because of this So on this shoe I ordered a 1 2 size up and it fit perfect I love these shoes I wear them every where Even around the house I will for sure order another pair some day If the price comes down I guarantee they would sell even more and faster And I would probably order my next pair even sooner But alas They are pricey

Hard to find stuff to where with them but super clean

This is without a doubt the most comfotable shoe I have ever owned The style the comfort and the fit are all perfect 10 10 would recommend

I love these shoes but there is only one issue I bought them in the summer where it so hot in them

I love these shoes Feels like i am walking on a cloud great support and comfort and look great too

I do like the product but I was a little underwhelmed by the craftsmanship of the shoe A few glue stains and the toebox is different on each shoe which is disappointing for a very expensive shoe Comfort is amazing however

Love the shoe Comfortable shoe good for running to Love the idea of the shoe history and how it was made

When I got this in the mail I was expecting what I have seen in the quality from the ultra boost line in other non parley editions Not only does it really make me feel better by helping the environment but it also feels easily just as comfortable if not more so than regular ultra boosts but it is also surprisingly lighter than the usual shoe I think due to the use of fabric rather than plastic in the cage structure Well done Adidas

It feels great on my feet The shoes also looks stylish

Love Ultraboost and the climacool is a nice addition

I bought these shoes because I was tired of running shoes from other companies These shoes have been my go to for the past two weeks because they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had It truly is such a comfortable step each time I walk I took 23 000 steps yesterday in them and my feet felt just fine I am looking to buy more of these in the future

Worst adidas ever do not buy waste of money go with one of their other shoes

The soles of the shoes are super comfy as with all ultraboosts But I felt that the elastic at the top of your foot around your ankle the area that is pulling the shoe down was too tight I have to take occasional breaks Hopefully they will stretch out a bit

These shoes are rad Super comfortable and love that they are helping the environment

Aesthetically flawless Legend Ink color way is very classy yet understated Build quality and utilized materials are unbeatable Most comfortable sneakers I have owned However the fit is rather snug A half to a full size up is recommended Highly satisfied with this purchase

It is very comfortable and it is is the best color way i have ever seen

These shoes are comfortable quality is on point look good and draws everyone attention as soon as you walk in the room By far the best pair of shoes that I have ever bought and would recommend them to anyone looking for something that makes a statement yet is comfortable and breathable

They are pretty good I like the way they fit I will recommend this

I love these running shoes I also like the fact that they are helping the environment My entire family now has the Parley style

The Parley collaboration and the comfort made it an easy choice

Extremely comfortable shoe with great style Fits my lifestyle and reason for using this great shoe

They run narrow and about half size small but great show overall plus love they are made from recycled materials

I own 5 pairs currently browsing the site for the 6th Wide footer so went 1 2 size up Perfect fit then LOVE them

I like the shoe very much and would recommend it to friends

Nice shoe that came quick for a decent price Highly recommended

Toe box very cr and ed Difficult to wear shoes all day without sore feet Very tight across top of foot as well The sole is very comfortable though

Very comfortable great to run in looks great too

Absolutely awesome shoes for doing pretty much anything active or any work with lots of moving around Extremely comfortable supportive breathes very well I do not think any other shoe will replace this as my go to

I bought nmd r1 2 and ultraboost The ultraboost does perfect support rather than nmd r1 and 2 I really recommended you guys who have some foot issue to buy ultraboost as well

You just can not go wrong with boost

It was so light and comfy that I bought 3 more pairs for my family

I like the product for walking and jogging My feet have enough room and I never feel pinching on my toes

These are the best runners I have bought from Adidas yet Super comfortable and you can not lose with it being made from recycled plastic from the ocean could not ask for a better combo

I have 4 pair of these shoes that is how great they are That said and I do not know why but the Parley shoes fit even better than the regular Ultra Boosts I have two each I wear size 12 and the non Parley shoes are just little tight width and length for my liking so I end up not wearing them as much That said still the best show I have ever owned I wish I could afford more of them

The color the comfort and the durability can not wait for the next anniversary sure to come out to add to my collection

I have wanted to purchase these shoes for quite some time Always delaying thinking that the price was a little high for a pair of sneakers Glad I finally pulled the trigger These shoes are so comfortable they make all my other shoes seem like garbage Ultra Boost for the win

I owned 2 Ultra boast and tgey are really good and very comfortable I will try Yezee next time

Great shoes all around Really comfortable and versatile

These shoes are like walking on clouds and these specifically have the coolest reflective effect Highly recommend

I like this product because it fits perfectly on your feet and the air holes keep your feet nice and cool Also i like how it is a shoe that is in a way helping the environment

it is now just aethetics The quality comfort and materials are worth the purchase Not my first boost definitely not the last

Very happy with my purchase so far The shoes look even better in person I was worried they would be too dark but the blue looks really good They do fit snug but not in an uncomfortable way They just feel secure I am a bit worried about how long the tread will last but so far so good

These shoes feel like fluffy clouds beneath your feet Definitely worth the buy

it is durable and suitable for both males and females

I have been eyeing up ultraboosts for quite some time now and finally pulled the trigger on the parleys I was not disappointed These shoes are the BOMB They look great and are comfortable I have heard they run a tad bit smaller than regular boosts but I still ordered my true to size and it was fine

Love the style and feel of the shoe looks great with anything

Great balance and comfortable Would like to see the 3 stripes right below the tongue that will be cool Very cool looking shoes I must say

Comfortable for daily use especially for a college student who walks around campus much needed shoe

Super comfortable shoe that looks great with pretty much anything Not typically a sneaker guy but I reach to put these on almost every day

Great shoe very comfortable feels like you do not have shoes on

Looks great feels great I am already planning on buying more

soooo comfy and i get a lot of compliments on them

The color way is just amazing The blue complements the white very nicely And if talking about comfort WOW UltraBOOST beat out the competition by margins BOOST is the new way to go If you are not wearing boost you are pretty much walking on foam while BOOST are like clouds

they are pretty comfortable but they do not hold up with everyday wear White bottom section is peeling and does not look great The upper sections of the shoe look better however some of the nit looks bad sticking out Just not sure if they are worth the money

I really enjoyed the comfort and the aesthetics great tennis

Easy purchase comfortable shoe love the fit

Good quality probably the coolest shoe that i have worn and most comfortable

Extremely comfortable and light but also very durable

I wanted to add a Clima Ultraboost to my collection for the summer and when I saw this white Parley collab I had to get it The material feels slightly thinner than other ultraboost but in combination with the holes in the toe box makes the shoe super breathable great for wearing without socks Pictures do not do these shoes justice the blues in the upper and the cage pop so much more in person The nfc chip in the heel counter is also a cool little touch Every pair of shoes has an individual code and it says when it was manufactured It also gives you a link so you can see the process of how the shoes were created

There are my first pair of Ultraboosts Tried to purchase the non Parley model but they were all sold out in my size I had been having some lower leg discomfort running with the Adizero Bostons but immediately felt at ease on my5 mile runs in the Parleys

This shoe really stands out love the colorway Every shoe enthusiasist should own a pair of these

Best boosts I have purchased to date Breatheable and stylish

Love that Adidas is using recycled materials Need to see more of that as a standard

I initially ordered a size 14 my actual size in the ultraboost 4 0 and when I got it the shoe was way to small I had to go up a full size and I must say most comfortable shoe I own other than V2 350 The size 15 fit perfect I had never owned any ultraboost series til now and it is well worth it so if you wondering go up at least half size I went up a whole size and it is perfect

NEver buy the blueish gray ones because they are super ugly no joke Overall very comfortable shoes

Awesome shoes amazinly comfy and made from recycled plastic I almost wanna buy a couple more

this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and I love the way it looks

Confort and materials Can run and walk forever Will purchase an other pair

I bought this product with the intent to sell I immediately fell in love and could not sell them I now love to wear them and would recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of shoes

From the moment I saw the shoes while I unboxed the box I fell in love with them From the pleasant aroma to seeing the pure whiteness of the shoes it was i mean IS PERFECT

Gen 3 Comfortable shoes the support is not great on uneven terrain Had ankle issues when hiking Koko Head Great for inner city activity like work gym or running on level sidewalks Also the upper shoe or v and is easily un threaded Still most comfortable shoes I own

I was wondering if Im a size 11 what size should I get 11 or 11 1 2

Ever wonder what it feels to walk on cloudsBuy this shoe I will never buy another pair of shoes again if it is not ultraboost I hope they bury me with them

Undisputed comfort and styling Had them for 2x days and I have received too many compliments to list here The white is a nice shade of white and the Parley aqua comes through nicely Note that as these are Climacools the color of your sock will show through on the toe

This shoe is super comfortable and stylish I recommend this when you are going out with friends or family

These shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I owned and you will not feel tired or hot after wearing this shoe all day The 3M they put in the shoes are very nice hint to the style of the shoes and how they glow in the light They seem to be made out of good materials Overall worth the money if purchasing the shoe if you are looking to spend this much

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn that does not sacrifice good looks

Feedback from my son comfortable but very slippery during wet weather he has slipped couple times in his school

I like this shoe a lot and mostly because of how comfortable it is and it is ability to be cleaned I bought the white ultraboosts I believe they look the best unlike most white shoes the can be cleaned really easily

So much do that I bought 2 pairs and about to purchase a third in 2 weeks

I am on my second pair of Ultraboosts and they are definitely my go to shoe in my closet They are comfortable just wearing around the office and running and working out A couple of minor complaintsthe price prevents me from buying these more often I also feel static shocks more frequently in boosts but that might just be me Lastly the white sole on boosts are difficult to keep clean But none of these points will prevent from are buying

this is the most comfertable shoe in the world and thats IT gtgtgtgtgtgtgt 

These shoes are simply incredible They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I would truly describe them as bed for your feet Your feet rest on a thick soft and responsive bed of boost while being softly covered by a snug and supportive blanket of soft prime knit They are also very stylish Incredible shoes

It is really comfortable for walking long distance

Shoe was a half size if not a full size too large The shoe was incredibly tight around the ankle to the point where it was unwearable but with time that could possibly change I would highly recommend a different pair of UltraBoost before ever suggesting this set to someone else

Shoes look nice Wish they were made like the rest of the ultra boost I own when it comes to sizing

They are hot and everything I wanted I would recommend them to everyone

Very light and sleek a great modern style I loved them

Able to be out all day in a city and not have achy feet after

Its supporting getting rid of pullution and im all for it

most comfortable shoes ever like walking barefoot on cushions

Great fit and comfort for leisure wear or running or walking

Cut too small and narrow had to go to a local store to return and settle for a different shoe

Absolutely love these shoes Fit perfect The boost is super comfy They look great They are an all around win

it is really comfortable and perfectly designed for running They feel great but the cage gets scratched really easily

This is my 3rd pair of Ultra boosts and these are my favorite They are the most comfortable shoe I have put on my feet Keep it up Adidas I will continue to buy these

Debated this for a while but very happy with my purchase

I have another pair of ultraboosts but these are my favorite I bought these and wore them to Magic Kingdom Put 17 miles on them in 3 days of walking Zero foot ache and no back ache

Great shoe the most comfortable shoe I own and very good looking

Style and comfort sold me on this shoe It feels like you are walking on clouds

Stylish Comfortable Needed support comfort and a boost for my HIIT and cross fit workouts These sneakers delivered on all I have been a lifetime Nike wearer So happy that I have Adidas a try Try them you all love them

My second Ultra Boost LTD Both shoes are impeccable

Overall the shoe is a great looking and feeling shoe I brought the triple white model a couple of weeks ago and it still looks and feel good My only dislike about this shoe is that the left over glue residue gets stained with a brownish color that can not be washed out Hopefully someone can tell me a way to take that stain out

Shoes are really comfortable They are a good all day walking shoe

Extremelly comfortable and beautiful Simply the best to walk

I have always had great luck with adidas these shoes are the most comfortable pair i have owned

This shoe is the most comfortable she that I have ever owned I only buy Adidas now

These shoes look and feel great IF you order a half size larger My Adidas NMD and I 5923 shoes all feel a bit large in a size 9 but the Ultras feel incredibly tight I ended up going with a 9 5 and they still feel tighter than a size 9 in the other Adidas models

Comfortable asf they look cool and overall just a really dope shoe

This product is incredible I use these shoes for work where I walk 8 10 miles a day in them It feels like walking on a cloud They fit perfectly and are true to size I highly recommended these shoes to everyone

A great shoe to wear all day feels like walking on supportive marshmallows

Shoes feel tight Air goes right through and feel comfortable

These shoes are amongst the most comfortable things you all ever put on your feet I have had house slippers that were less comfortable

Feels very comfortable Best purchase for shoes ever that are high quality shoes

they are nice just too tight Not as cushiony as expected

1 2 size up was most comfortable but true size was best for exercise I am a 10 5 in all my nike adidas shoes and cleats For ultraboosts I really liked going 1 2 size up because the extra width made it more comfortable but a little too long at the toes Buying true to size was the best overall fit but just feels a little tight around the footarch area especially the sides and top of foot

I will decide after the stretching is completed the sizing on these shoes is inconsistent

most comfy shoe ever fits like a glove walks like a dove

So so comfortable and versatile Strongly recommended for walking around town or siting at home i still typically run in my nike pegasus

This is an amazing shoe that I think everyone should have The boost makes every step enjoyable and the ride is smooth as clouds The primeknit upper is very breathable and stretchy making the feel of the shoe even better The cage gives lots of support where needed and wraps around your foot for stability This shoe is incredible and after buying multiple pairs I just can not take them off my feet

I love everything the shoe stands for I bought it right after graduating college with a Biology degree because it just felt right and felt even better when I put them on foot

It looks great and fits amazingly it is like walking on a cloud

I am a nurse and walk 3 6 miles over a 12 hour shift First off shoe is noticeably a 1 2 size too small Even after sizing up the top of my foot is too tight but since it is a sock fit there is no way to loosen it I had a lot of heel and back pain trying to break these in but after 3 weeks the pain got better But I need good arch support from my rigorous work environment and although the sole is bouncy there is no arch support whatsoever None Good for young people with healthy legs but not for anyone else I am going back to my Asics Gel Nimbus

for money

I had these shoes for 3 days and thought they were the best shoes ever They are so comfy but the sole quality is awful They were great for normal jogging but when I was doing sprints the sole literally split apart

great purchase great shoe I love addidas merchandise

Very comfortable breathable and lightweight I have always been a fan of the Swoosh brand but thought I would try these out since I live my Adidas gold shoes I already bought another pair for when these wear out

 gtgtgtgtgtltltltltltltlt 

The comfort level and amazing sole perfect in my eyes

These shoes are incredibly comfortable and form fitting They are light and feel like I am walking on air Really awesome that these are made with recycled ocean plastics we need more companies making products like this 100 recommend buying

Like walking on a cloud Would definitely recommend this shoe

The material used is of high quality It is like walking on clouds when you are wearing it

I love it and would highly recommend it Easily the best shoe on the market

Amazing shoes fully recommended they are dope af and the comfort is outstanding

Shoe fit tts for me On this colorway the 1 0ish toe box is not as visible as others I really like having the light blue heel cup Comfort is boost so nuff said Hopefully get some brighter or solar colorways in the future Overall 5xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8 def recommend

they are so comfortable and I would buy these again

The shoes are so comfortable They are the comfiest shoes I have ever bought They fit well and they are very durable I have one pair that I have been wearing for about 9 months now and they are still in great condition I would highly recommend getting a pair

My second pair of Ultra Boosts and they are my favorite shoes

The downside about not having a separate tongue on the shoe is that the opening is not adjustable The shoe is very comfortable except for the opening which was so tight my whole foot started going numb I returned and went up a size still too small The next size up I would have been wearing clown shoes so I returned them and called it quits I guess I am not destined to be hip

I love these shoes they are actually my favorite I got the white and black pair the day that they dropped and I wear them every day However my left shoe is already coming apart it is really dissapointing because I love these shoes I hope adidas can do something to help me out

Overall I love these shoes 5 5 10 10 5 Stars etc The most comfortable shoes I will ever wear Be sure to go half a size up for this generation of Ultraboost I usually wear a size 9 I bought size 9 5 and they fit perfectly with the right amount of snug

Bought this as a gift and it was very well received

Great running shoes Very happy to recommend this product

I bought the shoe maybe two months ago I have only worn them about 5 or 6 times because the weather had been so bad in Minnesota and I have tried to take as good of care of them as I could but one day while taking them off I noticed a tear along the bottom of the shoe the boost had started to rip away from the shoe i was very excited about the shoe I have heard nothing but good things about the ultraboosts but very disappointed in the quality

This is my second pair of ultra boost and I am happy

Best shoe ever since I was born the best ultra boost

My first pair of ultraboost Very comfortable Now I understand all the hype about these shows

I like these shoes a lot Comfortable and well made The Ultra Boost shoes are narrower than the Ultra Bounce shoes So be aware of this if you order online

after 2 washes sole starts feeling off the material is poor too

I was missing something I walk a lot at work and with UltaBoost I feel I can do more Love it

I would recommend but very expensive Trust me these shoes are the comfy shoes ive worn but you start to get use to them very quickly One downside is they get dirty very quickly

They last for ever they are well made and all around great shoes

These boosts run a little large but other than that are very comfortable and look nice

Have owned the Triple White 3 0s for almost a year now throw them in the wash and are good as new Slightly small as a 13 feels more like a 12 5 but other than that very solid shoe

I just received these in the mail today and put them on for a trip to the store This is my first pair of ultraboosts but they will not be my last I am now a believer Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and easily the best looking I will be recommending them to everyone I can

Love this colorway and the 3m reflection pops with the ultra boost

Great energy return Upper is good quality even with recycled materials Environmental consciousness is a big part of these shoes but still very reasonable running shoes

These are the sickest colorway of Ultraboosts Nuff said

Most comfortable and lightest shoe I have ever owned

They fit like a glove and feel like I am stepping on a temperpedic mattress

The sneaker is ok not great Tight fit and I wear one size up always still tight When you taking off the sneaker the bottom pad comes up

Style and fit awesome So comfortable I wear them for everything

Runs small definitely go a size up Otherwise the shoe is great Would recommend

very comfortable and good looking shoe the color way is very true to the picture

They are like walking on air I wear orthotics and they fit perfect and wear perfect in the shoe

5 200 lbs and I walk on pavement The soles are split Fortunately the knitted uppers are in good shape and are stylish However I purchased for performance Adi check your design again

this shoe is amazingly comfortable the boost and the primeknit work perfectly to make sure your foot is locked in a really nicely padded I have not gotten the 4 0s yet but I have the 2 0 3 0 and the uncaged and I loved wearing them more than any shoe

Looks like a very comfortable shoes and I would wear it because it looks like i could walk for miles

Awesome shoe wish it came with a few pies of colorful shoe laces to add some flair to them

A bit on the narrow side but really comfortable supportive shoes

My wife purchased hers and convinced me to get a pair too Love it

I tried A whole size up and they still did not fit correctly I used to love the old fabric

He says they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned

The colors look good together The materials and the comfort of the shoe are terrific

A little snug but the cushion is hard to beat I recommend

Looking for light attractive multipurpose shoe for running touring and casual nights out to travel with small suitcase

I was always a Nike guy but these shoes changed me They are very comfortable and really minimize walking fatigue

If anyone can answer if the centimeter or two is okay in the front that would be amazing

I absolutely love this shoe It fits very comfortably and feels very nice to walk in Not to mention that they look very slick on your feet My only problem with the shoe is that the heel cup and cage came scuffed up out of the box which is very disappointing but I have not seen others with that problem so I think it was just a defect with my pair

Fit good I will buy another color ultra boost later

Very comfortable shoes and very nice I recommend this shoe

Wife says to me Those shoes better do the walking FOR you And with Boost it feels like they do Best sneakers I have ever worn and now the wife is getting a pair too

Absolutely amazing Walking on clouds Triple white FTW

Amazing amazing amazing and that is Alli have to say

I have owned these shoes for six months and they have been great until I kicked a soccer ball once On the first hit I looked down and there was a tear in the prime knit I am very unsatisfied at the amount of money these shoes are with the quality of the product I received

its good all around shoe and great for working out in

The shoes are great for running It fits well and is very comfortable

They are stylish comfy and go with any clothes you wear

Very light and comfy easy to put the shoes on and no laces needed it seems But it is little tighter on the width even when i got 1 2 size larger

Like this shoe very much but it was very snug in my size even thought the length was correct Would recommend going half a size up for wider feet

Tried them out after hearing so many good things about them Feels like running with clouds under your feet Sooooo comfortable

I love the style the ride everythingexcept the fit which is ridiculous I normally wear a 10 5 I returned those for an 11 They felt OK at first but wearing over the course of a a few days I have determined that the upper is too tight and they are compressing my feet I have never worn an 11 5 but that probably would have been more appropriate Disappointed after paying a premium for these shoes My Epic Reacts fit so much better

Love how the soles feel Very comfortable great bounce Needs more variety in design and color

High quality Quality and Profession makes perfect I liked the material and design It actually felt different this time as it suits my feet and comfort my pain I recommend all my friends to buy it its worthy Thank you adidas

Cons Price run slightly narrow even with 1 2 up white midsole squicky traction tongue not separated

Literally feels like you are wearing socks Extremely comfortable

NB is a more comfortable but this is still a great shoe

Looks good plus it is really comfortable The PK is soft and durable Boost is life

These shoes are ridiculously light and comfortable it is actu true to size but because I have wide feet it is a bit snugged on the toes Also perfect with thin socks I have another UB in 8 5 and they fit perfectly If you have wide feet go half size up But overall good quality and comfort

see more I like it more but it is not showen in different color and style

I like the comfort and feel Feels like I am running with well padded slippers I broke them in today for an 8 mile run and I love it If they were not so expensive I would get one in each color

it is the most comfortable shoe in my collection and they look good

Not sure have not worn them yet but if it is like all my other ultra boost I will love them

The store employees were fantastic and one of them recommended getting them half a size down these are my second pair after the 2 0s and sure enough the fit was perfect

Great shoe super comfy and helps the environment

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned I recommend to anyone looking to save their feet from Nike shoes

Very comfortable and light I can stand and walk on these shoes for hours at work

Style and comfort hands down I will not settle for less

I like it and it is very comfy and looks great They are a lot cooler looking in person then online and really pop with a pair of black pants I strongly suggest these shoes

Its very light weight and comfortable to your feet love it so much

Ultra boost technology is amazing for comfort and style Adidas is the best brand there is hands down

it is so comfortable and stylish can not wait for another release of Ultraboost

Comfortable and great style Would recommend this shoe

These are VERY comfortable sneakers I just got them so I am still getting used to them I generally wear Ecco Biom sneakers and I must say they are the best I have ever worn but these Ultraboost sneakers are definitely up there in comfort and style They seem to get more comfortable the more I wear them I am an Uber Lyft driver and one day I picked up an Adidas rep and we started talking sneakers I am a sneaker maniac as I love to walk and probably put 2 to 6 miles a day in walking My rider going a pretty long way convinced me to give Adidas a shot and I am happy that I did He named the Ultraboost and I wrote the name down These are so cool looking that I do not even want to exercise walk in them but only wear them around And they are so comfortable that I wear them around the house like slippers I own about 15 pairs of sneakers hope this helps

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Most comfortable shoe on the market If your on your feet for a long period of time its a must have No need for the chiropractor anymore

So comfortable amazing already ordered another pair definitely recommend

Feels like I am walking on clouds I need another pair to back these up

Love it I would have alot more if it was almost 200 for a pair

My son loves ultra boost and I finally bought him some caged They fit his high instep very well

it is a very good product I recommend adidas then Nike

nice shoes i like this shoes but when you want buy lets order with large size then

the shoes are supportive and very comfortable nice

These are fantastic shoes Helpful to the environment well made and supremely comfy My one issue is that the opening to get your foot in is much tighter than my Ultraboosts 3 0 Not a deal breaker and a have giant feet so this is probably not a common complaint but I at first thought that my true size was going to be too small untill I forced my foot into the shoe It seems to be stretching a little bit cause it is easier to get my foot in now but that is my warning to all wide footed fellow out there

Durable comfortable well worth the money I will be buying another pair for sure

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Trace of glue around the boost cushion fits well comfortable to wear

I love the comfort of the ultra boost These shoes have the best soles and overall feel of any shoe I have had

love it but would try a bigger size shoes next time

overall good purchase slightly narrow fit in front very comfortable

Easily the most comfortable shoes I own I have 4 pairs of Ultraboosts I have the 3 0 Burgundy 4 0 Ash Pearl 4 0 Triple White and now the 4 0 Cookies and Cream Easily the best colorway the black boost white cage and grey black white material looks amazing Looks great on foot

These shoes are crazy comfortable Never want to wear a different shoe again

Great shoe overall It was a little bigger than I expected But still a great product

These shoes are amazing The only negative I have to say is they are a little pricey but they are hands down one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I returned a pair of NMDs when I got these They have so much more support stability A completely superior shoe

Just look at this shoe how could you not love it

It is a nice soft and comfortable for diabetics too

Super comfortable easy to slip on and stylish

Love the color comfortable I would buy them again

I can not believe how comfortable these are and I love Adidas and once again they surprise me 10 10

The color way is so cool good purchase ultra boost never let me down

I own several pairs of Ultraboosts and they are all fantastic but these are the best looking and as comfortable as ever

All in all the price tag may look a little steep but you are really getting 3 different shoes in one with these I picked them up in a great neutral grey and plan to pick up more colors in the future I am officially a convert to the three stripes

This has to be most comfortable shoe ever manufactured for men

They are the best shoes I have ever purchased My feet hurt for a days after I started wearing them I think it is because they are not used to that much support Once you break them in they are the most comfortable shoes ever It feels like your walking on a cloud it is also really fun to stand and move your weight from one side to the other and watch the cushioning squish

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I received them as a gift and it was the BEST gift EVER They are awesome shoes Highly recommend I am a woman and got these shoes

Top lace hole wears and breaks easily within just one month of nominal use

I bought a new ultra boost shoes and Adidas sent a used one The tracks on the bottom had dirt embedded into it One side of a shoe was ripped You can also see that in the picture

Love them I had the sole professionally blacked by my custom on IG guyv a because I do not have the time to clean

My son loves this show very comfortable Was more than expected

Awesome shoes and the most comfortable I have ever wore

These shoes made running feel so easy The level of comfort they provide is unreal I have really flat feet and they add a level of comfort like I have never felt Working out with them is so comfortable you will not know unless you try them on Already looking to buy another pair

These sneakers look identical to the picture online and they are a perfect fit with a great look Love them

Extremely comfortable great support and fit Excellent stability The only th8ng I would change is the color of the laces to match the accent color of the shoe

Another great color way Same great shoe I would recommend to anyone

It goes with any outfit and it is really light and it is just dope

So comfortable to run Good option for the runners

I love this shoe they are very comfortable and a good quality

I like the comfortable feeling when wearing them Plus they look pretty fly

Because I wear these or my other pair everyday Comfiest show out there

Extremely comfortable great fix and very stylist My go to sneaker for the gym and weekend

best brand and very nice design will recommend it for daily use and during work out times

Got the green grey with white heel cup color scheme They look incredible and being ultraboosts they are extremely comfortable Sexy sexy shoes

Can get a full workout in now without losing circulation in my feet

Dope shoe Very good shoe to walk and sport around

Very comfortable and good looking My son likes these and will purchase more

Love your products but very disappointed I have had to send to pair of my favorite running shoes back due to faulty shoelace loops on the shoe They break making it impossible to lace them all the way up Two pair have been sent back

Very comfortable great for running though not such much for cross training

Great running shoe I love how the shoe is reflective when the lights hit them

Love love love these shoes I want one in every color

Very comfortable if you are on your feet for extended periods of time

Love the comfort Only problem i had at first was the cage felt alittle chocking at first but fixed up my laces and it allowed for a little more room around the sides

So comfortable and stylish Can wear with anything

Very comfy and comfortable I like width because of my bunion Though pricey

I have a sneaker collection dating back to 1988 with well over 150 Nike Adidas New Balance etc and Ultraboost are still by far the comfiest shoes I have ever worn Hats off to Adidas for implementing this amazing technology into such a clean silhouette Also not that it matters but Ultraboost are head turners when it comes to style You WILL get complements on these when rocked with a dope outfit trust

I like the shoes because they are super comfortable and advertised as said

Awesome material They are 3M reflective which gives them an extra flair

Looks pretty good right now if it had a black boost it would look pretty sick

I would definitely recommend these shoes to everyone looking for comfortable shoes

I love these shoes they are extremely comfortable and stylish My only complaint is that the caged part gets marked a little too easily but its not too noticable but is a little annoying at times

Great running shoes as well as for travelling Very comfortable

great product smaller than previous version which made it uncomfortable to walk

Bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them I recommend this product

they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and I recommend them

Should buy will not regret the purchase of the price

I have had 2 other pairs of these but i can never stay away from them especially the new 4 0 model super breathable stretchy comfortable and overall amazing

High quality and very comfortable Minimal shipping time

I love the Ultra Boost line however the 4 0tend to run a little bigger than previous models

These feel supportive through long runs and are still great for tempo

Another quality Adidas product Appropriate shoe for 5k fitness runs I would recommend this shoe

These are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought I have a wide foot so its a bit tight but other than that they are awesome



I have a pair of ultra boots and liked them so much I just ordered another pair

provides a good combination of support and comfort but the boost tends to get dirty rather quickly Overall good product and would totally recommend

it is really like a sock and comfortable a really good shoe to wear anything you want

The untraboost is light but also sturdy enough to feel stable in It does not matter what I am doing i feel locked in and ready to go in these shoes

These are great quite possibly the most comfortable shoe on the planet

light very comfort and I never feel i wearing shoes

Comfortable and very light weight Also a very good looking shoe and I wear them practically every day

So comfortable highly recommend it I have bought theee pairs since my first

Small things but hey when you spend this much on some shoes you would nitpick

It runs a bit small so you might wanna make sure But great product and very comfortable

It is an amazing running shoe I also have the encaged version which are also nice

3rd pair these are everyday for sure Adidas

I am a nurse and on my feet all day No other shoe has been this comfortable Will never go back to any other brand

Bought the shoe because of its comfort and high recommendation But do not feel it has enough style and option Pretty simple looking to me

Worth for the price spent and Best suitable for running on any kind of terrains

I bought the Ultra boost 3 0 17 days ago and the Continental tread as show abnormal wear considering I only walk in them just 22 miles so far

For his qjality and look and price And all the commodity and my boys like a lot Adidas

Besides the price product is the best shoe purchase I have made

It is super comfortable in the primeknit upper is really breathable great for all day wear and casual wear

Bought these shoes for my son he loves them there true to size very comfortable and would highly recommend

I needed the comfort because my feet do not have arches so most shoes hurt to wear for to long but because of the boost I have yet to find a problem with these shoes

Very comfortable at this price I would say it is hard to say something bad but they are almost a liability now on my feet haha

I like the shoe it looks nice and feels nice The sole looks mushy but feels firm I am 190 lbs 5 6 and my feet feel great after wearing them all day Kind of tight around the feet but sill feel ok NOT thick sock friendly would buy again in different color scheme

Shoe is awesome and would tell anybody to buy Love it

A friend bought one of this boots and it looks and durable

Not a driving shoes My achilles tendon hurts on multiple occasion when I drove for just for 3 hrs I have to accustomed to breaking in my own car due to very soft cushioning Boost So in the end these shoes will be my trunk while driving

unique love the color ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe ever

Really comfy shoe and super stylish it goes with everything

It is comfortable

Shoe is uncomfortable if worn more than an hour or standing for a long period

This is no doubt my favorite shoe I own multiple pairs of ultraboosts and each pair just make me feel like I am walking on clouds Adidas really nails this product in the head For running best shoes I have ever run in hands down And it does not hurt that they look dope Overall a great shoe

I love ultra boosts I always have two pairs in rotation One of the reasons I need two pairs is because of the mesh tearing unexpectedly This can be annoying but it is a small price to pay for the amount of comfort and possible use out of the shoe

Like walking on clouds and that is all I have to say about it

One of the best shoes I have ever owned Fits perfectly

These are expensive but maybe the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

Simply the best sneaker I had ever owned Will not buy any other brand Addidas Ultraboost ROCK

This is easily the best pair of shoes I have ever purchased

Really comfortable on the basketball court and walking around too

Best purchase and excellent running shoes I recommend it 5 stars plus for those that run all the time and even if you only just walk

Great Color way Comfortable and stylish shoes Shoes are great with every day ware

great bounce it adds to your step width is a little snug for me

Unbelievable quality incredible comfortability best sneaker ever

As I said this running shoe is certainly the best I have ever used My only problem is my different size feet One is a twelve the other a half size bigger Other than than this shoe is outstanding

Very comfortable very stylish a little narrow I have wide feet

Most comfortable shoes I own Definitely getting more

Shoes are comfortable and very well made and look great on

Very late to the Boost scene but these are the most comfortable pair of shoes I own I wear them mainly for lifestyle Purchase was hassle free and shipping was fast Went true to size and they fit perfect as long as I do not wear thick socks Can remove the insole if I need more room Thanks Adidas

These are extremely comfy and feel like a sock Great for running and great for style

The size and comfort is a amazing Perfect shoe for working out or just casual wear

They are very comfortable and the cushioning is exceptional However they run small so order 1 2 size up The main gripe with adidas is that their shoes are inconsistent with their sizing across their different sneaker lines The sneaker itself is amazing once you can find the right size

Its very nice and comfortable Espicially for sport people

the comfort is awesome especially when i run long distance the best running shoe i ever had

Perfect fit Remember to size up half a size Best shoes to wall around on

color is bright and works well with different styles

Love these beautiful shoe very comfortable need to double up

So good to walk in love them Worth the money Buy them

Most comfortable pair of shoes that I have ever purchased or worn

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I highly recommend this shoe

Great because making use of recyclables Unique shoe

extremely comfortable shoe One of the best shoes I have purchased

The shoe is amazing I previously had Alpha Bounce shoes which were already great but these are one step further up Get 5 size bigger than what you regular wear they run a bit small

It is very comfy and the quality is wonderful When I put them on i felt like i was on clouds

1 2 a size too small slightly narrow in width maybe get 1 2 larger than you are used to

Overrated and overpriced wish I did not purchase them

does not have the comfort as my current style ART BB3931

Love the look unfortunately can not Wear with seam digging into the top of my foot

Bought 2 of the same pair just in case Adidas never has a perfect sneaker like this again Best sneaker I ever owned

Did not like yellow logo so sharpied that out but love the shoe overall

Tried suggested size 10 1 2 which is a half size larger than my actual size It was still width wise to small Although uncomfortable the cushioning was remarkable

Look great and feel even better Perfect for everyday use

I loved wearing these shoes for about 3 weeks until I noticed I had less and less support I checked the shoe and the prime knit upper began to separate from the midsole To add to the fact the insert inside of the shoe has started peeking away I loved these shoes until the quality issues appeared

I can not believe these shoes are not sold out Not only does the 3M design just POP in the light but the overall feel and look are top notch do not sleep on these shoes I do recommend going half a size up especially if you have wide feet

Not sure if words can describe the utter comfort this shoe delivers Not only does the shoe deliver in comfort the multi colorway is visually stunning in hand My pair had the perfect amount of orange in them giving the shoes a subtle yet noticeable pop

Love the comfort True to size was too tight around top of the foot Gave me red marks that demonstrated that it was cutting off circulation Ordered 1 2 size up and it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

Had been eyeing some ultra boosts for awhile and finally pulled the trigger on these and I was not disappointed These are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and the bonus is they look amazing

its a nice and stylish shoe its also very comfortable

Good quality

I like the product simply because it already looks comfortable on the feet and makes one relax more and makes your feet nice and comfy especially to jog it helps with tough turns on the jogging trail which makes it a good and strong traning shoe

I can not find a complaint Everything checks out You cannot go wrong with a pair of Ultra Boost

Best shoes ever These are so comfortable I love that these are limited release as well

The best shoe i try so far i could sleep them on

The 4 0 ultraboost is the pinnacle of comedies and style My favorite of the boost I have gotten And an improvement on the 3 0 which I also loved

Extremely comfortable My favorite everyday shoes

The best shoes on earth there is nothing that I can compare to these shoes Thank you adidas for mowing my days at the gym better by my feet never hurting Perfect shoe worth the money

The comfort of other shoes does not even compare to the Ultraboost Honestly the Ultraboost is hands down the best product I have ever bought

Very comfortable shoe and the black color is amazing

Amazing shoes comfort is insane per usual Awesome colorway on this one

Adidas continues to kill it This shoe is amazing

Comfort although quite expensive Worth your money and I recommend

I am buying up any and all boost products The cushioning system can not be messed with This is my third pair of Ultra Boosts and my 6th pair of shoes featuring boost

The most comfortable and best looking shoe I have ever purchased Oh yeah and the most expensive as well Thought it was going to come with some extras for that price

I like it because it is comfortable and amazing for running

Big fan of the ultra boost shoe love the fit and comfort

Loved the over look and comfort The stripes strikes again

Works well for outdoor and indoor distance running I logged in 30 miles since buying them and the comfort is on another level

I am a 200lb runner with flat feet I wear size 15 in most shoes but I can wear a 14 in these They look amazing They feel even better When you slip these shoes my first thought is wear have you been all my life I just purchased in a 5k with a time of 19 12 and recently did a Half Marathon with several different terrain The boost held up perfectly They come out of the box ready to go but once you break them in my goodness I have logged 7828 miles Running in these shoes make running even more exciting As a personal trainer I recommend these to all my clients They are the best

Yes it is comfortable and looks nice its not to expensive

What I did not likea bit expensive fits a bit snug so I sized up 5 and limited quantity

it is Lit These sneakers are some of the best from adidas in 2018 IMO

Like the product Just the white part on the sole looks kinda cheap but its comfortable

like them run a little small apart from that they are good

Great shoes very comfortable perfect fit feel like slippers

Quality shoe wish it was a little cheaper Around the 125 150 price would be better The comfort and quality backs up the steep price I walk 10 miles a day and use these for my work shoes and they work great

I purchased these for my son along with shoes for his two sons He said the shoes were awesome

These shoes are like wearing padded socks The primeknit material is stretchy and feels strong and the detail of alternating white lines is really cool especially in the sun These look awesome on my feet

I like the way it looks It feels really comfortable and is a good fit

perfect supper comfortable The best shoes i have ever bought

My son loves all his ultra boost He is 64 and weighs 240lbs Comfortable shoes are not always easy to find He loves them

This is just the most comfortable shoe ever made feels like walking on the clouds and when it is night time it is the bomb as I get a lot of nice compliments cos my shoe makes me stand out

I have three pair of the 4 0 and two pair of the 3 0 I have a normal size foot and both versions fit me true to size I noticed on the core black pair it suggests to order a half size up but I ordered my true size 11 like usual and they fit perfectly I will say that the primeknit on these 4 0 versions is not as stretchy as the 3 0 and because of that it is a more snug fit but these shoes are supposed to fit snug and a half size up would be too big for me I recommend you order your true size and if you want a less snug fit you can always remove the insole It makes very little difference in terms of cushion with or without the insole

I like the color and that they are very comfortable

I like the product because it looks really cool and it feels very good on the feet

Really versatile with the cookies cream color way

i love the product but i would want to know the color on the screen when you search up alter boost

I really Like the overall look and design of the Sneaker Paying homage to Oreo cookies and being released on national Oreo day was a cool idea The colorway is perfect and the cookie mixture of the prime knit shows there was a lot of attention to detail in releasing These The comfort of these UltraBoost is bar none as comfortable as ever so I definitely suggest getting these if comfort and style is on your list of things you are looking for in your next pair of kicks

My first pair of ultraboost and many more to come I have a a bunch of Ghazals in the past but these were well worth

Very comfortable shoes I am on my feet all day I walk itleast 7 miles a day at work and these shoes have been excellent

The shoe is the most comfortable I have had The colorway is also very distinct and I receive multiple compliments

These shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and they look amazing Everyone keeps asking me how I got them and I have to tell them that I stayed up until 2 A am for the release but it was well worth it The quality of the shoes are definitely top notch and this was easily the best shoe purchase I have ever made Well worth the money

Possibly one of the comfiest shoes i have ever owned

Super comfortable but had to buy a half size too small because of low selection at store

weightless crazy comfortable look great I work out in them and just out and about Also great for running on the beach

Best comfortable shoe ever highly recomend any boost shoe

I bought these shoes for my boyfriend because his gym shoes were looking really ragged He says they are really comfy and easy to walk in Good for at the gym but he would not use them outdoors on like turf or grass

Great look good length but narrow at the top Removing the insole helps or wearing it barefoot but is a problem with thicker socks

Very comfy shoe and stylish Just sucks trying to compete with bots just to get a pair

It is very comfortable but the size is misleading its hard to purchase shoes online and it was frustrating to not be able to see them in the store I returned them

The ultraBOOST is one of the comfiest shoes you can find while expensive they make up for in it cloud like comfort and great styling and colorways

This are the most amazing shoe Gonna be hard to beat going forward Only regret is I can barely wear them because there to hard to come by in cookies and cream

Ultra boost sets the bar for comfort and of course for style too

Ultra boost without the insoles are the most comfortable lifestyle shoes to date

Love the pattern on the Cookie Cream colorway It definitely pops

Comfortable and stylish I very much dig Boost technology

Perfect style way comfortable and can enjoy them all day

Absolute best shoes I have ever owned Only shoes I will be wearing for a while

Use to wear different brand of shoes so took some time get use to them But once my feet got acclimated to them the shoes feel great and fit perfectly

Primeknit upper is soft and pliable as you would expect and in this colorway with the dark grey painted boost foam and spotted upper hides dirt well

Not only is it extremely comfortable it is very aesthetically pleasing Definitely would recommend buying

Great shoe really comfortable looks dope and I have got lots of compliments on them

Most comfortable shoe I wore definitely worth it to buy

The 4 0 UltraBoost are a little snug in the toe box if you go your tts for UBs but they do loosen up after a days wear I stayed with my 3 0 sizing and it worked fine for me The 4 0 colorways are a little bland but there are some like the cookies and cream that just pop If you have not tried Ultraboost for whatever reason get over it and put on a pair

Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Unmatched comfort the most comfortable shoe on the market hands down

The foot support throughout the whole shoe is insane Just bought a pair of yeezy 700 boosts too and they are comfortable but not as comfortable as these UB

The shoes look better in person and are very comfortable

I like the ultra boost the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn

I almost did not buy this pair Glad I did just prefer the grey and black look

And keep in mind I use this shoe as a lifestyle And not really a runner

Overall it is a great shoe Good response to running and working out Very comfortable and I am happy they went with continental for the sole

Love Ultras as always just wish Adidas stopped releaseing so many and make it more limited like before

The most comfortable shoe out in the market and the aesthetics are show stopping

Awesome addition to my UB collection Like the color and the story behind it

Looks nice and very comfortable Need to add more pairs Easily sold out

Second pair of uktra boost purchased and I love them A great shoe

Color way is dope ComfortWell you should know by now boost is life

Love the color way comfortable as expected glad I was able to get a pair since it sold out fast Love it

Comfortable Cool looking Great color Very light

Perfect everyday use shoe Really comfortable for running

Not a huge bike fan anymore NMDs come close but I still think this is possibly the greatest shoe ever made The colorway helped sway me into my purchase as well

I have bought two pairs of Ultra Boost Probably buy more

it is an Ultraboost Will always be super comfortable

Very comfortable shoe with great arch support Fits like a glove

Great shoe great colorway Like walking on a cloud

I purchased this shoe to wear all day long as a lifestyle type shoe The shoe has a nice clean look and the boost midsole is fantastic I have a high volume foot and the mid foot felt a bit tight at first but with some lacing adjustment all is great I highly recommend this shoe

I love the Ultra Boost 4 0 they are super comfortable and the quality of the material is superb If I could afford all of them I would buy them all

This is my 3rd pair of UBs so I am familiar with the comfort and fit and feel This pair however has a really eye popping color scheme with the black boost material and oreo primeknit

I was fortunate the be able to get the Oreo 4 0 and I am very happy The color schematics goes really well Of course the comfort of the Ultra Boost is ever reliable and consistent Not much to say I am just happy to be very lucky to get these specific shoes Thank you Adidas

You can really never go wrong with the UltraBoost This colorway really pops and goes well with workout running clothes or just black jeans My dad loves the ultraboost for running he already has the 3 0 oreos and so I bought him a pair of these as well These are one of my favorite colorways of the 4 0s yet

Size is a little off but love the look of the shoe

Got them as a present for my boyfriends birthday and he loves them He wears them all the time and tells me they are the most comfortable shoes he has worn

This is my 6th pair of Ultra Boost Love the design and comfort

Hard to find a performance shoe to fit my abnormal feet profile but from the first time I put these on it felt like they were produced just for me I would recommend these to anyone and say they run very true to size Excited to put them on every time I look at them

I love these shoes They are stylish and super comfortable

Comfortable and lightweight Great colorway and very clean

As great as always Adidas can not be touched best shoes best company

I like the ultra boost because of its comfort and looks The shoe is the most comfortable I have worn The only problem I notice is the ventilation

Super commfortable as usual Great look great style

The shoes not only look great they are equally as comfortable

Besides some glue stains on several areas shoes looks and feels amazing Great lifestyle and running shoes

I love the style and comfort of the shoes Cookies and Cream is my THING

I am a fan of the Ultra Boost series I have no complaints of the shoe

Best shoe purchase ever Comfortable shoe that fits well True to size

Comfort and quality best shoe would recommend

The translation from comfort to quality is seamless it goes from browsing the shops to tread milling Hop squats and back to a stroll without a hiccup personally this shoe should be prescribed to me to treat my plantar fasciitis these shoes level the playing field They are in the same catagory as sos toothpaste wateru2026 they are a Necessity

I like it cause they comfortable but I got them half a size smaller but they stretch so that is the good part of it

Extreme comfort and the look is perfect Favorite shoe I own at the moment

They do live up to the hype Very comfortable and head turners for sure

Most comfortable shoe from adidas Leading the industry in comfort and innovation

They are very comfortable and stylish You forget you that you have sneakers on

Looked great but glue marks around the cage were very noticeable on the primeknit

Super comfortable and look great I was able to get the cookies and cream release

Sizing with adidas can be hit and miss I bought 8 5 and they were a little bit tight around the mid sole I was lucky enough to purchase the Ultra Boost Cookies Cream on the day they released I absolutely love the charcoal Boost I have only worn them once at the gym and I am looking forward to breaking them in a bit more

Most comfortable sneaker out there today With the 4 0 pattern it is a most buy

Best shoes ever would buy them again Softest shoe on the market

So usually after I am on my feet for a long time they start to hurt I recently bought these shoes and happen to be on my feet all day I was just waiting for my feet to start hurting just like every other shoe I have owned Never happened A bit pricey but my comfort and feet are worth it Thinking of buying another pair in a different color Highly recommend these shoes

Perfect shoe for everyday use It is very comfortable and durable

it is a pretty good shoe but fits a little narrow and half a size small but overall it is very comfortable

Love the prime knit and love the boost material Very happy with the purchase

The colorway is amazing and is of course the most comfortable shoes in the market

I was always an originals fan going for a more classic look with sneakers After trying Ultra Boosts on I find it hard to wear anything else Pricey but well worth it Amazingly comfortable

I have been wearing Adidas Sambas for over 7 years I just never imagined that there was a shoe that could replace it Until I discovered Ultraboost Wow I liked it so much I got another pair Cookies and Cream

it looks good and I see the quality is on point as desired

These shoes are comfortable stable lightweight and fit like a sock They are worth every penny I do not think I would ever regret buying another pair of ultra boost

There is no words to describe this UBoost except PERFECTA

I have had over a dozen knee subluxations where knee pops out of socket and goes back in and throughout the years my knees are for sure more susceptible to pain I can truly say that the boost in these new 4 0seriously d and en the pressure on my knees from walking and running My family does not wear shoes in the house but now I do because they are literally more comfortable and less pain to walk in than without I also use orthotics but that is also to help me knees

I bought these shoes for my husband and he loves them He cannot take them off of his feet He says it is like walking on clouds they are that comfortable Also he loves that they are not too tight

I bought the legend ink colorway and it looks absolutely amazing I am not sure why a lot of people are saying to go half a size up or down Personally I got my true to size in UB which is an 11 and it fits me perfectly Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable pair of shoes

Comfortable light and they fit like a glove

These shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned

This is my first pairs of ultraboost and I love it

Love the way the product looks and feels once on but they are not the easiest to slip on or off because there is no tongue

the fit is perfect they have a great bounce to them that make them really comfortable to wear over long periods of time

I bought the shoe to be on hard floors in the operating room 12 hours a day where I walk 3 5 4 miles a day The shoes are great for 8 10 hour days but not enough support for 12 plus Besides that it is a great shoe Bought my first pair of adidas in 1970 to play basketball in Nice comeback for the company

I had to buy a size larger Shoes are supper comfortable and stretch with you feet Great support

Very comfy and they look nice too Definitely would recommend

This shoe is very comfortable Looks great And is a nice Shoe

can not go wrong with this shoe best ultraboost so far

High quality very comfortable not accessible to all feet unfortunately

Honest opinion the way this show fits is not to big or bulky it is a clean solid look which is what I really like most about the shoe I got the core blacks and they are a perfect black shoe I was looking for The shoelace to the knitting is perfect and pretty soon I am going to buy another pair of all whites

I love it It feels super comfortable and I can wear this all day long without feeling tired on my feet

Sooooo comfortable this sneaker is the best for your money when it comes to comfort

Greatest shoe ever adidas for life Will be buying another pair as soon as possible

Good product overall arrived within 3 days fits welk comfortable but concerned about waterproofing

The Ultraboost is incredibly comfortable light weight and has superior support Seems to run a bit small so I suggest upsizing one size for a normal male foot Maybe a half size for a narrow foot Great quality shoe I will buy more in different colors

This is my first Ultraboost amazing I used it whole day at work gives me an incredible comfort The best highly recommend

Extremely comfortable and stylish Perfect for everyday use and training

My son loves these shoes they are very comfortable

Best of both worlds comfort for running and fashionable for casual wear

Comfort level is very high on UB The colorway is a plus

Style and looks great for working out or running The colorway goes with types of attire

the design and quality on this shoe is nice and clean

I have dealt with foot pain all my life due to a genetic disability I was never able to find a shoe I could walk in without issue I got a recommendation from a friend to try UltraBoost and it has been a miracle shoe No more foot pain Not to mention how stylish they are Thank you so much Adidas

You must try on a pair to know how comfortable these are Money well spent Try a pair and see for yourself

These shoes are definitely expensive but as someone who has to walk around very often it was a very good investment to make They are extremely comfy and the 3M technology makes the shoes look very stylish as well They take everything great about UltraBoost and just improves on the look

Unfortunately compared to the last pair of UltraBoost I purchased last year these are too tight Tried to wear half a dozen times but they do not fit

I recently had a foot injury where my ankle and foot swells and I have a hard time finding shoes that will fit without being too loose or too restricted These shoes are so great for that because they are so customizable with how tight or loose you need them to be I can have one shoe looser for the injured foot and the other normal for the normal foot One thing I will say is that they are a little big in length However it really does not bother me They are light breathable flexible and the soles are like walking on clouds I highly recommend these shoes

I love the design and color scheme It is also very comfortable and light weight

These ran 1 2 size smaller than the 3 0 I would advise sizing up But they are so beautiful especially when the lights hits it

Another pair of ultra boost Comfortable as always and this one just looks good so I had to get them Glad I did

Ever since buying a pair of Ultraboost 3 0 I have not worn any other shoes besides dress shoes I am glad to welcome the LTDas my second pair of shoes that has Boost technology

One of the best shoes that adidas make the ultraboost are for daily walk

I have many Adidias boost shoes nmd primeknits etc these by far are the most comfortable and supportive can not wait for new colorways to purchase

I have tried this for a week and I when I go back to my old shoes and now I can not go back

I have this shoes in black and I have tried using this shoes for box jumps and I can feel the pain on my forefoot and knees when landing I do not get the cushioning hyper or shock absorption technology benefits and it actually feels much worst than most of my other running shoes I probably would not recommend this as an official running shoes to my friends as a casual walking shoesyesbut not as a running shoes

Very comfortable shoes and look great Buy it do not think about it Definitely the most expensive sneaker I have purchased but the comfort makes it worth it to me

I love this shoe on how simple is looks to how much little detail there is when you really get to looking at it You just can not go wrong with this pair of shoes Highly recommend them to anyone

Most amazing tribute to the original Boost shoe The 3m throughout the shoe is amazing The prime knit as always is top notch A Adidas I am picking up a second pair before my review sells them out

Love the product great feeling and great fit and all the color opinions One request is can yall please make a color opinion limited edition or something that is carolina blue and black that has design of dark mocha but just replace the mocha color with carolina blue

Perfect fit feels light as a feather and incredibly flexible while maintaining support Whether I am putting in laps at the park or the grocery store Ultraboosts will be my go to kicks

So comfortable and quality really good Good design shape

Not sure why I waited so long to get these shoes The most comfortable shoe I own

it is great you will not be disappointed it is amazing how the boost line pushes back with each step I will be getting more I wish I could give all my friends and family the gift of boost

Best 4 0 Yet The woven in 3m is toooooo sick A must pick up for the BOOST Fan

Love the product It is the most comfortable shoe I own it is top quality and materials and a great fit so far for the first week

These shoes look great and I have gotten plenty of compliments on them I could still wear them all day just like other ultraboosts My only issues I think the 3m causes the knit to not stretch as much so it would probably be smart to go a half size up Also of all shoes to have either a grey or black midboost these would have been it I hope there will be more non white midboost shoes released

I liked it because the shoes design was very unique I likethat it was not completely black and I love how they light up I would say size down maybe a half size but no more You will really like this shoe

comfortable shoes good for running and nice looking shoes

Good shoes not a big fan of design on 4 but 3m is really nice

The comfort of the shoe is as expected It is very nice looking and feels great to walk in

Perfect shoe I can not wait until more come out Love the boost technology

The ultraboost is the most comfortable sneaker ive owned I have multiple pairs and will continue purchasing them Only gripe i have is the previous boost models where more stylish Boost 1 0 2 0 had a better balance of color and aesthetics Hopefully adidas will retro them

Very comfy and durable great shoe for everyday use

You can never go wrong with the ultra boost

I love the product being a consumer of boost has changed my motif on adidas But now what only comes to mind for any future products is what is next

very comfortable great for working out will buy again

By far one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned Currently have 3 0 triple whites and 4 0 core black Love the product definitely recommend

Very happy with my purchase the 3M reflectiveness really pops

Comfortable looks good I am using these for running

Shoes are really comfortable and fit me well Love 3m too

Love every incarnation of white ultraboosts except the third Glad to see this one incorporate 1 0 elements

This product is amazing The 3m material is so unique and beautiful when it shines The subtle black when it does not on top of the great stripes Only other coloway that I think can compete is the new grey mints

Wanted to try some ultraboosts for a while tried on the 3 0 in store and fell in love with how light they are and how you can feel the squish from the boost sole

Great shoe Attention to detail Make sure you protect I can see these getting dirty quick due to being all white Great addition to Collection

I can not believe these shoes are not sold out yet

The look of the shoe is greatam an aggressive power walker up mountains and the support is great for both uphill and downhill stretches

The boost is incredible and the knit upper is second to none

The ultraboost 4 0 is a set up from the 3 0 Boost feel is the same as the 3 0 but the primeknit molds to your foot better which adds to the shoecomfort Go TTS as the fit is perfect on this model This version has 3M stitched within the primeknit so it will reflect when it is hit by light

My complaint is with your website the online photos were poor could not plainly see the item colors or weave Thought we were ordering a completely BLACK shoe received Grey exactly like last pair ordered Disappointed

My second pair Most comfortable shoe I own and I am a tenny shoe fanatic

The title says it all This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

In two words Love Them Highly reccomend for running and casual wear

If you have not taken a look at the pair you are missing out

These are the most comfortable shoes ever I am a nurse and they are perfect for 12 hrs shifts I would recommend these to anyone who is on their feet all day Keep it lit

This is another great ultra boost and the 3m makes this one really stand out I am glad I made this purchase

I love ultraboost They are the best shoes ever and most comfortable shoes ever

I originally started my ultra boost collection with the EQT 93 17 These are slimmer but still comfortable and feel more fitted than the EQT Which at times can be a little wide I have a wide foot so these fit true to size even though I wear a 12 in converse and a 14 in the EQT and these Ultraboosts

The boost was not as soft as parley ultraboost Probably needs to wear more to make the ultraboost soft

Good for everyday use I got all white so I am a bit scared to get them dirty but oh well

I walk about 3 miles a day due to my job and these shoes by far are the most comfortable to walk in I highly recommend these shoes to everyone

Easy to wear very versatile Perfect shoe for walking to the store and walking around in all day

Looks amazing but overpriced The 3M and yellow accents are a nice touch

Fits better than my darker colored boost and more comfy than my 3 0 Might need an extra pair

Great shoe Comfortable and a sleek look Everyone should try them

Needed a shoe for walking the dog So comfy but everybody knows that already Best shoes ever invented please do not change

The quality is amazing and the comfort is there for a sneaker at its price point its worh every penny

I went with a 9 5 in the 3 0 ultra boost They would not fit me whatsoever Now with the 4 0 it fits perfect for people with wider feet

These fit like pair of socks and just as light The way they form around my feet is quite comfortable Being 54 comfort is welcome especially with the accompanying style of the shoes

best pair of running shoes I have ever had and also couple as a great casual sneaker price is steep but i have two pair now and love them still more than ever def worth the price

More or less a impulse buy no regrets looks spectacular

The most comfortable shoe i have ever worn i would recommend this to a friend

It is the most comfortable Adidas shoe no scratch that The MOST comfortable shoes I own in general I have worn it for the like four days straight

Take the inserts out and they are my favorite shoe to walk or stand in have not ran hard in these yet but on a light run these are legit Noticed a lot less pain in the back and knees while wearing these for long periods on my feet Thanks adidas

I love this colorway especially the 3M hits and the two toned cage but I do not understand why they are priced at 40 more than a standard pair and 20 more than other LTD colorways For the price I at least expected extra laces or a fancy box Other than the inflated price I love the colorway The 3M hits are crazy reflective in certain light

These are off da HOOK Very cool stylish comfortable light weight and goes with everything The entire Ultra Boost shoe line are all so stylish that you can wear them anywhere dressed up or anywhere in between

They are comfortable shoes with a sweet style In addition to the comfortability they have the reflective speckles Sweet shoe

Love the colored heel cup Def my favorite colorway in the 4 0

I love these shoes Actually feels like you are getting boosted forward with every step More comfortable than the nmds for sure Although these babies are expensive they are worth every penny Would recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable stylish and durable shoe

Like all my UB these are by far the most comfortable sneaker on the market I workout in my UB However due to my step  and arch I cannot run long distances in them These are a great fashion statement and gym shoe Highly recommended

I received what I paid for a beautifully made pair to Adidas keep up the great work My closet now has equal Adidas to Jordanthat speaks for them self

So as far I am concerned the 4 0 is another excellent edition to the ultra boost family And as with every shoe there are pros and cons it is got a great fit good styling very lightweight and comfortable But will the thinner prime knit hold upFinding the right size can very by foot type and not as comfortable as last edition So far I have really enjoyed my 4 0 and have made it my most worn shoe The slight difference in comfort from my 3 0 is a worthy trade of for the better fit and lighter weight of my 4 0 To each their own

I like the color the style but most of all the comfort

You can not go wrong with an ultra boost They are very comfortable and stylish I would recommend them to anyone I know

Most comfortable shoes I own Every generation of the boost series have seen big improvements

Love the shoe the covert style really makes it a bit of sleeper shoe that becomes so much more once light shines on it with the 3M built in A must have for your stable

love the comfort love the fit true to size and love the aesthetics

I love the material and the overall comfort with the shoe it is a great shoe

The Boost cushion gives my foot the most comfort I have ever experienced in a shoe before The Continental tire rubber sole is extremely responsive I can feel the grip every time I walk I look forward to using them for a 15k i have coming up in March

Awesome purchase great shoe and colors This was a great shoe indeed

The shoe runs too small and narrow I buy size 9 5 in most brands this shoe was too small and narrow Had to return it

They are comfortable but they have got muddy and dirty even though I have cleaned them multiple times

I love it it fits so great I wore it everywehere

Excellent colorway of the Ultraboost 4 0 They look darker in person as in the pic the cage looks white in hand The cage is actually a very light grey Lots of Black peppered throughout the toe box All in all they look excellent on foot

I love these shoes the 3m is so reflective and looks so dope when in the right lighting and you can never beat the comfort of an ultra boost These shoes are a MUST BUY for any SNEAKERHEAD

I love the addidas ultra boost line this shoe is super comfarble and a great looking shoe

First pair of Adidas runners I would buy several more Ultra boost if they had more better colors Great shoe I have never met anyone that owns them that feels any different

I am standing all day at work so I needed some very comfortable shoes Ultraboost are very light and comfortable After a long 9 or 10 hour shift my foot does not hurt like with other shoes

I have owned two pair of the Adidas Boost The first pair broke down withing 6 months where there was a slit from side to side on the ball of the sole a good 1 2 deep I sent those back and got my money returned I bought another pair and they started breaking down one month in By six months I threw them away because the slit was so bad I have never had this happen on a pair of shoes before They are super comfortable so if the sole could be redesigned I would try them again

I ultimately choose to return these shoes because I found them too warm I live in Southern California and it is only February but it felt like I had snug fitting sweaters on my feet

Very Stylish and clean looking shoe Ultraboost is the most comfortable shoe I ever owned

Ultra boost are the best shoes ever Like walking on clouds

Thank you adidas for sending me free shoes and gear if you would like to send me more free shoes and clothes to review get back at me

Cool enough to wear casually and functional enough to wear to the gym

Very Comfortable and good quality I have plantar fasciitis and this shoes helps a lot

Too expensive for a pair of ultra boost that has no major difference from the other colorway Besides this colorway is not that crazy of a looking for it to be cost 40 more So NO I will NOT recommend buying this 3M stuff sneakers just for the 5th anniversary hype

Love the new primeknit they have and the new pattern is great for breath ability

very comfortable and looks great size is accurate too

Shoes run small I am a 12 should have gotten 12 5 I would suggest go a size above

So comfortable and really great shoes to wear daily

My second pair They feel great even a year later They never lose their comfort

I wore them to work for a 9 hr shift the first day I got them I would not recommend that as they did take at least 2 days to break in You can feel the boost as soon as you put them on I walk on tile a lot at work and notice they do squeak quite a bit Overall I like them and would get different colors This was my first ultraboost purchase

A

Comfort support and quality is superior to anything else

This is my second pair of ultra boost I have a high instep and they are the most comfortable shoes

ConclusionIf you are buying this shoe as a day to day shoe I would 10 10 recommend it will give you the best walking strolling experience you can get from any shoe in my opinion Also they look awesome on your feet while doing all the great things a shoe needs to do But if you are looking for a good running shoe I would try these out before buying them for that reason because you may be disappointed

Expensive but worth every penny The blue carbon colorway is exactly what I was waiting for

We had the product less than 2 weeks and already my sons shoes are falling apart sole is seperating from shoe

The LTD Ultraboost is the best ultraboost ever made

My son thinks this shoes pull his roommates all like that too

These shoes are some of the best overall shoes I have ever had I use one pair at the gym I attend the Air Force Academy so much of our time is spent working out because they offer a perfect balance of strength and rigidity for lifting as well as great comfort and support for running and cross training I bought a second pair to just wear around because of how much I love the shoes and how great they look with our PT uniform if I am just walking around indoors

it is a great shoe A little pricey but it makes up for it When you first put on an ultreaboost it is like walking on clouds it is very nice The only thing I noticed is and maybe this goes away after a few times of wearing them but after hours of them on my feet the tightness of the shoe was making my feet ache a bit But other then that it is an amazing shoe and I would definitely recommend it

The ultraboost is amazing It is meant for a running shoe but we all know it is more of a lifestyle shoe Not only does it look good it is the most comfortable shoe out The boost reacts and responds well

The shoes has good cushioning Being a wide footed person it wraps around my feet perfectly

My son loves these shoes He says they are comfy

Comfortable reliable and best for the money vshhdsh heyday hsbshhs handhelds shbxbvy

The quality was excellent as always but the shoe size was way to small The shoe was sent back on 2 5 2018

The shoe is very lightweight and comfortable I always feel like I am walking on clouds Perfect

This is a great shoe and I thought I got the wrong size the first time since my heel kept slipping Tried on the smaller size different color at a store fit perfect So I exchanged it for the color I did want but my heel is still slipping It seems this model is a little different than the other Ultra Boost listing that does not talk about having wool in the fibers Not sure why this one fits different in the heel maybe it is just me but hopefully I can find a color in the other style that I like because the shoes feel great just do not want to worry about my heel moving

I read every single review before purchasing these shoes They really are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had Thank you Adidas

3nd ultraboost shoes I bought it is a bit tight in width but leave a small space on my toes Overall they are fine

Bought this for my son for Christmas He said it is the most comfortable shoes in his collection HE is very happy with it Best part my sons surprised me with my own pair on my birthday And gotta say now my favorite pair as well Well done Adidas

It is a very comfortable shoe I will recommend this shoes to a friend or family

Super comfortable great design Love Boost will buy again

it is supppperr comfortable and effortless when walking

Stylish and comfortable super easy to wear with anything

Very comfortable good looking shoes Noticeable boost in energy of your step when walking or running

These seem to fit a little tighter than the 3 0 but maybe they just need to be broken in Love the ultra boost Best shoe I have

4 0 is already the best UB Now add the throwback colorway for the EnergyBoostCopped

I am so glad Adidas did major improvements on the Ultra Boost I have the original black and purple Ultra Boost and loved them Versions two and three were painfully tight in the forefoot and toe box Version 4 Ultra Boost is much better and takes the fit of the original and steps it up in a positive way For me personally there is significant more toe box and forefoot room There is added boost on this model which gives an incredible return which helps me run for longer periods of time I just wish the Ultra Boost LTD was not so expensive Overall great runner

Had to get this for the Anniversary pack EXPENSIVE

This is my very first pair of Boost shoes They have only arrived today so I can not say much about them other than the fact that they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Extremely good looking also

that is good shoes

Ultra Boost are simply thatthe most comfortable shoe ever Whether for just everyday use or for running you will not go wrong with a pair of Ultra Boost

I was a little hesitant towards the price but after getting them and being able to wear them Best shoes I have ever had

Once you won a pair of ultra boost you will not want to wear anything else

Comfort unreal definitely slept on during release Glad i copped and sick colorway Swapped the neon laces for black for a more lowkey flex

they are super comfortable and fit my style i recommend them

Shoes do not fit like other adidas I have and they look stupid and gaudy on my feet

Excellent product it is really comfortable and a very good design I only wait to get the Yeezy beluga to complete my collection

The shoe is pretty comfortable but the 3 0s are more comfortable The upper could be a little thicker I am my opinion too But still an all around good shoe

I work as a nurse aide right now and walk an easy 4 to 5 miles every shift I used to wear NMDs and they did not provide enough support and would come home with extremely sore legs and feet Now with ultra boost I have no pain

Tradition all the way back to my high school days in the 60 

Fantastic shoes Most Comfortable pair I have ever bought

I love this shoes are so comfortable and looks really cool

Not the best looking shoes The white version also got dirty very quickly

Finally got my hands on the hypest color way of the ultra boost Ultra boosts are legitimately some of the best and most comfy shoes on the market and in my opinion cannot be beat Best shoes in terms of comfort and appeal I can not recommend these shoes enough

Amazing shoe that I highly recommend The size ran a tad small on my pair but not enough to exchange it Maybe go up half a size to be safe

I got these shoes and loved them They are great for running and doing all the active stuff you do but i have had the for only two months and they have already started to rip Just wish these shoes were more durable

If adidas made a wide ultraboost that would be perfect Feels like walking on clouds but the plastic cage hurts the sides of my foot because I am a bit wider than normal

Great heel support and comfortable fit A very nice running shoe If you normally wear a 10 order a 10 5 US I would buy another pair

The shoes are very comfortable I would buy again

Very comfortable I would reccomend to others I would definitely buy another pair in a different color

Amazing pair of shoes only problem would be it is hard to clean if you get the tripple whites other than that amazing comfort and quality

GOOD QUALITY SHOE PLEASE START MORE MANUFACTURING IN THE USA

Title says it all I recently purchased 2 pairs of Nike Roshe Flyknit 2and returned them both it is tough to see myself going back to anything other than these now

These shoes look and feel great Perfect for anyone

I love the look and the feel of the shoe it is the most comfortable shoe I have

There super comfortable and very worm for winter the rubber on bottom holds up very well

Overpriced for the quality Spend my entire birthday money and not satisfied

Sweet shoes Get compliments everyday Super comfortable

Product is perfect for casual use Not so much for actual running

I am a crazy fan of this shoe I started getting into shoes last year and since then I have only worn boost I have had 3 pairs of shoes in the past year and the best is by far the UltraBOOST What can I say about this shoe it is so insanely comfy The huge boost midsole combined with the Primeknit upper makes such a comfy fit This and the super padded ankle area AND molded heel counter makes it feel like you are walking on a cloud

Huge fan of ultraboosts and these ones look even better in person

They are comfortable and they fit really good around your foot

This is my 5th pair of UltraBoost but my first pair of 4 0and they do not disappoint I personally think that the PrimeKnit on the 3 0is just a little bit more comfortable stretchier but this is still very comfortable and I love the look I have received lots of compliments on them already

Let then stretch a little and they will break in nicely

Extremely comfortable running shoes These shoes are highly recommended for long runs

I love these shoes it is a great lifestyle training lifting and running shoe all in one

Beauty for 2018 is the last word of beauty and wonder other other

I have always liked the ultra boost line from adidas When I saw these on shelves I was surprised because these are a really nice pair of shoes They are really comfortable also They also go with most things Style wise

My boyfriend recommended this shoe to me and i bought it thinking he was joking about how comfortable they were but when i first put them on i was very surprised you feel like you are wearing a sock and walking on air no joke

They fit my feet very well I like the color too

I love these shoes because they fit perfectly they are so comfortable and that is exactly what I was looking for

The shoe fuzzed after the third time I wore it but other than that a good shoe

The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a new running shoe or just a casual day to day shoe

I own 4 pairs greatest running shoe I ever had It is comfortable especially in the heel cup area Also love the colors to natch my workout shirt and shorts

Ultraboost 4 0 has a clean look new pattern and most of all comfort If you have never tried adidas boost you are crazy

They seem to run a little narrow but by far one of the most comfortable shoes I have owned

i like it because it is very comfortable and a good lifestyle shoe

I have been a huge fan of the Ultra Boost since 1 0 Althought I desperately need a new pair I cannot bring myself to purchase again based on the color themes with the 4 0 Where is the colorWhere is the excitementBRING BACK SOME COLOR

4 0 Primeknit pattern best ever Gray Color Great A tiny 1 4 size small maybe but not a big deal

The Parley Ultraboost is my first ever Ultraboost purchase and I am very happy with the comfort and quality of the shoe They do fit tight but I had to order a 12 5 cause they do not make 13 GR I took the sole out and have 0 complaints 1 of the best shoes I have ever bought I will be back for more

Very stylish runner that matches its comfort The white blends in with any outfit making it easy to match

I love this product So easy to wear and match with and super comfortable and can wear them all day

it is too expensive Not affordable The quality is not that different

Its get heavier after a few miles of your running

Adidas All day everyday If you want a shoe that you all love these are them

True to size and colorway looks great Will recommend this product to friends and family

Walking and runnings feels very good You can actually feel the boost working for you

I love the way they feel on my feet they so comfortable

Shoe has everything you could ask for But the price was set by the hype of a new product

it is the best shoe The other boost models are still great But the ultraboost is the one

It was recommended by my son It fits well and comfortable

Thanks for making a 14 Hard to find that size Love the looks and comfort

For the money I expected so much more they should feel great the moment you put them on

Yes yes I am yes because yes and yes I do yes because yes

I bought these shoes for my son as a Christmas gift and he can not stop telling me how much he loves them

Great durable shoe Comfort level is superior Nice feel around the ankle with great support my son is hard on shoes so this is a well invested purchase

it is very good and comfortable and it feels like walking on clouds

Feels like I am walking on clouds By far the most comfortable shoes I have ever own Bought them in both black and white and coming back for more

Looks good very comfortable Uppers too soft near no resistance so feels like your foot is sliding off the sole

Shoea are comfortable to wear The color is nice and can fit any color for your sports outfit

Although the shipping took a lot of time the shoes look really good and and are extremely comfortable totally recommend

The cushioning on the Ultraboosts are extremely comfortable the shoes are stylish and they are very durable

very well made beautiful design very excellent comfort could be a little wider

Extreme comfort Now I will never purchase another casual shoe

Shoe color way looks great Red is not orange this time But Quality is trash

They run a few sizes small would recommend but try them on first

I love this product because it is such a comfortable shoe and fit great The only problem I have is that the plastic scuffs easily otherwise greatest shoe

After 5 years with same running shoe different brand switched these and have been

It was a gift Size is small so currently still in the process of returning If the returns goes well I will purchase again

Very comfortable and clean I like the 1 0 looking arrow pattern on the toe

Boost is amazing design is too nice dark burgundy is the way to go it was love at first site

I love everything about it the way it feels he size the way it looks it is overall a great shoe

High quality and comfortable shoe Recommend a half size bigger than usual Maybe a full size

Quality is great and it matches it good with daily wear as well

Shoe size runs a little large for me Overall a great shoe

First if all this shoe is very comfortable when working out The addidas ultraboost are also very nice and catches alot of people eye

Extremely comfortable with solid construction I will wear these everyday

very comfortable sneaker probably one of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned

The Best Running shoes you will ever have worth every bit of a

The cage is translucent looks brown sometimes and scratches easily Not any great filtration and the feet get warm easily

As a New Yorker and athlete I am always on the lookout for a comfortable durable shoe I settled on the Ultraboost and was not disappointedthe shoe is very comfortable when both walking and running offering support and cushion I purchased a half size down from my typical 9 5 to a 9 and it is snug on the sides with a bit of room on the toe Would recommend

Really comfortable shoe I would recommend to anyone who likes to walk on clouds

christmad gift for my Grandson he obviously liked the shoes his words were they are awesome I wear them everywhere 

I had pure climaboosts before these and I assumed since they both had boost and were adidas running shoes that the sizing would be the same but it was not so A 12 pure boost fit me perfectly whereas my 12 of ultraboost is too narrow I do have wider feet and so that is why but the ultraboost shoe is much skinnier I would not change the shoe next time I will get a half size bigger but I can not this time cuz these ones sold out too quick

Best shoe ever comfortable great for running or just wearing

Very comfortable durable matches with any outfit

My husbandfeet always hurtuntil I bought him these They truly took all the pain away and he feels like he is running on pillows

I have read many reviews and have looking into ultra boost for a while now and everywhere said they are amazing I finally got a pair and they have a sew line or something that causes a welt sort of thing on the top of my foot and massive amounts of pain and makes the shoe awful I am not sure the direct cause but the shoe has some sort of major error and hurts to much to withstand I do not know if it is only my pair or if every pair has this but I wish I spent my money elsewhere

Awesome style and awesome fit Got many compliments wearing the shoe

Style and comfort makes these sneakers better than others

The prime knit is a little tighter which gives it a little more support

Perfect shoe for those who stand walk or run alot

Ultra boost has definately reignited my passion for sneakers and the limitless comfort in a great looking shoe I am excited for the future of comfort that Adidas will bless us all with

love the shoes Everything i am looking for wish they were more true to size

after only one month the eye lit ripped in half so mad

This Christmas present was a hit My son loved them

Love the color way and look of the shoe My foot is wider than average Wish there was a way to customize wider feet

Comfort is out of this world It was just awesome ask anyone

These shoes are the most comfortable ones I have ever worn They also look extremely nice Would highly recommend them

Purchased Ultraboost sad gift Recipient loves it Delivered as advertised Would buy again

Ordered these for my husband as a Christmas gift He loves them

Ultra boost is very comfortable I would buy the shoe again

This is the best shoe I have bought I want them all

Very comfortable Best shoe purchase ever Worth the money

The UltraBoost 4 0 took a shoe i thought could not get any better UB 3 0 and improved it in every way i could not even see The knit is softer and firmer than before it hugs my foot and once again the boost is absolutely impeccable No shoe rivals this in the least

These shoes are absolutely great The boost provides great comfort on your feet

These are the best fitting shoes I have ever worn My old shoes I xef xb8 x8f wore everyday

The boost is so nice This is my first pair of adidas as far as I can remember at least The shoes are the most comfortable I have ever had and I have already got 2 pairs of the 3 0s and I plan to continue collecting them and cop multiple pairs of 4 0s

These shoes are very cushiony I have bad feet but with the Ultra Boost my feet never hurt I will be getting more of these shoes

My feet get sore and blister easily these shoes solved that problem like walking on a cloud Highly recommend

My shoes white came looking used The soles were dirty and the insole wrinkled My grandson cleaned them before he even wore them

1 Could you get them any more whiteLol these joints are foreal white For some reason I did not think it was going to be as white as they are The roommate loves them perfect size perfect comfort perfect color way combo

I love these shoes And I think everyone should have them

Very stylish and comfortable The color is very nice

They are super comfortable stylish and all around the best shoes I have ever had

The shoes were for my husband and he is very picky with his shoes because of the comfort and look and adidas made those shoes perfect the comfort is amazing and the look is on point

Fit my son perfect said his favorite xmas present this year

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned perfect for running or all day use

After wearing them for eight hours it seemed they were cutting off the circulation on the top of my feet This was with them very loosly tied Keep in mind I am 5 11 and 180 pounds so my feet are not fat However my first pair that are the same design do not do this so they just need some breaking in I assume Boost for life

The most comfortable sneakers I have ever had The best invention

Very comfortable shoe exactly what was thought of product Great shoe

The best most comfortable shoes in the world currently Holy Grail of sneakers The most prized pair of shoes in my possession

I purchased these ultra boost back in August and they were by far the most comfortable shoes I have worn However after only going walking these last 4 months the continental brand web tread wore out quickly and underneath the soles cracked tore I believe this to be a manufacturering defect since I have owned much cheaper shoes and worn them longer without the cracking or tear in the soles Again these are incredibly comfortable but sadly did not hold up

so light and so fast so light and so fast so light

It feels amazing and it looks amazing it is good quality

Son loved the way the shoes looked and felt Overall loved them

It is very easy to slip your foot into the shoe It feels snug around the foot and even though i keep the laces loose the shoe hugs your foot and wraps around it comfortably I have not walked in them for a very long time while wearing them but from what I can tell they are very comfortable in general I also like that the upper material is able to flex but is not as flimsy as the 3 0

Had heard about the Ultra Boost hype but never worn a pair Had a couple pair of NMDbut the UB is wayyyyy more comfortable Definitely recommend

My son loves this shoe He owns a pair of Pure Boost and is over the moon to have these Ultra Boost Extreme comfort

All good best boost yet Lines are much sleeker

They are comfortable and they fit me perfect The colorway of the shoes are so cool

Very comfortable Fast shipping Good quality Will purchase again if needed

Well made and very comfortable for walking or running

DOPE af I Love these and they make me happy I was very depressed until I found these but now i can finally live a care free life style MY dude these sheits are fire and totally worth the cop

They are super comfy they have a clean look to them

The ultra boost 4 0 are very comfortable and have a great design

SVINTBOOST on twitter adidas group career is my dreeeam

Bought as a gift for a sneaker head and he was happy with them Good looking shoe

I have nearly every boost product and by far these are the most comfortable shoes ever

The adidas 4 0 is by far the best as far as comfort and design I am am very happy with my purchase my only suggestion would be to go a half size down so it can fit just snug around the toes if you stay true to size you might feel it a little loose around the toes where it would feel like you have clown feet

My teenage son loves these shoes Very comfortable and stylish

Very Comfy shoes would buy another colorway next time

Very comfortable shoe The only problem i have is that it was a little big

You can wear these to almost anything but the white gets dirty quickly Overall shoe does not rip and the boost stays the same

Highly recommended and very comfortable son loves it

Son loved them for Christmas This was one of his favorite gifts and he was excited

I like the shoes because its very comfortable good quality light weight and it feels like your just wearing socks

Super comfy shoe I love the color way The quality of the show is excellent

Ultra Boost are amazing for women and men I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas who typically wears a size 12 in shoes I knew he really wanted them so I went ahead and order the 11 5 They are a bit tight but he still loves them He typically likes his tennis shoes lose but these look great and he loves how comfortable they are

I purchased two pair for my grandsons They love them

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I xef xb8 x8f love them

love the product wish they had more interesting colors

I have wanted these shoes for awhile and received them The size 14 fot as expected Very comfortable and stylish Love the boost and primeknit combination

Bought these for my brother for Christmas He loves it more than he loves me

The shoes are awesome The maroon color is very cool and be dressed up or down They are very comfortable as well

To say these shoes are comfortable would be an understatement

my son said they are really comfortable and would buy them in every colorif he could

My nephew wanted these for Christmas and he has great taste The were perfect

This was for my 17 year old but now my husband wants to steal them Best shoes he said he has ever owned Super comfortable Def recommend well worth the money

Great quality Shoes are a comfortable fit I will be purchasing another pair in the near future

product good but not worth the price especially for teeneagers

From the cushion to the fit this shoe screams comfort It fits snug without being too tight and the material breathes great Not to mention it just looks fantastic

Got this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend We went off the Adidas sizing chart which said a 8 5 would fit him perfectly but actually ended up being too small Boyfriend is typically a size 9 So now we have to exchange for a size 9 Lol Basically these shoes run true to size and I would not follow the sizing chart Just go with your typical shoe sizes

Slight changes But maintains classic look and great comfort as usual

Most comfortable shoes I have bought and so light and breathable Awesome work adidas

Good shoe only slightly small around the middle width wise but I have wide feet so that might just be me

Got my son these for Christmas the bomb as he calls them Best gift ever

Great shoe definitely lives up to the hype extremely comfortable

My son loves them They are exactly what he has been wanting and he was not disappointed

i like these and the boost is perfect butvapormax4lyfe

The product is great shoe Great comfort and just looks great overall

I like this product for its stability it provides during my HIIT cardio training Comfortable material cool mesh keeps my feet dry Torsion system has great surface adaptation and provides support for both forefoot and rear foot

Ordered my normal size and my toes were smashed in the toe box very comfortable boost sole

Most comfortable shoes ever perfect fit Great gift idea

Prompt delivery of a sized and colors hard to find Expensive but worth it

The Ultra Boost is the best shoe on the market period Whether you are looking for a fashion statement or a true running shoe these are the ultimate

I am a Physical Education teacher and on my feet all day Thee shoes help me get through the day in the most comfortable way possible

I do not use these shoes to run in but it is great that if I am lazy I can wear these with gym shorts and if I want to dress good I can wear them with jeans and still look and feel great

The new pattern for the knit upper grew on me to be honest The ridge like pattern along the sides really stands out and is different than previous versions However the upper looks and feels thicker and better quality than before because of the new knit material

Soft and light weight and if fit him well for being a size 15

1st Pair of Adidas I have been a long time Nike and jordan guy for over 35 years Also have a few pair of Cole HannThese are by far the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn

This is one of the most stylish and comfortable shoe

I absolutely love these shoes They fit great Look great Have outstanding comfort

For the price I paid I would have expected better quality out of the ultra boost

I like It it is very comfy but you get holes and your laces become torn up very easily

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and love the look

I struggle with finding good shoes that fit me My left foot is a 14 right is a 15 and i went with some 15s here this time Its like walking on a cloud No chafe spots great support everything i could ask for in a shoe

This has taken over the top spot of my boost collection I thought the my EQT 93 17 would always be the comfiest pair But i was wrong UltraBOOST is King

I love the product because it is quality I will buy it again in a diffent color

These are the best shoes ever So comfortable and so stylish Wish the price was lower

I like the style of it although as someone who wears 9 5 it feels squished when I got them in 9 5 The top of my foot is constantly red after I take them from wearing them from at least an hour

The most Comfortable and supportive shoe I have ever bought

love this shoe i do not run in them just wear them casually every day the 4 0 primeknit on the grey remind me of the primeknit on the1 0 which is AWESOME

Super fresh Love the boosts like walking on clouds cliche

Very comfortable soft and light price of the shoe is a bit expensive i need to get pick on next yeezy relase

do not get me wrong these shoes are sick The colors are amazing and I would definitely recommend them The only thing I did not really care for was the comfort This is my first pair of ultra Boost and I thought they would be a lot more comfortable I have a couple pairs of NMDand in my opinion the NMDare more comfortable Thank you adidas for the sick releases and keep it coming

The 9 and a half seems a tad long and at the same time the fit around the upper foot was kind of snug Once I pulled the soles out the fit was perfect

Love these shoes Just do not understand why sizing changes with each version You may want to 1 2 size up unless you like your shoes tight even when you

Super comfy One of the most comfortable shoes I have tried on I use to be an avid Racer and Free connoisseur but this shoe is crazy

it is very comfortable but soon it starts to appear holes on the shoe

Great design Very comfortable Excellent quality

Ultra boost 4 0 is great and the new colorways are amazing Love the new patterns on theses shoes

I like the product because it is very styled at this time I would say it is hyped

Love the boost Great fit Feels comfortable to walk around in

I like the new 4 0 feel but I wish there was more colors mixed in like the 3 0

So i owned these shoes for about a month when they started to get roughed up First of all i gotta say these shoes are REDICULOUSLY COMFORTABLE I love the noise boost makes everytime they step However i have to say that the plastic pieces on the shoes did not hold up well The plastic got scratched up very easily and then one day when i went to tie my shoes the cage just snapped I do think though that for the comfort i would buy them again and just be extra cautious

it is as if you are walking on clouds great pair of shoes and are aesthically pleasing at the same time

Easy to wear with anything and the most comfortable shoe on the market

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Own 4 pairs and can not stop buying

comfy

Runs slightly bigger than the 3 0 but other than that I feel this is one of the best Ultraboost models Prime knit is thicker and breathable Overall I give this 9 10

I have a few pairs of these already and they are the best Finally added these to the mix

Would buy a hundred of these if I could comfortable

Sizing and comfort are top notch My first time buying an adidas shoe and I am very impressed

Very comfortable and sporty but stylish at the same time

Even with wide feet the PK has enough give to make these comfortable The boost sole on these are a league ahead in terms of comfort compared to pureboost and NMDs Will buy another

Comfort quality stylish and performance Would buy again and again

Very Nice and comfortable The colorway is also very nice

Son wanted them as a Birthday gift I would not buy them as an everyday purchase I think it is really crazy to spend that much on sneakers Needless to say he did not get anything else for his birthday

it is comfort like no other sneaker out there Great for casual wear gym lounging around the house it is amazing For a swole guy with size 13 feet these are great for my workouts and just going out

Amazing shoe my first pair of ultraboost actually but runs a little small I am normally a size 8 so I got a 8 5 thinking that would be enough room but it was not Go at least one full size up if you do not wanna deal with returning the shoes

The shoes look blue online but once I received them they are more green Turquoise

Get 1 2 size larger I was debating to get 1 2 size smaller because everyone says ultraboost runs large But I decided to get true to size and they are a little tight

Love the shoes only hitch is they run a little big

So comfy this this all the flaws from the 3 0 2 0 1 0 to make the perfect 4 0

The Ultraboost 4 0 sizing is perfect the boost torsion system primeknit continental and everything about this shoe is awesome It is the most comfortable shoe I have wear

Bought the 3 0 and love how comfortable for walking But I would not run in it because of heel slippage and the outsole wears out so fast Since the outsole is make from winter tire material it is soft and grippy but wears about fast I have had it for about half a year and I am about to no rubber in the front of the shoe But love how comfortable it is and wish it was cheaper

Great quality product Very comfortable and perfect fit

Comfort I do not understand the required words

Yes the best quality of shoes that to wear nowadays

I like this shoe because it is very comfortable and stylish

Should have gotten 1 2 larger comfortable but size 1 2 up

SIZE TOO NARROW NO COMFTY WASNT EXPECTED SIZE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER MODELS

Color is even better in person Very happy with my purchase

Very comfortable Good looking shoes Come in a little smaller than advertised Ordered a nine and they are more like an eight and a half

Super clean super comfortable super stylish YUHH

I found one problem with these ultra boost and that is while running it is so hard to turn corners because the upper sole does not keep my feet steady and therefore i have to slow down and turn so that i do not risk injury So any lateral movements is limited with these shoes Also not good for any lateral plyometric movement at the gym i learnt the hard way But Overall an amazingly comfortable and multipurpose shoe for everyday style walking or straight runs

Fantastic shoe quality with the best comfort Will buy another pair in the future

The cushioning spring back and fit are amazing The quality of construction and materials are impressive Excellent breath ability but warm enough for winter walking

these are incredible they fit better than the 3 0s

One of the most comfortable shoes I ever owned and have 0 complaints But the colors on the website are kinda hard to see as i got the core black looks much lighter in the daylight I am a 9 5 in pureboost and a 9 fit perfect for the ultra boost 3 0

Most comfortable shoe ever Absolutely recommend these shoes

My feet is wide so I have to order 1 2 size bigger it is comfortable but tight on the arch

These are easily the best sneakers I have ever owned They look even better on your foot than they do in the photos and the comfortability is through the roof it is a kind of supportive comfortability that does not feel like you are just sinking into some cushy foam

The shoes are the best comfortable and look pretty sweet too

the most comfortable shoes I ever had in my life I will definitely recommend it

High quality comfort What could be betterA basic everyone must have

Got the new triple white 4 0 Ultra Boost in and they look really good I like the black bottoms on them and the new pattern is dope They fit a lot more true to size then the 3 0 so I would not go down half a size just stick to your true sizing Comfortable as to be expected If you do not already have a white pair of ultra boost I recommend

Great shoe but why do we have to enter the drab color phase againAdidas please provide some color options

LITERALLY takes ages to find my size but Adidas pulled through Now I got my size 15 Ultraboost

Very comfortable and sturdy running shoe Great feel and feels great to run Cushioning feels great

unstable response technology shortens your stride to increase transition for those who weigh over 180lbs this shoe will damage your feet

I first bought pure boost last 2016 in Japan and i love it so i decided to buy these ultraboost and it is very comfortable for two months i use it 4 times a week Now my third Boost are on the way the ultraboost uncaged I did not get a chance to finish my order when the time Ace 16 was launched and I am hoping soon there will be an available size for me

I have flat wide feet with no arch so it is extremely hard for me to find shoes of comfort in which I typically would wear sandals But weather changing and sandals are not the best for feet I needed good shoes I was skeptic with Addidas at first And thought they looked funny but I was wrong soo comfortable These shoes are pricey but worth it it is like a tempur pedic for your feet

So I have 3 pairs of NMDs and 1 one pair of ultraboost 3 0 But the 4 0s are a game changer for good

This is my 4th pair of ultra boost and I love them all Comfort is unmatched by ANY other shoe on the market boostislife3stripelife

Boost is super responsive and fit is more true to size than my 3 0

UB has been one of my favorite silhouettes and version 1 0 as my all time favorite because of the knit pattern I purchased UB 4 0 because it has some of the UB 1 0 pattern with additional parallel lines running from toe to heel which I am not a fan of To me that ruined the otherwise perfect pattern It would have looked cleaner The pattern reminds me of the NMD bedwin cw and I absolutely hate them

It has great comfort and they are so light with such great fit on the ankle

As a flat footed person its hard to find shoes that can be comfortable all day My foot pain and knee pain has almost disappeared The kicks are so comfortable I rather wear them around the house than just wearing socks

This is my fourth pair and I am really happy about it Best shoes i ever had

These shoes feel like Jesus is kissing your feet with every step

The Best and most comfortable sneakers I have ever had my entire life Love these Just need more different colors

A must purchase Most comfortable shoe ever worn

My son loves them and brags about them so enough said

Design is eye popping

love the Ultraboost lineeach generation gets better and better If you maintain your boostsit will certainly last a white

I am flat footed and have fairly wide feet so I was reluctant at first to buy a pair of shoes that were slightly narrow but as soon as I put them on all my worries were gone The Ultra Boost is probably the most comfortable shoe that I have ever had on my feet The comfort and support that the Boost sole provides is groundbreaking I never used to like running until I bought the Ultra Boost

Hands down the Ultraboost line smashes every other sneaker I have worn I am on my feet 12 hours a night and the 3 variants of the Ultraboost that I have purchased are beyond a pleasure to wear

Great Shoe you will need to make sure you have the appropriate Size and Width before finalizing your purchase I typically wear a size 13 but with this show I had to purchase a size 14 and 15 via Commerce to find the correct shoe size Size 15 is perfect but I was not expecting to go up two sizes to get the right size

These are the best shoes I have ever worn I am on my 4th pair right now and the quality just keeps getting better and better over the years It feels like you are walking on clouds

I am looking for 4 0 with new modern

These shoes are amazing The quality and comfort is impressive I had high standards for this shoe and it certainty surpassed my expectations

Lots of comfortable padding It does not get less comfy Have had a pair for a year and just got a second pair Great Overall shoe

The shoe is very confortable The materials are high quality and the color is bright

I have been wearing my Ultra Boosts casually for about a month when the foam started splitting and tearing away from the upper Very disappointing for such an expensive shoe

This is by far and away the most comfortable pair of Adidas I have ever had

Also these look much better then the 3 0 Loving that 1 0 pattern material again

I was a little skeptical at first like I always am when a new UB comes out The 4 0 does not disappoint First off the fit reminds me more of a 1 0 2 0 The primeknit is a little more stiff then the 3 0 Which I really like The tounge has a little more padding then past models as well And my fav part is the stitching which kinda reminds of of the 1 0

Heel cup on both shoes are a bit loose Have to lace them super tight to get me heel to stay put Not worth the high cost

If you are debating to buy these shoes do it already

they are perfect and comfortable They forced me to go for run in the morning I am happy with them

Have had a pair for a year and still in great condition

Ultraboost continues to be the best shoe out there right now Great look amazing comfort

Fits Great Looks Great I Recommend This Shoe For Everyone

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned I consider myself a huge sneaker head and on pretty much every shoe this is by for the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned

They are super comfortable and just the right size

This is my first pair of adidas this caught my eye on the looks

The comfort is the best The texture it self is a very good one

Fresh kicks the freshest of kicks that I have rocked in my days Love them

They are comfortable Feels like walking on nothing They look nice

The shoe is just incredibly comfortable but also has the support for running May be the best athletic show I have ever had

Very comfortable would recommend for running and style

The boost is really responsive compared to other made by Adidas with the Ultraboost

The shoes are super comfortable but the color was not what it looked like in the picture Grey trace pink

Light and comfortable Want to wear only as casual shoes instead of running in them that is how good they feel

Bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it Her foot is a little wide but it fitted her perfectly

I love the utility black ultra boost shoes They are super comfortable very light nice quality material Great for walking or being out on your feet all day I love this color Black with a dark grey looks very nice Would recommend thid shoe to anyone looking for real comfortable shoes

Walking on clouds all day this is my 4th pair and I will continue to buy them as long as they make them

I want every color Especially the all white I can wear these shoes with any situation and are beyond comfortable

I liked it cause it was mad comfortable Amazing bruh

comfortable great looking easy to clean water proof but with a couple of runs it already feels degraded

Yes I love the shoe and definitely worth the money

Very comfortable Like the color and fit They are awesome

Comfortable and lightweight for everyday use based on specific needs from work outdoors and hiking

Most comfortable running shoe I have owned Bought 4 other pairs

The shoes are so comfy fit like a glove and look So clean

Super comfortable but they run small maybe 1 2 a size bigger would be good

Adidas has really stepped up their game The ultraboosts are amazingly comfortable look great and well made Between these and the Tubular Shadows that I purchased I have not been happier with casual shoes in quite some time Highly recommended

Personally I did not think it would look on me because it kinda looked a bit manlier in the pictures But when I got them the burgundy color looked quite feminine as well These are also one of my most comfiest shoes I own next to the yeezys and nmds Great purchase recommend 100

Purchased these for my son and he is very happy with them

I loved them so much I bought a second pair when my first pair started showing wear Now 2 years 1300 miles on 2 pairs of shoes I am happy with that So far 830 miles this year alone Running 25 miles a week About to buy my 3rd pair as I start training for a marathon

They fit like a glove very comfortable shoes i will definitely recomended

Best shoe I have ever bought Most comfortable shoe out there Not much of a high performance runner but if you need it to be than it can get the job done

I have bad feet from playing sports all my life I have had many a foot operation because of it I have spend money at the doctors office on there corrective shoes They never helped But once I got these shoes my feet feel amazing I can play all my old sports workout all day and my feet never hurt I have 4 pars then I bought 2 pars for my parents and 2 for my daughter Tell whoever is making these thank you so much and Adidas rules

These kicks are fire Best shoe ever in comfort and fit Love the different color ways

First purchase ever and I have not regretted it at all Seriously worth every penny Look even better in person

it is the best looking and best feeling shoe on the market

Boost technology continues to be the best support for your feet

I dislike this product because getting a pair with black soles is next to impossible

I was excited to get these but they are not as comfortable as everyone says as they are very narrow They should maybe running shoes for actual men with man size feet I digress bottom line is I returned them and if you have wide feet look elsewhere

I recently bought a pair of UltraBOOST and I can not get over how comfortable they are The Primeknit is so breathable and stretchy and comfortable but the most important of all the boost midsole the boost is incredibly responsive Much more responsive then that of the NMD And every time you take a single step you feel the energy being absorbed and returned its an amazing feeling I could walk all day in these shoes These do run narrow so people with wide feet if you are a size 10 than go up half a size or true to size because these run true to size if you have a narrow foot you should probably go for your same size These are amazing I highly recommend you buy these

Looks great fits great very comfortable Perfect maroon color

The product was overpriced by a long shot Need some improvements in stability

Primeknit frayed kind of disappointed Needs durability

bought to run but not the best for running great for casual wear

been running in them for a couple weeks now with no issues and its one of the most comfortable running shoes I ever wore

Only thing I do not like about the shoe is the thin black rubber sole it is not quite durable enough and will not last as long as I would Like it too If they fix that I will buy another pair for sure The nit design does have some limitations in terms of foot securment in the shoe but plus side of it is it is very free feeling like I am just wearing a sock rather than a shoe Otherwise probably the most comfortable running shoe ever

Look I have read tons of reviews and heard a lot of GREAT reviews for these shoes so I decided to purchase them for work My feet kill me each day and I needed comfort After ordering these and trying them out for a week there was not really much relief at all Maybe it is the fact that I work on cement floors all day and at this point I do not think any shoe will help me Unless there is any suggestions for me If you are not working on cement floors all day test these out They are comfortable but not in the work field

Right sizing and color is just like the picture These shoes are the most comfortable thing I own I bought these specific ones for my boyfriends upcoming birthday and he has going to love adding these to his boost collection

It was a great choice in shoe and is very stylish and comfy

When I got the ultra boost it was so comfy and not narrow Get it right away I thought they would be sold out but they were not Trust me they look way better in person

I love the design But it felt like the shoe was going to fall off because the heels are not secure enough in the backend of the shoe even though the shoe felt very tight on my feet Wish I could try a size bigger Wonder if adidas would help

It is a great looking and very comfortable Thanks adidas

Think they run a tad big due to the flexible material

Very comfortable shoe It is worth the price It gets scratched easily though

I was lucky enough to get my ultra boosts in the size and color I wanted and was very pleased with them until the actual boost mid sole detached from the prime knit upper and also caused a crack split vertically in the boost Another somewhat minor problem is the fraying that occurs arond the toe area but this can be dealt with using a fabric shaver Overall I really liked the shoe but I was displeased with the incident regarding the separation of sole and upper

I like this shoes very much is too good and Comfortable

They are flex and go with anything the beat shoe but I ordered them too small so

This shoe is tremendous The design is awesome and the comfort is unparalleled They look great and would definitely recommend them to anyone

Amazing shoe super comfy when am out and about Very stylish with regular wear and great for running

Yeah this product is awesome I recommend them especially if your foot is narrow This shoe is slightly narrow on my feet personally but the primeknit is stretchy witch evens it out Overall the product is great and I recommend it

These are the only sneakers that are extremely tight in the ankle area i would like a refund

These shoes fell apart after less than a month and a half of wearing them Terrible quality for the price The sol of the shoe began to completely separate from the top Would not recommend for the price as they will only fall apart shortly after purchase

Let me start by saying I have not owned a pair of Adidas shoes since high school With that said these shoes are amazing I have own quite a few of other brands but the comfort in these have left me not wearing any other shoes The type of comfort is not comparable to any of them I would put it to feel like a high quality memory foam mattress They are built very well it seems like I watched a YouTube video where someone wore them a year and tentatively put 1000 miles on them they were the 1s though I wear them whenever I am off work since I have to wear boots at work If I was to guess I would say I have put easily 50 miles on them with no sign of wear on the tread They are getting dirty on the primeknit and the Boost material but only the primeknit because my wife and I have a 3 month old German Shepherd that love to step on them when we are outside The fit for me is perfect some might say they are snug but I like my shoes like that I ordered my normal size As they look right now I am willing to say they will last years for me I have no complaints about these shoes at all and I can not wait to see what newer versions will bring The only thing I wish they would do in the future is bring back the limited edition leather cage ones

Its a slick all day every day shoe every comfortable only down side about it the shoe is a snug fit so i would recomend going a half size up other then that you really get yourself a pair now

This colorway of the Ultraboost 3 0 is highly underrated They look great on foot I prefer them to a few of my limited edition colorways They are Ultraboost so the comfort is great need not be mentioned but I mentioned it anyway since they are that comfy you can not go wrong with ANY Ultraboost but this colorway is a sleeper Wake up cop folks

I have been a long time other brand shoe fan but I loved this shoe since the first time I tried them on Great fit feel comfort and style but once I bought them I realized that the outsole provided little if any traction in the gym or any smooth surface It almost seems like the outsole has been worn down for a long time even though they are brand new I still love them just wish the continental outsole was better

I had NMDbefore and they were great but after I bought these ultraboosts I have only been wearing them because they are the most comfortable shoes ever

If you do not own ultra boost you are doing yourself a disservice They are objectively the most comfortable shoe ever made

Its just a comfortable and great shoe I love the color

These shoes are beyond comfortable They did feel a little bit tight when i got them but within the first couple days they stretched to fit my feet perfectly I highly reccommend these shoes to anyone The price is a bit much but in todays world you get what you pay for And these are worth every penny

This is a very comfortable shoe The comfort is amazing

GET IT IF YOU CAN

best qualiti chip very fast deliveri aaaaaaa good good

it is better looking than pictures show and more comfortable than it looks like to be

I like the shoe cause it is fashionable and comfortable

This shoe is amazing for doing anything for ex and al going to school or going for a run

This shoe is amazing it has a perfect build it is light weight for if you want to excersise in them or if you wear them for design then there also very stylish

Are there any differences between mens and womens ultra boosts beside sizing Ive read some people say that womens are more narrow and snug fitting than mens is that correct

The cushion inside the shoes and on the heel is perfect

Great shoe have like 10 pairs of boost and they never disappoint Training for my second marathon wearing them and would not wear anything else

Fits true to size Bought my wife a pair and she loves them too Love Ultraboost shoes

Shoes are amazingly comfortable Probably one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes that I have ever owned

I love how comfortable the shoe is but after about 3 months of wear they have already ripped and the sides are falling apart

I love the product because best for long periods and running I think it is the best product in the shop

litter than my mom amazing its just way toooooo expensive

I am a huge fan of the Ultra Boost I have a white one already and wanted a new color so I went for the blue one When I received it I was sorely disappointed There was still evidence of glue where it was put together and the blue was not blue whatsoever It was more of a teal or bluish green Immediately returned it back to them do not recommend anyone buys anything blue from Adidasyou will probably get anything but blue

I love the style of the shoe and the various colors

I have had lower spine issues for years and avoided a lot of shoes that have extra support because they just look horrible Adidas has found the perfect balance of comfort and style I have bought 5 pairs of ultra boost caged and uncaged in the past 3 months Looking forward to more colorways being released

Colorway is awesome and the sneaker is extremely comfortable Love these shoes

This product is really comfortable and looks fantastic but was a little pricey For me it is perfect because I keep my sneakers well cleaned and in good condition so for me it was a good investment All I would say is it is a little expensive but that is the price of a quality comfort sneaker

The ultraBOOST is Adidas best shoe The cushioning is off the charts and they look great The price is completely worth it I am on my 4th pair and will not go back to any other shoe

Very comfortable but the white gets done try very quickly They need to come with a shirt care guide

Purchased it as a gift for my bro in law and my wife They love it Bought true to size and it fits perfect for both Very comfortable stylish and functional

The shoe is very comfortable and easy to wear for long periods Good for running and outdoor wear Amazing quality long lasting Very clean and nice looking shoes Personally favorite shoes on the market

These are my 10th or 11th pair of Boosts but might be the best ones yet I love the improvements made on the 3 0 Sooooo doooooooope

This is the absolute best running shoe I have ever had it is so comfortable to wear I highly recommend this shoe I did not think a running shoe could feel this good

The aglet fell off on the first day and I was very disappointed

One of the best shoes I ever bought great design and top quality of the shoes

Best shoes ever Would highly recommend to anyone

As described very comfortable Lightest shoe I have ever worn that does not sacrifice support

This shoe is amazing all my life I have had problems with my feet I could never find a sneaker that did not leave my feet aching halfway through the day until I got my first pair of ultraboosts These are the only sneaker I know I can wear for days on end that feel like I am walking barefoot 10 stars

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I will order a 2nd pair for sure

I have ten pairs of ultra boost and one NMD and just ordered the new R2 primeknit that came out Saturday

Super dope and super comfortable I also heard that these have wool mixed in with the prime knit too is that true

Love the color do not see this color too often ultra boost is so comfortable

The ultraboost is a very comfortable shoe and a staple in my collection

Have a few ultra boost already and the new ones are just like the old ones

Very comfortable design is nice no complaints whatsoever

Very comfortable and look really good I recommend this shoe

They are really comfortable for running and walking They look amazing and they fit perfect for my feet Best purchase

The crafting of the Ultra Boost must be significantly harder than the crafting of other shoes because catching the comforts of clouds and the feeling of awesomeness akin to surfing behind a cruise ship on a lava field chased by flying llamas that spit acid can not be easy

Great fit and comfort Always look forward to see what is coming next

I just bought this shoes because they look great and Kanye West worn them 1 2 size up super comfortable shoe

Immediate comfort with style the wool provides extra warmth and a less loose fitting compared to the first 3 0 primeknit releases

The boost technology is unlike any other I highly recommend these to anybody looking for a comfortable pair of shoes This is my second pair with boost and I am just as in love with the first pair as I am with the second

Comfortable stylish goes with everything lasts a long time No reason not to buy

Get more color ways

Very comfortable All White will get dirty very easy if not extremely careful

Good yes much pleasure Looks and how it feels

The color does not match its description it look like purple rather then maroon

Shoes are awesome great fit very light love them

Very comfortable running shoe Will definitely be buying another pair

Awesome pair of shoes Great Comfort Quality and Colorway

I told myself this was the last ub let us see how long I believe that

My son loves them Price is a little high but happy with them

Basically what I just said I have not worn it outside yet so take my review with a grain of salt

Quality style and comfort all in one Shipping was fast and the color way is perfect for the fall

Most comfortable shoe out there would recommend to everyone

My son and I are into athletic shoes We buy and wear many many pairs I had noticed a few years ago that Adidias was beginning to clearly outpace Nike in sheer quality of workmanship materials and design This pair of Ultraboost are a prime example

Product is very stylish and comfortable Lots of color choices as well

You can not go wrong with a fresh pair of ultra boosts they are still the best shoe on the planet

I love these shoes there my favorite shoe just need more arc support

The deep burgundy pair was not really burgundy It was more of a purplish red Other than that you cannot go wrong with Ultra Boosts

The most comfortable running i ever owned I also bought the ultraboost laceless and uncaged they are amazing as well

Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and I have tried them all

Couple of weeks ago I was stuck on whether to get the triple white NMD R1 or the Triple White Ultraboost and I chose the ultraboost and my oh my these shoes literally feel like no other I went 1 2 size up from a 9 5 to a 10 to give my feet some space to move around and the way they feel on your feet works some wonders I would give this all 5 stars but the boost do come with a few scratches and the delivery method is SO SLOW Other than that i would recommend these to anyone and the price is well worth it

Great comfortable shoe The best made shoe on the market

Bruh What are you waiting forDo your feet a favor order these nowMaxComfoetability

the only imperfection is a little bit of glue smudge on the heel cup

i like this product because it is stylish and really comfortable

I love this shoe so much it is my 7th pair of ultra boost

Stylish and comfortable Goes with any situation price is good and worth getting

Great shoe and super comfy The color is perfect

A1 comfort all day shoes best purchase true to size

it is confortable and a beautiful shoe in my opinion

This was my third pair of UltraBoost and I have already bought a fourth They are just so comfortable and I love all of the different colorways I feel like I need to collect them ALL Keep them coming Adidas I can not wait to check out the 4 0 

Long lasting quality casual and very comfortable

I like the fit color with and height Color good soft fit nice pack on my foot leg and sox

These were a birthday gift for my son He says they are the most comfortable sneakers he has ever worn and he is an athlete I hope they last as I think they are expensive

I like the Primeknit upper mainly because of its softness and flexibility However I think that because of the knit material it gets pretty warm on my feet when walking around I really like the design of the shoe and the comfort of the boost but I am somewhat disappointed in how my feet move completely off of the shoe when making any type of lateral movements Overall I still think this is a really stylish and pretty nice shoe

I love the product BUT I think we are all ready for 4 0 YOU guys have 154 color ways of 3 0 But overall it is the best shoe Boost I ever put on my foot i own 9 pairs in the last year

I did not buy these shoes for running so I can not speak on that issue but for wearing around they are incredibly comfortable I also love the way they look I have a wide foot and there is no problem with fit

Cool and comfortable design MOSTLY RECOMMENDED FOR Athletes

From someone who has Achilles tendinitis this has been a savior and I no longer have daily soreness I wear them all the time and hopeful I can start running again soon

I love these shoes they are super comfarble my number one shoe to go to

Best shoe out there but always has glue everywhere Every pair that i order always has manufacturer defects Adidas you guys need to step up your game

Good quality get what you paid for I am on my feet all day and my feet do not hurt

I absolutely loved my new Adidas UltraBoost The style is perfect for me and they are very comfortable I did get a size up because when I work out my feet can swell I like the color a lot the look very clean I am very happy with my purchase

The style is great looking and sooooo comfortable

Great fitting shoe and very comfortable when walking around or running

So I can not say that I have tried every shoe in the world but even if I had it would be hard to imagine a more comfortable shoe ever made it is like wearing my favorite most supportive pair of socks but with a supportive cloud attached to the sole I was not a huge fan of the look at first you know the whole styrofoam packing shell thing as the sole but once I wore them for a day I just do not even care anymore Now I finally get why my dad always wore such ugly shoes I am used to suffering for fashion but with all of this great new Adidas tech I no longer have to Comfy is the new cool for this young dad

These are one of the few shoes I can run in comfortably for 12 miles day I would say they are a little bulky heavy but the support I get from the soles make up for it Recommend them for anyone looking for a long distance running shoe

Adidas Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The colors and styles of the Ultra Boost are amazing

I have been waiting to buy a pair of black Ultra Boost I did not like the core black with the translucent cage so I am glad they dropped these I bought a pair for me and then loved them so much had to buy my husband a pair too I know sizing is weird for Adidas but these are def true to size

Just everything about it is amazing it is like wearing just socks

Comfortableand fashionable Very light and flexible love it

Arch support weak Thought they would feel like my boost 360 golf shoes

Almost perfect when I am wearing them it is like walking on clouds Best sneakers I have ever worn

The Ultraboost should be in every sneaker lovers collection It looks and feels excellent like walking on clouds Although I have had them only for a short time I can easily say they are the best shoe I have ever worn Looking for the downsides I have found very little The sole is flexible the fabric stretches and is breathable

Very comfortable and well made Great for casual wear and running

This is a really comfortable shoe and it so far has had good duribility but the price was a little much It is the most comfortable shoe that I have had to date and I really enjoy wearing them Would be a 5 star product if the price was a little less never less the shoes are great

These bad boys are perfect Go true to size if you decide to purchase

Its just such a great shoe Nothing is as comfortable as this shoe and is equal in looks I will definitely buy another pair

I love these shoes They are easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever had They accommodate my wide feet just like all other Adidas shoes usually do so you have wide feet and are used to wearing a certain Adidas size I would just go with that size All this being said I would like to say that the sole of the shoes scares me it seems like it will degrade very quickly because there is little to it They are made well there is just little surface area compared to other running or lifestyle shoes All this being said nothing would deter me from buy them again

Love the ultraboost it is so comfortable The side cages kind of dig into my foot sometimes but I am hoping that will change as I break them in some more

This has to be the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I came from wearing roshes but they were incredibly uncomfortable when wearing for long periods of time especially when running even a mile I went for a run immediately after my ultraboosts came in the mail and it made running feel effortless If you do have a pair of roshes and they fit snug you should order a half size up in this shoe You will have a little toe room but I had to compensate for the width of my foot Other than that amazing shoe and 10 10 would buy again

Very comfortable would recommend to everyone

Best shoes ever super comfortable and has boost Best Buy

I think these shoes feel comfortable because they grip my feet so tightly that I have no blood circulation to actually feel my feet Otherwise they are nice and I would consider ordering a half size up

On the best shoes I have ever bought comfort is out of this world The shoe fits great and looks even better 10 10 would recommend to anyone looking for a pair

Comfortable for everyday wear and looks good breathable material so my feet do not sweat

Ultra Boost are the comfiest shoes on the planet If only they were a bit less expensive i would buy multiple pairs FORSURE

great shoes originals comfortable and wonderful

Incredibly comfortable stylish and lightweight Will purchase again

Shoes have done a lot to alleviate my foot pain I have had multiple surgeries on my righ foot and I am a diabetic

The ultra boost is so cushionedI love it It feels like you are walking on a cloud

so comfortable and elegant you can wear it for the whole day without compaining

Bought my first pair last year and it is the only athletic shoe I have bought since I have gotten friends and family into buy these as well After trying them on it is like waking on clouds 

Goes great with jeans

Amazing feeling for the first time putting them on had LOTSSSS of turning heads when had them asking what shoes were they Very comfortable and also very stylish

I love the fit comfort and style The simple design customizable options and sound materials justify my decision to stick with Adidas for footwear

Very very comfy and stylish shoe Adidas did well

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The Utility Black color way looks even better in person

Got nothing to say because I am over the moon now

Had to treat myself to the best running I have worn so far

very comfortable and have great fit for my feet and love the color

Super Good for when I go to work as well as just for causal walking around

Its the best brand so comfortable and I recommend it for others as well

I have waited this ATR for ages and finally they are released The color is awesome and it is super comfortable Must buy

Overall the foam is comfortable for everyday walking and use Sneaker is stylish but they literally have NO arch support

Why do you need more infoI said I liked them This review text is too short apparently

Good shoe and will last

I like how comfortable the shoes is and love the color

Love them own multiple pairs will continue to wear boost

Best runing shoe on the marked i will cop more for sure

It is a great product extremely comfortable but it is a little expensive

Amazingly comfortable and attractive feels like you are walking on air but they could be made for people with a wider foot

I found these shoes to be amazing They are very comfortable have a great fit and look good with almost anything Definitely a great purchase

Super comfortable shoes as well as looking good with an outfit This shoe was everything I was looking for can not wait to see what other designs come out in the future Definitely recommend to a friend

Because the are my slyle and every one has them Tanner

cant really tell if it is wool or not but dope shoe no matter what

It is perfect and cheap It can be use for running or go to party And it is color also appreciated

Absolutely love the shoes Extremely comfortable Lightweight Good looking just a fantastic shoe

Very comfortable good toe space no blisters and feels very bouncy on my long runs

Its very comfortable and well made good quality

it is very comfortable and nice quality They are very dutiable and I plan on getting more

This shoe change the whole game This is when everybody turns around to look It is just perfect

Shoe is good looking and comfortable wool material is just amazing only issue I had was that there was a slight defect on a heel cage the plastic was somehow bended

Purchased for my son and he loves them He previously purchased the ultra boost last year and wanted this shoe again Very happy with these shoes

I like this product because it is comfortable while looking sleek

Litteraly the best purchase I have ever made Favorite shoe so comfy If you do not already have this shoe get it makes you experience perfect comfort and performance

I bought an all white size 10 and they were really long so I got these and went size 9 Both are really comfy but now with the right size it is perfect Converted 3 stripe member now

I like the product a lot This is the second pair I have gotten however I would have liked to have known that the insole was slightly changed because I think it raises my foot slightly

Great shoe Comfy as can be Just writing because i keep getting review too short message

These are definitely the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my entire life

Recommend to athletes and for casual wear The quality of this shoe is unmatched in the market today

Bought the ultraboost after a few friends recommended it to me The ultraboost are one of the best purchases I made Shoes are so comfy for everday use at university and stylish enough for a night out

When I got the shoe I realized it was defective with a bump on the prime knit of my left shoe It causes irritation when I run for longer distances It was also glued badly causing different toe space for each shoe The feeling that my left feet feels different from my right is very annoying I have already returned the shoe and I hope the next pair I get has better quality

Unbelievable comfort with quality you can feel it is a simple product that runs out of stock too fast Just to credit it is quality

They were delivered 36 hrs after I ordered them They were packaged perfectly Quality made They look and feel great according to my teenage son

These are the perfect pair of shoes They are great for running and for everyday wear I read they were 1 2 size big so I got a 9 instead of 9 5 and they fit perfect Glad I did otherwise it would have been to big I use them for walking and they are my daily go to shoes for whatever I wear The black color scheme goes with anything I run btw 60 80 miles a month and these are the most cushioned and comfy shoes I have ran in I definitely recommend buying these shoes

Most cozy shoe I own Hard to pick other options in my arsenal over them now

I really like the design of the UltraBOOST but I think you should start selling a new type of color for these shoes Camoflage I think that the camouflage would look absolutely fantastic on these shoes I also think that this would boost your selling rate of these shoes because people have to go to other websites or people to get these custom made shoes and your losing some business by not having this color I do hope to see this in the future

Very comfortable Wish They were available in half sizes in the larger sizes

I think the color and design are very sharp and creative Very comfortable also

excellent cushion and support can wear with anything definitely will recommend

Adidas really just did it did not they i can barely wear another shoe these made all my other shoes feel like bricks Adidas this is an flawless sneaker as for the price all i have to say is if you are trying to decide on buying just do it you wont regret it

The quality is great and the comfort is amazing The colors are nice and they look good on the foot

Comfort is great on these Worth the money great purchase

It is very easy and comfortable to wear It does not cause pains to your feet therefore it makes walking very easy and comfortable

it is very comfortable One of my favorite running shoes ever

I really like the shoes except for one thing The soles get dirty on the side and they do not come clean at the seams There is no way to avoid this so you end up with shoes that look dirty right away no matter how careful you are Otherwise great shoes for lounging or walking Not for sports but that is ok For me if the shoes are stylish and for walking and also expensive I do not want them looking dirty So unfortunately I can not recommend them

Worth every penny Took a few days to get used to how much more comfortable they were than anything else I have ever had

Well made so comfortable The way it made it shows that the sneaker is so comfortable you can also take a long walk

Excellent shoe very comfortable Slightly narrow though

I was blown away by how good they felt on my feet

I am going to give an in depth review I got the shoes they arrived in good condition Let me say these are the MOST comfortable shoes I have ever worn I have nmds and these fit very different I am an 11 in nmds but in these I need a 12 5 I am going to refund them and are order a 12 5 as these are the most fantastic shoes I have every purchased Definately recommend as the core black looks great Good luck enjoy

I love the product because it is the most comfortable shoes I have ever had

Overall quality and feel is great I love the way they look and would recommend them to anyone

This shoe is very comfortable for all occasions These shoes have been so nice I have bought multiple pairs Well worth the price

Perfect fit amazing comfort Will definitely buy more of these in the coming future

The shoes are very comfortable and high quality Highly recommend

Really comfortable flexible and supports Hard to find in stores though

I like how comfortable they are Plus they match everything but jeans

The pair I received seems to be defective The bottom is not glued correctly and they came with a tare in the fabric in the front

The insole was dirty out of the box good shoe imo

I love my ultra boost I was a bit skeptical but I can truly say ultra boost is the most comfortable shoe I ever owned True to size and very stylish do not think I can buy anything else

Expensive for shoes but you get what you pay for Definitely worth it

I think it is very comfortable but it scratches way to easily I do not even know how it could have got scratched on the cage and other parts I have only had them for a week and a half Other than that they fit fine

The best feeling shoe I have worn in a while Hands down

Great shoe feels like a runner but in vogue A little expensive but feels like a quality product that will last Anyways if they ever go out of style or get too gross to wear out you can always use them as solid running shoes

The running shoes are light comfortable and durable I would recommend them to anyone

Love it Fits perfectly I would like to buy a second pair

9 9 10 toe caps arent always perfect on ultra boost

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet

The material feels nice Sole is nice and cushiony Shoe is very fashion forward as well

i like it because it feel like you are walking on clouds

Great shoe very comfortable Have fractured back shoe makes life a little easier

Love it due to the comfort level and style Fits true to size and can be worn with any style pants

Comfortable shoes You can wear it anywhere my friends like them

These tennis shoes are so light weight and very comfortable The size and width was perfect and I am very satisfied

Great shoe and very comfortable but one gripe The adidas stripes and heel cup thing scratch really easily One day in I had a big scuff looking scratch on it Did not make me happy Still though super comfortable and worth the money

Really comfortable Shipped fast with no problems at all

I bought this shoe from an Adidas retailer It was very comfortable and stylish

I have less pain from support of material of the sneaker and sole

Adidas has the best shoes on the market hands down

Had high hopes for the ultra boost but had to return them because size 13 does not fit correctly too small

This product is definitely worth its price Very comfortable

Product was pretty good but I always had trouble with ultra boost they do not last long and are not that durable I will not recommend as a performance sneaker due to it is low durability but as a every day kick it will do that job very well these sneakers are the most comfortable sneaker adidas brand can offer in my opinion and very stylish sneaker I will give it a strong 5 5

Only thing to think about when buying these shoes is they are very easily dirty

Love these sneakers Definitely recommend these sneakers

Okay this a great shoe Normally I have to wear inserts into any shoe I wear This shoe cradles my foot like a glove and provides support so I can walk without foot pain This really is a great shoe I now own two pairs of these shoes

I had to be on my feet for over 15 hours straight For the first time ever my feet were not even sore

Fits well Good grip Being a size 12 5 this actually had good fitting

These shoes have to be one of the most comfortable shoes ever The primaknit feels soft and cushion and much nicer than the mesh on the NMDs The Boost material is great for walking around and provide a comfortable walk Not sure how these would hold up for running since I prefer the sides to be more rigid for that

super comfortable I will buy again please do not make me type so much

I really love the shoe it is like a sock to me but walking on clouds But the one thing I do not like is the ventilation in the shoe

do not let the pictures fool you I got the Tech Gray they are not gray They are basically brown purple

so i like that utraboost because this look so cool

Simple but perfect Like one walking on clouds 5start rating

Most comfortable shoe I have ever purchased great look to it too Great comfort without having to sacrifice the look of the shoe it is awesome

Look great but too narrow if you have a wide foot

Great support and feels like I am walking on air These shoes are pricy and I do wish they were less expensive However if you have some spare change for these shoes you will like them if you know you will make good use of them

I love adidas I love the boost outsole Love the design of the shoe

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Wear them all day I am a server and my feet never hurt after non stop moving and standing for 12 hours

Initially I was worried about the high price but after using them for a couple weeks now they were worth every penny and more In fact next time I get paid I am considering buying another pair Not only are they the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned but they are also very stylish gotten many compliments on them I would highly recommend These shoes to anyone

Quality fast shipping 100 authentic comfortable basically perfect

I bought a size 9 which is what I wear all the time This particular shoe ran 1 2 a size larger Sold my size 9 to my brother and bought a 8 1 2 Best pair of running shoes I have had

My son wanted these sneakers for back to school senior year We received them pretty quickly after placing the order He tried them on and said they are very comfortable They look great and will go with everything he wears I would recommend these sneaker to anyone looking for comfortMy sons words

So comfortable shoes It feels you have nothing in your feet but comfort Give it a try

You can not top boost and they look great Amazing tech

Booooooooooooooooost Best shoe on the market Fast delivery

Yeah I like ultraboot energy and ultraboot uncaged

Pretty satisfied with them They were a little big for the size but overall really like them

I highly recommend this sneaker

Great shoe fits true to size I skeptical about ordering true size when I seem to wear different sizes in adidas shoes But it worked out great

Super comfortable great everyday shoe I can not run in it as it is not stable enough for me Must be a perfectly neutral runner

Like no shoe I have put on in a good way

I have been a Adidas customer for most of my life and typically go for the higher end of the line as I work out and run quite a bit I recently purchased lease than 1 month the Ultraboost running shoes 4 weeks later the top laceholerbroke on the left shoe and is almost broken on the right The system is exactly the same as my previous Ultraboost runners but what happened to the quality

Shoes look great and are comfortable the only thing is the tip of the outsold looks like it is starting to wear down and I have only had it for 2 weeks also it is a little tight around the adidas cage

Comfortable and has a great look that goes with almost everything Great everyday shoes

Best combination of style and comfort Most balanced shoe I have ever owed

comfort and cushion first pair I purchased 4 months ago fit perfectly this newer version was a full size too small Wear a 11 almost all the time but had to upsize to a 12 The 12 fit perfect so beware if ordering online

If you are a sneakerhead and Ultra Boost lover You must add this shoe to your collection The colorway is great for the fall season Quality primeknit with hits of grey and burgundy dynamic boost and neutral cool smoke grey cage set this shoe apart from previous colorways

Also not psyched about the current color selection which seems to cater to casual wearers and not runners May need to go in a different direction unless new colors come out soon I have neon green and generally prefer brighter colors and combinations

These are the most comfortable shoes I saw them at first and did not buy a pair then one was gifted to me Pretty sure I will exclusively buy Ultraboosts from now on Adidas keep this in stock Also more colors please

It mad good and a mad good purchase and lit it bonya

These trainers are just right and easy on my feet after a long day on my feet they do not hurt no were near as much as my other trainers did And my bunoiness do not not hurt no were near as much with these new trainers thank you

The white version looks very nice They are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned It honestly feels like I am wearing another pair of socks which is a good thing I would definitely recommend them and it is worth every dollar

its comfy and adidas is the way to go comfy and is the best

I will be buying only ultra boost running shoes from now on These shoes feel amazing

Very comfortable shoe with perfect sizing and flexibility 10 10 would recommend

The most stylish and most comfortable sneaker ever worn

Most comfortable shoe I have worn I should not have to write a long review

My son says his menultra boosts are the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn

The product is amazing and exceptional quality I absolutely love these shoes

Adidas ultra boost its the best shoe overall comfortable and quality wise you can not imagine until you wear it So what are you waiting for

The level of comfort is outstanding and it elevates any outfit you have got on assuming you are using this for casual wear and not fitness

The UltraBoost are great Top comfort feel and fit Very light and have a great bounce back Will buy more

Adidas took over the game with this shoe Best shoe ever most comfortable thing I have ever worn

this product is simply the best because it is very comfortable and beautiful

Amazing every day shoes The color really stands out against other ultra boosts

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The triple whites are so fresh and my favorite out of the three pairs I own If you are debating between a few color combinations go with the triple white People keep saying they get dirty easily but there are plenty of sneaker cleaning products on the market that eliminate this problem in a matter of minutes Great shoe

This product is comfortable and Easy to wear for men and women

The whole shoe is perfect can not wait to get another pair

One of the most popular shoes for a reason they look great and they are crazy comfortable 10 10

Super comfortable like running on pillows Well made yet light

Looks great when running or go out somewhere Soft on the bottom when walking or running

The shoes are stylish and very comfortable best shoe

I like the ultra boosts because they are very comfortable and they look cool I feel good when I run in them because they are the best running shoes I have had

The upper material began to rip after just one week of normal wear

This shoe is absolutely amazing in every aspect comfort style and the price I am always convincing my friends to cop these

Once you try them on it is love and take it from me I hate adidas with a passion when I was a kid I had a pair fall apart on me told my self never again this is my first pair of adidas cense the year 2000

I like this product because it is everything adidas promised and some

The second you put your feet in these shoes you will not want to go back to any other type They are EXTREMELY comfortablehave incredible support especially in the heel area and just look sexy to be quite honest Whether you are running or walking you can truly notice the shock absorbance of the shoe once your foot impacts the ground This is the first pair of Adidas shoes I have ever bought and I am sold for life if they keep producing shoes with this level of quality and comfort

Comfortable like walking on a cloud and stylish I would recommend this product

The shoes is in good quality Its design is great and the price is just enough

Very comfortable and I already fell in love with shoes

I recent bought my first pair of ultra boost about a month ago I could not be in love with these shoes more They are very stylish and look good with any outfit Also a great shoe to wear to the gym I purchased the triple whites and over time they got very dirty which happens with any pair of all white shoes Because of that and the fact that they are just a great shoe in any category I ordered the black ones and the shipping was very fast and I could not be happier with them I recommend these to everyone I know and once they try them on they are sold

Everything is good but my new shoe has scuffs like this I am sure that it is not my false and i have no idea how they are from I hope that I will have some explaination and advices about that

Amazing shoes I have like 10 pairs Purchased as a gift as well and they love them

Love the comfort feel good on my feet I like hiw light they are and the style hope to swe more of these brands

This is my first pair of ultraboost 3 0 and I have to say that adidas knocked it out of the park with these The color pops and the boost is great all around Plus they actually had my true size of 12 5 and I could not be happier Thank you

If you want a great looking style and running shoe you found it

I like most people was a little skeptical of how a shoe could be priced the way it is Sure it is an investment but from the moment I put them on they were the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Although these shoes are super comfortable I do believe after a long time standing in them they may start to lose their signature comfort a little too soft if that makes sense and also if you have them up tightly they may strain your foot This however should not scare you from buying the shoe the investment was very much worth it The style and supreme comfortability make this my go to shoe for years to come

Feel great look even better I love the positive impact collaboration with parley looking forward to seeing more

The comfort was great but as I wore the shoe the toe area started to care in so there would be massive bumps The bumps would press up into my left foot causing pain

the khaki color is amazing the comfort is amazing do your feet a favor buy some boost ASAP

Good product but ultra boost writing on the heel is already wearing off and I have not even worn the shoes yet And the online picture looks to have more black accents than the shoe actually has which I was disappointed by Overall very comfy and good looking shoe other than these minor flaws

I like the product cause they lit They fit lit They look lit They make me feel lit And all my friends and bruddas say they is lit Sooo wazzzaaaaa it is lit

I do not like and disappointed with the produce like give me a seconsd hand have the pink color on my the shose and the shoes is not look nice as the picture could i retune

I own many ultra boost from the 1 0 to current This colorway is smooth Fusion of comfort and style

Amazing Need a all brown with copper letters for work Brown ultraboost Brown Brown

Must cop for you collection Or even just because you like them

Only shoe I can wear during a 12 hour hospital shift

Awesome product everyone should have these they were comfortable at a great price everyone should get some because these are just plain perfect

The shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned You can tell the shoe is high quality and worth the price

You can not go wrong with a pair of Adidas Ultraboost This particular colorway is perfect as it allows you to wear both light and dark pants sweats etc and match perfectly Highly recommended

Overall amazing shoes I really do not have anything negative to say about them

it is a very nice shoe got no complaints but that I recommend taking out the insole

This shoe is just perfect the minute you put them on it will feel like walking on clouds it feels like putting on a sock Best purchase ever made

Best and most comfortable shoe I have ever worn highly recommend

I wanted black you did not have it so I settled for the black and blue You sent me some sort of turquoise color Thanks What a surprise Disgruntled was taken as a nickname

Ultraboosts are of course one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The 3 0 primeknit pattern is not my favorite at all but in this colorway it looks great to me it is the perfect blend of pink and gray this is better than or what the Reigning Ch and collaboration should have been I am ready to try the 4 0 let us get the triple black model right the first time around

Yes cause it is comfortable to wear and able to tun golf in

I love the shirt and it makes real sense i wish I can get it for free

Love this shoe I use it for lifestyle so i get 1 2 size bigger and there perfect The cargo trace on point CANT WAIT TO COP ANOTHER color wave

If you are looking for a new running shoe and or just a great shoe everyday wear This is by far the best shoe I have ever put on my feet

Great looking but should have sized up compared to 3 0 Boost Had to return

I love my new shoes they are very stylish I love the color too

Super good fit and the colorway is lit The boost was definitely worth the money

The shoes are very comfortable and look good on the feet my only problem with them is that they are a bit expensive

The shoes were really comfortable as expected but I felt the toe area was a little too stretchy which made kinda off unsupportive but the lockdown in the heel made up for it

Fits perfect and extremely comfortable Definitely will be getting more color ways

I found the sneaker I want to wear all day everyday These are by far the most comfortable shoes I own if you do not have a pair you are missing out

The most comfortable shoes on planet earth This shoe made me enjoy walking for hours at my work place

The color way is visually appealing the shoe fits well and it feels as if I am walking on a cloud compared to other tennis shoes I have worn

Would be the perfect shoe aside from the Continental sole that is almost worn through at the ball of my foot in less than a month They were not worn daily or used to run

IVE BEEN WANTING TO GET A PAIR OF THESE SHOES FOR A WHILE AND MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORNED TOLD ME THEY ARE THE BEST AND THEY ARE THE LOOK THE STYLE THE BUILD AND THE COMFORT HOWEVER IF THERES ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY NEGATIVELY ABOUT THEM IT WOULD BE THAT YOU CAN SEE GLUE ON THE SHOE FROM THE BUILD IN MULTIPLE PARTS AND IN OTHER SHOES IVE SEE I HAVE ALSO NOTICED IT

It is really a great shoe Comfortable perfect fit looks fantastic

I have owned and loved many Adidas shoes over the past 20 years But this new design has an allmesh front half with hard Adidas stripes on the sides Those stripes squeezed my foot Also the laces have been moved lower and so the fit by the ball of the foot no longer can be adjusted with lacing Comfy footbed however I have read the same complaints by others reviewing this shoe

Comfortable and stylish good color boost is the best

Nearly a week into owning these shoes and have put many miles very comfortable

great colorway but for me it runs half size small i compared to a 1 2 size smaller ultraboost multicolor and they are similar length your results may vary

I was sleeping on UB for a while but finally got a pair and they instantly broke my all time top 5

I am just sad I waited so long to buy a pair They are amazing

Initial impressions great shoe for casual and road running if you like the soft plush feel Soles are pretty soft so will see how long they will last for the next few months

I like the comfort of the shoe Plan on buying more ultra boost soon

Second pair and well worth it Love the color and can not beat boosts with comfort

Love the fit but the heels feels slim The pure boost feels perfect and I expected this to feel similar or better but was a little let down by the just ok feel

Will definitely continue to add UB to my growing collection

It is a great shoe very comfortable but a tad but expensive for their wear

Really worth it even if you do not run Most comfortable shoes ever

Nice very cushioned running shoe Some people might find it squishy but at 200 lbs I am glad to have the cushioning that these offer Planning on buying more pairs to have extras

These are the most comfortable and best looking shoes I have ever owned

They are good for running and really comfortable

Amazing shoe Definitely one of the most comfortable and stylish shoes ive ever worn I would say they are worth the price Big fan of adidas

Did not regret buying it at all Enjoy walking in it

Quite expensive but these days this what you pay for it otherwise excellent product

Incredibly comfortable and stylish You definitely get what you paid for with these shoes Everyday shoes or statement shoes you decide You can not go wrong with either

Great show Fits like every other ultra boost The trace pink is so much nicer in person Great shoe to talk around in at work and a real joy to run in

These are comfortable but not for serious running as they are not very supportive

The blue in the pic does not match the actual shoe very off and the size was off by 1 2

Obviously ultra Boost are extremely comfortable I am a huge fan of this colorway Trace Pink

Very unique and comfortable I like how the boost technology was created

 xc3 xbaper confortable shoes I like that is just one piece

This is honestly the best shoe I have ever had The Prime Knit is super comfortable and the boost gives me the spring and comfort I need Never leaving the boost line

I only run in these they are my favorite out of my 3 runner they feel amazing top to bottom prime knit upper feel great the cage really locks you in the Boost is spongy feels better the faster you run the only complaint is the soles have a lot of ware and I only got about 50 miles on them do not think they will make it to 150 for the price they should last 300 or 400 miles min

love the product but they need to make more colors and a little bit more Hip little nerdy but the most comfortable shoes i have bought Have bad feet and this shoe is GREAT on comfort

I like it it is really comfy I recommend this to anyone who can afford it

The ultra boost 3 0 is made of a stretchier knit material than the 2 0 I had to get used to it at first but after a couple of times wearing it I became accustomed to the feel If you are looking for a comfortable sneaker that looks good with jeans and shorts then the ultra boost if definitely the shoe for you

There are not many sneakers that come even close to the overall comfort and quality of Ultraboost Hands down my favorite sneaker

Great shoe comfy but a little pricey But like most things you pay for what you get

Very comfortable footwear quality is worth the money whether running or just simply to walk around this is the sneaker you want on your feet Adidas is ahead of the competition with these

most comfortable shoe I have ever worn llllllllllllll

The best comfortable shoes Adidas has come out with

Narrow for my wide foot but best shoe for a long walk for the bounce I get from each step

Fits your foot with almost sock like feel Unparalleled cushion in the heels great shoe Not to mention the styles

Great shoe and I love the cushioning They run a little small for me I have to wear one size up Hopefully one day we can get a lighter ultraboost as well

Great running shoes Super comfortable Cant wait to use for my first half marathon

These are just as comfortable as my last pair no big surprise there

I like these shoes because of the look and the meaning behind them We need to save our oceans and this is a step in the right direction I hope to see more from parley in the future

I own a pair of the NMD City Sock and it is a nice shoe and it wears fairly comfortably I was highly skeptical of the hype around the Ultraboost and boy was I wrong These are THE most comfortable pair of sneakers that I have owned I recently purchased a pair of Vapormaxand ended up returning them because of how uncomfortable they fit The Ultraboost beats it hands down

Sneaker is so comfy I recommend this sneaker for runners or for walking around all day Ex Theme parks

These shoes are so comfortable They feel like therapeutic pillows for your feet plus feel great on the ankles Very easy on the knees while being active You can wear them tied or casually untied and they still fit well The construction design improves with every model and the colorways are sweet

I love then and now I want to own all the different colours

Everyone knows the UB line is awesome No need to get into detail Great shoe super comfy and these khaki colorway is fire dawg

They are very comfortable and I like the color of them

My first ultra boost pair and will never bye any other shoe from now on The most comfortable show I have own

Looks great and it is very comfortable they mesh however is very delicate it could rip very easily

there is nothing not to like about UltraBoosts Comfort story and function all combine perfectly together

Very comfortable extremely clean show great sizing

They are like walking on clouds and sunshine Boost is the way to go

The ultra Boost is the ultimate running shoe I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone

Love how comfortable these shoes are and how stylish they can be as well

Incredibly comfortable and very appealing to the eye

Most comfortable shoe I own I own 6 pair of Ultra Boost and looking forward to more

The perfect mix of athletic and casual sneaker I would not wear any other shoe besides an Adidas Ultraboost

Subtle color way of an phenomenal running shoeminimalmovement

A very comfortable shoe light weight and can be worn all day

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and they look phenomenal I have wide feet so they are a little narrow but it does not affect the comfort of the shoe

Began to fray after 2 weeks with minimal use very disappointed with this

Love the shoe but I have the all white ultra boost 3 0 in the same size and this one runs smaller

I love these shoe3 pairs and I have never regretted putting them on in the morning If you was not the comfiest shoes in the game cop a pair of ultra boost

Really nice the primenit is soft and the boost is boosty

Love ultraboosts and anything boost for that matter

So bummed Got these right away before they sold out I have had many pairs of the ultra boosts before These were a 1 2 to a whole size bigger can not even exchange them cause they are sold out now

Adidas boost will always be the most comfortable

For those of you who do not own a pair of ultra boostsit feels like you are constantly walking on a marshmallow The shoe runs 1 2 a size small but if you take the in sole out it fits perfectly

These shoes are beautiful They look even nicer once they are on your feet Very comfortable and stylish

It is the most comfortable I have ever warn But I wish it was designed a little bit less bulky

Great shoe very comfortable and stylish I would definitely recommend these

Great concept for saving the oceans and same comfort

Had to take out insole but other than that perfect

The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The fit is perfect and the style fit with any outfit

The color is Fantastic and Extremely Comfortable

They are very comfortable and good quality shoes They also stay pretty clean for being white

Very happy with my purchase Took me long enough because they did not have my size

Great knit upper that provides breathable sock like fit plus boost mid sole providing marvelous cushion And they look great too

Absolutely love this colorway Other than the 93 17 eqt ultraboost still un rivaled in comfort My only issue is that sometimes the manufacturing of the shoe is poor When mine arrived they had glue on the stripes and part of the metallic on the word ultraboost on the heel cup was chipped or came off when you spend 190 for some sneakers you would expect them to be flawless And then the option of returning them does not make sense because you sell out in my size so all I can get is a refund rather than a new pair so I just end up keeping them even though they arrived partially flawed Still my favorite brand by miles though

As a man who cares about comfort and style these are a must have for anyone sneakerhead or not Boost makes walking a breeze and the primeknit is just icing on the cake

Amazing Hands down the most comfortable shoe I own I am a sneaker head so I had to see what the hype was about To my surprise these shoes live up to the hype I want more already I need more

Great looking comfortable shoes Great support and traction Very true to size so order your actual size

I already own a pair of Ultra Boostand this color way is a great addition

The comfort and the colorway easily makes for this to be a Classic

This was my first time buying a pair of ultraboost and I have to say they are my most comfortable shoe I highly recommend

Best running shoes period Light weight ideal for running

shoes fit perfectly and feel as if I am walking on clouds

Loved them except for they were half a size to small

it is tighter than other 3 0 but still comfortable

Great fit and comfort I would recommend this color way

Love ultraboost comfortable Goes with any outfit

My 1st pair of UltraBOOST sneakers and I LOVE them

Ultraboost never let you down Always improving the product

These shoes look way better in person If you like blue this color way is fantastic I would buy another pair if they become available again They are great shoes You have to buy them

I love these shoes The color is very vibrant and looks very high tech If you want to use this show for running it will never let you down

First of all the shoe looks amazing And it performs even better Also the fact that they used recycled plastic bottles left on the beaches is a huge plus for me I am really big on having a clean planet The only con I have with the shoe all be it it is a small one it is that it took me a couple of hours to break the shoe in

I really like the design of the shoes starting to wear this shoe makes me not wear other shoes

I absolutely love these shoes I wear them almost everyday They are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn The only issue I have is that the lace hole on the cage ripped Now they are unwearable I am very disappointed because I only wore them for a couple months and took fairly good care of them

Great looking shoes that are extremely comfortable

I am surprised with the comfort and cushioning it offers I ordered based on reviews and needless to say that I am pleased with my decision Initially I thought there is a problem as the lower sole extends a bit outsize the shoe but then all the other official pictures were the same

Very comfy and stylish does run a half size big

Amazing comfort

These shoes grab the attention of my friends everytime I wear them I originally bought them for running but have switched their usage to be casual Work has never been so comfortable

This is my first pair of Adidas Ultra boost I got the khaki they are awesome very comfortable at first I thought it was all hype it turns out to be these and got to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I definitely will be buying more thanks Adidas I am a new fan

Insanely comfortable Like walking on a cloud Absolutely love them

They fit half size small Slightly narrow wish they would have said that

I love those shoes Very light I have very wide foot but the material its soft and stretches

Best running shoe in the game Feels like I am running on clouds

Size runs 1 2 smaller than other boosts Shoe looks good but hard to decide if the shoes are comfortable if sizing is not consistent especially if you can only order one shoe at a time

The most comfortable Adidas shoes I have ever worn

Superior Cushioning These shoes are pretty much the most comfortable shoes I have ever run in

I love this shoe because it is leather caging and cmon adidas make them all leather a little scared paying this much for a shoe but if you find the leather ones be true to size and get them they are worth it

The materials are great and the shoe is very comfortable

I have NMDs as well The Ultraboost is more comfortable has more support and partnering with Parley was a huge deal for me

This shoe was too narrow for me and I have a medium width foot My foot spills over the side and my pinky toes feel pinched I tried going up half a size but it did not help The shoe looks great and I can tell it would be comfortable if they widened it some Hopefully new versions will be wider because I really wanted to wear this shoe

The fit was a bit more snug compared to my other UB 3 0s but it was not tight it was just right

Feels like walking on marshmallows or the moon even

Go 1 2 size UPPPPP The material on these are different and I think it makes it more narrow and tight around your feet

Any and all ultra boosts are great This one is just a bit smaller and tighter fitting than most so go up a half size at least Plus the loop on the front could have been a bit more subtle One of the best looking ultras by far though

I love the shoes and concept behind it but I do not see the 20 dollars increase in price Go half a size up mine was tts and was too small

Are one of the most comfortable shoes I have True to size for this boost felt a little snug but still feels nice

Very light and good prime knit always wanted 2 0 it is great shies

Was too small had to return it Go 5 up your regular size I think the recycled plastic gives it a tighter fit

Ultra boost is amazing Wish they had size 13 though Great shoe and meaning behind the shoe

Very comfy recommend to half size up on 2 0s though

Great shoes recycling plastic from the ocean an A

Great shoe FatherDay gift Dad really likes them

Ultra boost is life Great color way and great cause

Good very comfortable but the material is cheep and rips

Great pair of shoes that are one of the most comfortable sneakers around Only gripe I have is that the caged fit makes the width feel a bit narrow compared to other shoes If you have wider feet I would recommend sizing 5 up Otherwise great looking shoe

Very light weight comfortable and fit can not wait to actually run in them

These shoes are very comfortable However the material snags easily

I love the feel of this shoe So light and so comfortable

This is my first pair of ULTRABOOST shoes Came highly recommended from friends I am an avid runner and this shoe is definitely on par with other high quality running shoes They are a tight fit had to exchange for a half size larger Love the Parley design You would never guess that they are made from recycled materials Great shoe overall

One of the most comfortable shoes ever could wear these all day

comfort and style mixed perfectly into a great pair of sneakers

Nice color and Quality did not end up keeping however Slightly tight in the toe box would recommend a half size larger

Go up half a size and these are the best Ultra Boost 3 0s so far This is not a light statement so I would have to defend it I will start with fit A lot of people complain about the tight fit and so do I my true size fits too snug But going up half a size will result in not only a very comfy fit but a better one than regular UB 3 0s The regular Primeknit is just too stretchy that there is pretty much zero containment or support The Parley Primeknit on the other hand is a bit less stretchy still crazy comfy though and more supportive Let me put it this waythe up half a size Parley UB still fits more snug than true size UB in a good way I feel significantly more comfortable wearing these all day compared to my regular UB 3 0

Best I ever had and they said my review was to short so best I ever had

Ultraboost is super comfortable and you save the ocean

Most comfortable shoes ever Would recommend to all my friends

Good quality control awesome concept love the idea Adidas

This is my 3rd pair of boost sneakers They are rly decent for running

Had to ship it back Waste of time Way too small

I like this product because of the way the shoe hugs your feet And every time you walk it feels like your on a pillow

These shoes are thee most comfortable shoes that I have ever put on This shoe is in a class of its own But it better be because of the price I paid for them

Great Shoe Love the color way and matte coloring on heel cup The leather cage really makes the shoe Should be considered LTD given the quality One of my fav ultra boosts

nice summer shoe premium pk and boost sole is comfortable 3 0 runs a bit large would recommend going half a size down vs 1 0 and 2 0were pretty tts

I have 4 pairs of the previous Ultra Boostand the new design for the 3 0definitely feels like they have listened to feedback from the consumer and have improved the prime knit on these shoes After a while my toes would start to go numb in the 2 0and I have not had that issue with the 3 0there is flex where it is needed and support where it belongs Definitely a huge improvement

best shoe out in the market defiantly a must buy

The most comfortable shoe I have ever had The fit and cushion is truly amazing

I never write reviews for anything but these shoes warranted me to voice my opinion These shoes are miles ahead of every other shoe I have worn By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn in my life They grip every part of your foot nice and snugly while still maintaining breathablilty

Ultra boost always good always boost me up

Excellent sneaker boost alday comfort and style adidas killing it

Boi you better buy this shoe Is is so good an comfortable

The boost is very comfy and forms to your foot and reduces impact giving you more to run farther with less effort

Best shoe that I have ever purchased I only wear ultra boost running shoes If I could recommend anything it would be that Adidas make more ultra available Absolutely love the shoes

Comfortable and well made shoe I would recommend getting

These shoes are made of yarn and will make your feet sweat like nothing you have ever experienced in life Howeverthey are the most comfortable things you will EVER put on your feet hands down it is like a slice of heaven My hubby bought me some I bought more But they are made of yarn They smell terrible I mean they really stink Sweat in them one time Better yet two but they feel AMAZING

Comfortable shoe for not one good reason I thought the nmdwere comfortable but when you step in these it is something else Go true to size for the 3 0do not listen to anyone else saying otherwise

This shoe has excellent craftsmanship and great confort

Man these shoes are the best So dang comfortable I used to wear skate shoes and when i got into my 30s my feet just had enough I would always have achy feet and my buddy told me to give UltraBoosts a shot Within 3 months I have 5 different pairs Now I just need some UltraBoost dress shoes for fancy ocassions too

The PrimeKnit upper is unbelievably comfortable The Boost is extremely comfortable It is like i have socks on and walking on pillows all day long Love them

After hearing about the Ultra Boost buying a pair of NMD R1 and nMD R2 I finally decided to purchase my first pair The comfort level puts both of the NMDto shame Although the NMDdoes the same to most other shoes on the market The R2Primeknit is more flexible and breathable But everything else goes to the Ultra Boost Fit bounce and overall comfort I would DEFINITELY buy another pair

it is super comfy by far the best comfort shoe I have ever had

it is a perfect fit it is comfortable They look slick they light

I love these shoes because their comfortable and stylish at the same time

Super comfy and its the one shoe that doesnt make my feet hurt after walking around so much

The ultraboost is worth the price pint as it is one pof the most comfortable and durable shoes I have ever owned

The shoes are just amazing can walk all day and have no complaints

I like this product because of just how comfortable is it 100

Great shoe The design style and comfort make it 10 10

I love the ultra boosts are not no other shoes is compared to this NASA space shoes

For me personally I wish they were just a little wider Or came in a Wide I had to get them a hakf size bigger for the width to fit right which made them just a little too long but still comfortable

Literally has revolutionized the Shoe industry Ultraboost is the profound shoe of comfort for style or athletics

The shoe is already pulling apart in the seams look like poor quality and workmanship

The energy red I bought before were far better than the Navy Blue The knitted was way more comfortable and the shoe itself overall till someone stole it from infront if my house The Navy blue do not seem to have the same quality

Ultra Boosts are not only comfortable but stylish

Like walking on clouds Very stylish and functional

Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn I would recommend this to anyone

I absolutely love these shoes I was not a believer at first but after finally saving up and getting a pair it was one of the best shoe decisions of my life Before I had to use Superfeet Insoles so my feet did not hurt after standing all day but these shoes have made me feel great without having to get extra insoles Only thing I feel bad about is that I am neglecting my other shoes now

These are the best shoes out right now I do not know another comfortable shoe

Great multi purpose shoe that goes with any outfit

Most comfortable shoe that I have ever purchased in my life

These shoes are the best shoes I have ever worn was slightly upset with the price at first but after wearing them it was worth it

The shoe is very comfortable not so great with lateral movement

Boost is life Run a half size big Feel great on them feet 

This is probably the best shoe adidas has ever made

Comfortable fit but glue in toe created discoloration almost immediately It was quite a bummer on an all white shoe

Most comfortable shoe ever worn The first editions were the best in my opinion but the ultraboost and boost lines by adidas kill the game

Honestly the most comfortable kicks i have ever rocked

Great cushion and comfort all day long I bought them for comfort not a sneaker head

Beautiful design and very comfortable Will purchase other colour for my favourite collection

The ptimeknit falls apart too easily And seems like their is no support

I usually wear size 10 but I would go down to 9 5 for a perfect fit otherwise they are one of most comfortable shoes I own

Very comfy and stylish would recommend for anyone looking for a comfy shoe

5 stars hands down ultra boost is the best for comfort

Amazing ultra boost wish they made more colors at the same time

I love the product best purchase I ever made

The Adidas Ultra Boost is very comfortable it is a very stylish running shoe that is perfect for anyone

do not like the fit of the new UBWhy try to reinvent the wheel1st and 2nd gen fit so much better and looked so much better

I can not say I would go 5 size up but depending on the socks you wear you might find your toe rubbing against the toe of the shoe

Most comfortable shoe ever And the midsole was easy to blackout for the triple black look

Extremely comfortable shoes I walk a lot at work and most shoes would leave your feet tired but these shoes are super comfortable

most comfortable shoes i own Boost is like walking on clouds

As with all UBS super comfortable durable one of best color ways love these shoes for tts

Very stylish shoes that are extremely comfortable Require a lot of care to stay white and shiny however

Although price is high great comfort I wish I can afford all colors

Nice fabric and all great idea too But the way they altered the sizing was poor Definitely have to go up a half size or more I didnt even bother trying for those light blues over the size being off for the regular blue ones

I really like the comfort on these shoes I like how it fits to size and it does not squeeze my wide feet

By far the most comfortable shoes I have owned in my life time Best shoes in the world

Some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased and they are stylish enough to wear out and about

The best shoes I have purchased Beeeeeeeeeeeeest

Another great 3 0 Love the color and the leather cage Very comfortable shoes Shipping was quick I would recommend to anyone

Boost is always the way to go Never have I worn a more comfortable shoe

These shoes were for my grandson He loves them They are just perfet

Very comfortable The sides run a bit narrow so if you have wide feet go half a size up Light weight Good material good build I still thought it was a bit pricey for what it is but it is still great So far the shoes are still intact no tear or hole

The boost is super soft through out the shoe though I would say the eqt boost has more boost probably adidassecond most comfy shoe

Most comfortable shoe ever can not go wrong with these

These 3 0are super comfortable and the leather cage is an added bonus to the quality of this already great product

This colorway is great and even better on foot a must cop

Very comfy shoe These are a modern classic Very glad I purchased

These shoes are like walking on air Definitely recommend you buy them

They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Wish these were cheaper to buy because I would own multiple pairs

You cannot go wrong with an ultraboost purchase Simply the most comfortable shoe on the market and they have helped my back problems immensely

As others have stated these shoes are super comfy however they have pretty much no support Not that I bought them for their support but it literally feels like a sock on a bed of super soft foam which is great for just everyday stuff I also have a pair of Energy Boost and although not as comfortable they offer the support needed for cross training I wear the Ultra Boost when I go out and about and put on the Energy Boost when it is time to get down to business

That my favorite line of shoes and I will continue to buy them

Most comfortable shoe I ever wore Was a Jordan guy but not anymore BOOST all day

Very comfy shoe but when I went running in them they started developing a rip after the first jogging session Quality is very bad in my case

This shoe is beyond comfortable The boost technology really is supportive and responsive it is a great running and lifestyle shoe

It feels as if i am Walking on clouds Maximum comfort

The most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever owned

Comfy and they look awesome Would recommend this to anyone who wants comfortable shoes that could be worn casually at the same time

Very comfortable and light Best sneakers I ever had Wish there are more colors Highly recommended

About 6 months ago I had a herniated disc and it required surgery This condition left me with nerve damage down my right leg In order for me to drive and or walk normally I had to wear a brach in my shoe because most shoes are too heavy for me to lift with my foot because my foot has minimal strength Now the ultra boost is too small for the brace But what I found out with the ultra boost I do not need the brace anymore The shoe has changed my life I do not have to wear a brace anymore I can drive normal and I can walk longer distances than before I have worn these shoes everyday since because with my condition wearing the brace was exhausting Now with the Ultra Boost I have truly have endless energy

The primeknit fits like a sock and the boost is just amazing

I love everything about UltraBoost from the Appearance all the way down to the Comfort You will definitely be pleased I already can not wait for my other shipment to come in

Absolutely the best white Ultra Boosts to date Love them

Amazing shoe for almost everyday use Would wear everyday beside when it rains

Looks good with everything recommend this shoe to everyone

Shoes are incredibly light and comfortable but within one hour of regular use of wearing them they were snagged Material is very flimsy and super easy to snag resulting in a shabby looking pair of very expensive shoes

Very good materials and feels great on the foot A little pricey but I think it is worth it

My husband

Ultra Boost are the most comfortable sneakers ever so I got my mom a pair and she loves it Style wise though I like the UB 1 0 and 2 0 better because the knit pattern is better and I prefer the solid cage rather than the translucent cage on the 3 0

Love the comfort of these shoes I started with the pureboost and decided to try ultraboost Definitely not disappointed

I usually wear a 10 5 to 11 but all they had was a 11 5 in stock and it turned out to be perfect Overall this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever wore

Great sneakers great quality never felt great comfort

Great shoes Sometimes extremely hard to find in stock

Extremely comfortable yet snug Icy look Love the contrast in whites throughout

These shoes are very comfortable and very stylish

Everything was amazing Wish price was a little lower

The width on these shoes is slightl different than the uncaged version but equally as comfortable

Really comfortable and a great looking shoe It fits true to size for me which was 1 2 size smaller vs boost 2 0

This shoe is very comfortable Great for styling and running

Love the UltraBoost and the way the cage is made on this styler rather than the others

Comfortable

These are by far the Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

This was a great fathers gift for my dad he loves them

you can not go wrong wearing these shoes very comfortable

Bought these shoes for my husband and he loves Ultraboost Great running shoes Five stars all the way xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f xe2 xad x90 xef xb8 x8f

Poorly made will never buy again they are good for comfort only not for running

Super nice shoe really comfy and a classic in the making My 3rd boost shoe and I really like the 2 0 version over the 3 0 hopefully adidas restocks some 1 0s

The Boost technology is superb Super comfy shoes

Very comfortable and go well with most of my clothing

Extremely comfortable and they look even better on feet

I use it for work and my feet are not tired at the end of the day after walking 22k steps

great

Most comfortable shoes I have owned Lightweight and good shock protection soles

This is my first pair of Ultra boost shoes The comfort level is high and they look good too In terms of sizing I wear 8 5 for the new pureboost and NMD pk so I ordered an 8 5 for this shoe The length is perfect but width is a bit tight I have wide feet so you may want to consider going half size up Alternatively you can take the insole out to give yourself more room

Son recommended these shoes great style quality and comfort

Best looking and most comfortable shoe adidas has out

Super comfortable I am looking to buy another pair already I love the shoes

This is a super comfortable super hip pair of shoes that I run in and wear casually I love them

If you go by European sizing the sizing is correct Sadly that sizing does not transfer to US sizing I am a 37 5 and normally a women7 5 in US sizing In adidas I am a 6 5 in women 

it is super comfortable the fit is great for an everyday wear

I heard it ran a little big because of the PrimeKnit so I went half a size down and it fits me perfectly In terms of comfort I do not think I could ask for anymore than the Ultra Boost offers

The only thing is the top sole part gets damaged

Very comfortable shoe If you are on your feet a lot these shoes help a lot



This is a shoe that is perfect at so many levels I love it

I have chronic hip and back pain I have noticed a great reduction in pain since wearing my ultraboost every day Bedt shoe I have ever worn period

Great shoes Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

Best shoe ever I am going to be wearing these for ever

The BEST shoes I have ever had in my life I HIGHLY Recommend them to ALL From a scale of 1 10 they are a 20

Adidas boost shoes are the best I own a pair of Nmdand Inikitoo

The best pair of shoes I have ever worn I could not have asked for a better pair to put on my feet

Comfortable when walking but kinda tight at top offoot

I like the performance of these shoes however I dislike how hot they make my feet

This is the ONLY shoe I have worn that is true sizing for me I typically go 1 2 to full size up from a 10 for width comfort All my shoes range that way I fit a size 10 comfortably and the PK material is excellent it is sock like without feeling like your feet are bound I could not find a pair in store or online so I incorporated this shoe into my recent you itinerary because I had to have it No regrets

Very happyand fits perfectly The Confirmed App is very lousy

Love the color and the collab itself is awesome Taking the plastic from the ocean is genius Love love love the boost

Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned they are a tad bit narrow if you have wider feet but the material stretches fine around them

Best shoes I ever owned Feels like walking on a cloud Look great Great for running

The shoe is very comfortable and the colorway is very nice The shoe is a little bit brighter than in the picture

Most comfortable shoe on the planet I hope these become easier to purchase I need more

Comfort Easy on the knees Support at the ankles Lightweight

looks and feels great I work 12 hours shifts and it really helps me get through the day

Very snug and comfortable fit Great design and great for exercise

The Quality and cushion are perfect Even though the size is a little bit smaller But it is still fits good

Very comfy but kind of expensive 4 5 stars out of 5

The most unique pair of ultra boost for 2017 A must haveD

Ultra boosts are the most comfortable shoes out right now

Best shoe ever This is my second pair I gave the chance of trying something else because of the low availability of the Ultraboost but nothing is comparable Thanks Adidas to put additional shoes in stoke I could not grasp a Barley cage pair sad face

My grandma says these are the most comfortable shoes she is ever worn and she is like 100 so she is been through some shoes As for me I have several pairs boost beats bubbles any day

The ultra boost is a great and outstanding shoe made by adidas

I got these shoes as a birthday present for my mom She loves the color on these and so do I She really thinks they are the most comfortable shoe on the market Also she loves the idea that they were also helping the environment a tremendous amount

The shoes are extremely comfortable I love that they are made from recycled material

Wish I would have read reviews to Size up Little tight

Very comfortable very balanced great durability the perfect shoe

The fit and look is amazing The shoe does run a little small but overall very happy with it

Great sneaker great look Love the concept of recycled ocean plastics

The most comfortable shoe I have worn True to size and good style

The shoe is great it just did not fit but I was only able to get that size

Beautiful color and great cause This shoe is pricey but worth every cent if you love Adidas and the planet

Very comfortable shoes Best shoes I ever purchased

looks good and they are super comfortable I would say they run a little small though Still one of the best shoes ever

Most comfortable shoes on the market in an amazing colorway

These shoes are awesome and for a good cause They fell very comfortable like all ultraboost that have been made

Boost and parley are a great combination Very comratable

Great quality just like all the rest ultra boost a little narrow and snug but not a real issue size up if you want a little more room in width

Love them good cause and a good shoe Love the color

Stabilizes my foot no more plantar fasciitis softest feel yet still provides maximum support

Great product with an awesome message Would love to purchase more from the Parley Adidas Collaboration

Status Cool Theses shoes are great But can be hard to get size 12 5

great recycling of materials love the idea and look forward to more of this

So comfy and eco friendly I love them so much Ty

It is the best shoes that I have found ever it is so cool

these boys is hot real quality stuff feels real tight though the pureboost fit much better but these look just too ill

Saving the world one shoe at a time Awesome collaboration Maximum comfort



These just feel more stiff than other 3 0s They look cool I think if I went 1 2 size bigger it would be fine possibly a full size

Look comfort color

Looks and feels amazing I have gotten a load compliments and looks from people

These shoes are the bees knees gotta love them yeah baby

I guess since these were made from recycled materials it made the sizing a bit off

it is the most comfortable not sacrificing style

It is a great shoe living up to the expectations I have set for Adidas Ultraboost

Excellent shoes The boost midsole is unbelievably comfortable and the they fit nearly perfect The only thing is that the toe box is a little tight from the compression of the upper I only wish that ultraboost were readily available in every color

I love the style of the shoe and the background behind the shoe really is a good looking shoe and like all ultraboost it is comfortable

Super comfortable and looks great but a little short in length

Materials are spot on Design is magnificent Just wish it was a 13

Very Comfortable I was fortunate to get one and feels lucky

The best running and everyday shoe I have ever owned can not imagine wearing anything else

The shoe provides a lot of cushion when running was true to size

The shoe is very comfortable However it is a bit snug A couple wears and it stretched out because you of the PrimeKnit I did notice a stitching becoming undone after the third wear of casual use

Love the ultra boost just wish a size 13 was available

The shoe runs very small on the feet which makes it hard to purchase right

it is a cool shoe recommended because it is very comfortable

The design is superb The shoe is comfortable and the colorway is spectacular

Nice shoes comfortable nice color Little tight a

Very comfortable shoe kind of tight but if you take the insole out or go a half size down you should be ok

I am now on my 3rd pair Ultra Boost is hands down the best distance trainer available The cushion leaves your body and feet feeling refreshed after pushing long miles I have turned several friends on to Ultra Boost now they will not run in anything else These are super popular if you see your size grab them because they will sell out fast

The concept behind the shoes is an awesome idea but Im not sure if it was because of the materials used the shoe felt smaller than other UB 3 0 that I have

Ultra Boost Wins I purchased this show and it was so comfortableI sometimes forgot I had shoes on Ultra Boost helped me run a little further a little faster I get compliments on my sneakers all the time I went ahead and bought a 2nd pair just because I can not live without these sneakers Ultra Boost wins again

When I received my ultraboost there was dryed on glue that will not come off

Need I say moreNeed anyone say moreThese are probably the most comfortable shoes ever made At least top 5 in the history of sneakers The Primeknit upper is unbelievably soft and stretchy to the point where it might be too stretchy for serious runners The Boost midsole is the thickest and most comfortable iteration of the technology the EQT Support 93 17 may have more Boost but not as balanced as these Wearing these feels like walking on clouds with the most comfortable pair of socks on it is pure magic do not hesitate when you see these restocked Buy them

The product is perfect purchasing was a pain I understand it was a limited item and all but the hassle was unnecessary Spend 3 and a half hours with 0 exaggeration online selecting size and doing the I am not a robot test to finally successfully purchase the item But the item itself is great so my boyfriend says



Incredible quality incredible cause The cage is almost reflective so it makes the shoe really pop

Size upwhen you buy these cause the plastic makes it not as loose

These shoes are amazing I am very fond of boost technology After wearing my CrazyLightBoost 2016 for basketball and buying NMD R1s for my wife I really had to try out the beloved Ultraboost Lemme tell you these are truly amazing They fit perfect on my feet and they are super light and breathable Primeknit is no joke either haha The only gripe I had with these shoes is that sometimes the supportive cage wrap end would poke onto the top of my toes I solved this by loosening the laces a bit I know this will not effect everyone but maybe it is something to keep in mind Overall these shoes are the best running casual shoes I have ever put on Thank you Adidas for making these I love these so much I have already bought two pairs Hoping to collect more down the road

Honestly my favorite shoes I have ever owned Comfortable and look great I am up to 5 different colorways and plan to keep adding Ultra boost are in my opinion the best shoes on the market right now

Great Shoes perfect fit very forgiving on the heels

The box design is goofy Shoe is super comfortable Shopping was lightning fast

I love ultraboosts and will buy them without a second thought However the Parley have a much different fit to them I am not sure if it is because of the recycled materials or what but the entire primeknit is much much stiffer than the regular UB It is much tighter around the top of the foot and you can not move your toes around as much as the knit is not as soft and flexible I had to order a full size up from the regular UB3 series Still debating on whether or not I want to keep them I still recommend them because the sole is still the best thing to happen to my feet in a long time

It fits snug and is very comfortable I love the fact that these shoes are helping save the environment

Just Love EveryThing Adidas Not To Mention The Rrcycled Material In This Shoe

The shoe runs bigger than my true size I am size 10 but has to get 9 5

Comfortable stylish eye popping colors The shoe is also made from recycled materials which is cool

I am a huge fan of ultraboost they are extremely comfortable

Need serious quality control and make sizing standadize

The pictures on Adidas website do not accurately represent the color that it actually is

The product looks and feels great The color looks better in person

Ultra boost are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned no contest keep doing your thing adidas

Great fit very comfortable shoe I would recommend to others

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn looks great too

I love them very comfortable They are very stylish while helping the earth at the same time

Love the collaboration with Parley great back story and very environmental friendly The wave inspired heel cup is eye catchy and the non translucent cage is a nice change The Parley branding is perfectly placed on the tongue caged and the heel pull uncaged and ALL the blues blend perfectly

Returned the shoe due to width problems Overall amazing shoe but constricting over the top of the ankles

It a beautiful piece od work but jus that it run a bit small

I have been a consumer of the ultra boost for sometime now and this collaboration with Parley is a must have for the casual or SneakerHead A footnote on these was that they were a little snug than normal I am assuming that the materials of using recycled flotsam and jetsam had a little play in the slight fitted issue than normal

Plz keep the boost coming they all amazing and the limited release have been fire

Parley ultraboost run smaller than regular 3 0 boost which makes them true to size since 3 0 have more room in the fore foot area

Cool design and colors but way too small and shoelaces are too short

Awesome shades of blue for summer Perfect fit Love the fabric cage

Colorway is on point and fits well great job Adidas

First pair of Ultraboost and will not be my last for sure

Comfortable and fits well Looks great too just laces are a little too bulky in my opinion

The coloring and quality are awesome Its nice to have a different product than all the rest out there

Great Love them I am a teacher and I feel like I am bouncing through my classroom all day My feet are no longer tired at the end of the day

Love the ParelyThe blue color really sells it

Love ultra boosts Best shoe out there Collaboration with Parley for a fire shoeWhy not

This shoe is AMAZING Parley is awesome and changing the world The color is really nice Boost is still the best cushioning in the world so overall this shoe kills it Love Love Love

Make larger sizes you are 12 5are more like 11 

A big too narrow and too tight They are comfortable but I recommend going up 1 2 size A bit overpriced in my opinion

I really love the design I personally hate caged ub but not this one Sexy and comfortable describes everything

The entire project from recycling trash from the ocean and ending up with a product that is this great just makes them a no brainer Great stuff Adidas Please keep up all the hard work

They cost a pretty penny but are worth the pretty penny They look really cool and are seriously the most comfy shoe I have ever owned If they could make my dress shoes ultraboosts my life would be complete

Awesome product The ultraboost line is one of the best shoes adidas has to offer Great comfort great design awesome cause

Very comfortable great color good to run in durable

The message Parley brings to sportswear really created a great atmosphere for the future of sportswear

Fantastic comfort I would recommend to anyone I love the ultra boost style

Fits 5 too small then regular ultra boost Should fix this problem and are drop them

Ultraboost is the best shoe on the market Parley is cool because they are helping the environment I wish the Parley Ultraboosts had their own special box though

Love the Ultra Boost Own several Love the multiple color options

It was too small i have another pair of UB of the same size and these fit too small

Too tight on the back part even after a half size up Need to go at least a full size up

Good quality and style Fit good and good value for the price

The Parley Ultraboost is another excellent collaboration with great quality The only grip I have is the fact they fit slightly tighter than the rest of my Ultraboostu200b shoes

These are the most comfortable shoe out there I tore my Achilles twice in a row and these shoes are perfect for me They have a soft back which is perfect for my Achilles These are very lightweight but very comfortable

I love the concept of the shoe Great looks Fits 5 small

The fact that this shoe is made out of plastic bottles amazes me I can tell almost no difference in comfort or quality from my other ultra boosts which is great Definitely my favorite pick up so far this year Keep doing what you are doing adidas

Another excellent colorway of the Ultra Boost The only negative is that the shoes are a bit tight compared with the other 3 0 colorways

Great shoe the Parley model fits snug for some reason Still wearable but I should have gotten a 1 2 size bigger

If you are getting these I would go a half size up Other than that it is an ultra boost the comfort and style is still there

Great innovative shoe and spectacular idea to use recycled materials

The comfort and the way the texture looks like waves in the ocean Every time I put them on I feel like I am at the beach

These seemed to be a bit below quality standards and missing boost cernels

Once again adidas hit it out of the park with this pair along with supporting a great cause I hope they continue the Parley movement with additional colors

Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Insanely comfortable lightweight and breathable and they look amazing

I do not think that these came out the way Adidas wanted them to

It is a good shoe overall and super nice design super comfy

My shoes sewing is messed up but I can not return it or else i can not get a replacement because they are out of stock

Incredible shoe with a wonderful message Looking forward to future Parley releases

Keep um coming Adidas and I am gonna keep buying You guys are crushing the sneaker game right now

I own three pairs of ultraboosts and they are all great Very comfortable and stylishyou can exercise in them or wear them out Highly recommend

love the ultra boost most comfortable shoe ever

Parley represents saving the environment in a cool fashionable way You can actually wear the change you are making right on your feet I love their concept and mixed with the Ultraboost the shoe could not get any better I really like the beautiful ocean color to these too It also goes without saying that the boost makes these extremely comfortable to wear

This Ultra Boost is overall a great shoe It has a very nice flowing primenit that goes with the foot and the boost adapts to your foot sole very quick to allow a very comfortable step My one flaw on the show is sometimes a peice of boost falls off Still overall this is one of adidas best shoes

The product is very comfy and is made of ocean material

It is an amazing product it is so soft unlike NMD or yeezy

Best shoe ever made Even better than the Jordan 

Best shoe made I strongly recommend to anyone I have a large collection of ultra boost and nmd

This is a great show would recommend for everyone

I have med wide feet and these run narrow and long Adidas sizes are inconsistent need to figure out there sizesAll different

Smooth and comfortable Plus the shoe i was looking forever

Awesome shoe Only one complaint and this is on every 3 0 is the plastic at the top of the toe box I know why it is there but makes it not as comfy as the 2 0

Best shoe in the market both comfort and aesthetic

Great PK material durable stylish good for standing

This is my first Ultraboost It is so comfortable

The new prime knit upper is superb and is super plus cannot recommend this shoe enough

The ultra boost is seriously the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I am definitely buying another pair

First ultra boost I have ever owned not the last man

These shoes are exceptionally comfortable Like walking on pillows Sometimes you forget you are wearing shoes at all it feels fantastic But the shoes also feel really secure and really hold your feet in place well when you are running You absolutely get what you pay for with these sneakers so it is not difficult to understand why they are so popular Runs true to size from my experience

Great service Fantastic shipping time Will buy again

They are so comfortable like walking on air The primeknit is so stretchy and form fitting

Super comfortable Addicted to boost since the first day I put my first ultra boost on

I bought these shoes for casual wear as well as going to the gym or for a run The day I got these I went to the gym and ran a little bit I looked at my shoes after and saw that the boost already ripped from just running

Ultra boost are the best sneaker on the market period Comfort feel everything

these are hard asf and mad stylish fam yuh yuh fam

Shoe felt great Went down a half size cause that is what a lot of people suggested but the fit was too tight Had return them but will be looking to purchase some other ultraboosts in the future

Comfortable And would highly recommend to a friend

Highly recommended it You will not believe how good it feels once you put them on It feels like you are wearing performance Socks on marshmallows haha

Best shoes I have ever owned so comfortable and they look awesome Been stopped a few time already people complimenting them Buy them if they are available

Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned do not like the new versions Would buy 10 pairs of these for the next few years if I could

Best Quality but need More Size 6 5 Please I wil buy today

Wish the ultra boost was not so hyped I probably would have had a much better initial reaction when putting them on for the first time

I really love the ultrabooost but it suck how they only do limited quantity

My first pair of Ultra Boost 3 0 and I am extremely satisfied Ive been the NMDlike crazy so I decided to give these puppies a try and they are stellar I would deff recommend going a half size down bc of the prime knit but still an incredible on foot feeling Thank you Adidas

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn do not be scared by the price tag as you will not regret the purchase have had these shoes for two days and I am so glad I made the correct decision I normally wear a size 13 but went down a size to get a snug fit The width is stellar the boost technology is second to none in my opinion Seriously am considering buying more of these shoes in the future Do try the shoes on before you buy is my only tip as sizing may feel different to various feet

I like the looks of them a lot but I did not get a chance to get them so please please please restock in these color

First off the UBare AWESOME Go a half size down due to the PrimeKnit being more stretchy I was a 12 in the 2 0so i picked 11 5 in the 3 0Great for anything you docasual gym work etc

I have owned the Ultra Boost 1 0 and 2 0 but for whatever reason they changed their sizing on this shoe I wear a 10 5 in everything but for Ultra Boosts 1 0 and 2 0s they fit small so I get an 11 When i got these in they were too long but i got the bottoms dirty so I do not think i can send them back

A1 Quality Easy cop Suprised this is still sitting

When I put this shoe on I could right from the first step that the hype and reviews lived up to what is been said They are now by far my go to shoe and definitely the most comfortable shoe that has ever been put on my feet Amazing job adidas I can not wait to buy more pairs

I bought these for running and they are the most responsive runners I have owned it is honestly difficult to run slow in them The return is remarkable The comfort is second to none The casual look obviously works too considering the demand for them My only request or suggestion is to design a performance minimal version with a lower drop 4MM to 8MM Similar to REDACTED Free Run Distance I would love to have that option Then it would be the only sneaker I would ever buy Other than the NMDobviously They are just fire

Was not satisfied The product I received was damaged

Great looks Incredibly comfortable lightweight etc

it is like stepping on cotton from a freshly shaved sheep

People were not kidding when they said that these shoes are the most comfortable pair that you will wear Very glad about my purchase

These are the most comfortable shoes on planet earth

They are so nice Best shoes I have ever owned comfort and look wise Love them

I like it because they go with everything that you put on

i like this shoe because it is super comfortable

This shoe combines comfort with quality attractiveness and overall excellence

Most comfortable shoe ever created Everyone should get at least one pair

I like a lot I like a lot I like a lot I like a lot

Super comfortable and great shoe Fit is true to size

This shoe is very comfortable and would recommend to anyone And just to say the 3 0 pattern is very nice as well as the color way it is self Overall Great Shoes

Make me very comfortable convenient and keep walking unlimited

It is a good shoe I am a 7 5 in other Adidas shoes but for ultraboosts I recommend going two sizes up

I have bought 2 pairs and 1 for my wife this past week Therefore I need more comfortability for feet

The 3 0 upper is way too stretchy for me Taking turns with these shoes makes my foot want to slide off the side Running in straight line and casual wear they are 5 stars And boost is the best cushion I have ever tried I also have a pair of the ST version that I prefer way better than the UB 3 0

So comfy and looks really nice Only problem is that it gets dirty easily

These ultra boosts are by far the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned and one of my favorites They have tons of support and cushioning on the heels while the knit mesh in the front really allows your feet to breathe when you are on the move They are a dream to wear for running but you gotta be careful since they are all white

Toe box is more squishy than 2 0 or 1 0 but believe it or not you get use to it It is the right amount of squishy I bought a 13 in the 1 0 which fit perfectly and should have bought my true size 12 5 in these Worth trying on before buying if you can

Very good perfect for my foot easy to put on feel comfortable while walking around

Feels great and looks great You will not regret that you brought them

Best shoe I have ever bought it Great comfy shoes

Brilliant Comfortable Really good shoe Recommend it to everyone I talk to

Terrible shoes So uncomfortable Ordered size 10 got size 5

extremely comfortable shoe highly recommend Just wish they were easier to get ahold of and on shelves for some colors

Very comfortable looks good on foot Would recommend to anyone looking for a new shoe

The product is very comfortable The product also has a perfect fit

They a very comfortable lightweight and breathable

Ultra boost are always a good look and always make a show worth looking at

Love the comfort of the shoeMakes every other sneaker feel stiff

These shoes are amazing I bought me a pair because I heard they were comfortable so I use them to cut grass Love these shoes

Go one half size down and take the insole outboostgod

These feel just amazing totally worth it you will not regret it

This is a fantastic shoe Extremely comfortable worth 180 dollars I bought one pair in August and bought another in December because I liked them so much

Everything about these shoe were great but since the cage is clear it scratches pretty easily Other than that this shoe is perfect

I love the ultra boost 3 0 I got the white and it is very comfortable

3 0 Prime Knit is very loose big miss I have three UB 1 0and 4 2 0The 1are hands down my favorite runners to date Prime knit on 3 0is very loose and does not hold my foot to the sole While walking it feels like my toes are going over the reinforced sides Running is not an option I have never had this issue with 1 0or 2 0I hope this is corrected ASAP

First of all I want to say thank you so much Adidas for creating the most comfortable shoe in the world it has help me a lot with my disability Oh my life I have been searching for comfortable shoe to help me take away my pain I suffer from chronic pain since a child I was paralyzed on my right side and had a major accident I had seven spinal neck surgeries And I have scoliosis in sciatica The ultra boosts sneaker has help me so much with my pain it relieves it when I walk I wish I can get more but unfortunately you guys never have my size and you always sold out I only own one pair and I cannot work because of my disability so I cannot buy them like that but thank you for making the most wonderful sneaker in the world God bless you

This is the most comfortable adidas shoes i have ever had and used

The 3 0 Ultra Boost are the most comfortable shoes that have ever been on my feet Hoping to buy another pair some time in our lifetime

does anyones pinky toe come off the corner when walking because of the meshlol I got this for christmas Its comfortable when walking but when i start running my pinky toe comes off the corner

This shoe is comfortable and you can wear it with anything People will recognize you in this shoe The only problem with the shoe is the quantity It restocks often but when it does it runs out quick it is sold out usually in stores and there is also people who resell the shoe for profit

This is the best Adidas shoe in the game right now It is comfortable and is very stylish

This is the most comfortable and versatile shoe ever

This product is great because the primenet and the boost goad really join together and make the shoe my favorite shoe EVER

The 3 0are the best UB to date interms of comfort but visually the 1 0are still the best I do not care for the greenish cage on the core black shoe It should have been black like the one on the womenversion As for sizing I normally wear a 13 in the 1 0 2 0 but I could easily fit in the 12 but opted with the 12 5 So yes they do run a 1 2 a size larger compared to the predecessor True to size can work if your using them casually but for running I would go down 1 2 a size I am looking forward to the triple black 3 0 as I missed out on the previous version That pretty much sums it up Keep up the good work Adidas

Really comfortable and good looking shoe but when the laces are really tight they start to chafe annoyingly

I love it is comfort Its so comfortable and i can not wait to get more

These are the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn

The most comfortable shoe I ever wore Mainly because of the upper primeknit and the boost cushioning

So comfterble they are great for running and it is easy to rock them with anything

I would and that is why I picked up the most comfortable shoes in the world

If you have the 1 0 or 2 0 ultra boosts and wish to purchase the 3 0s i recommend going a half size down I ordered the same size as I usually do and the 3 0material is a lot more stretchy and not as snug as the 1 0s nonetheless really comfortable shoes i plan on purchasing more colors

I used to be very active but over the year I have aged and slowed down This pair of shoes is walk in the air comfort it is hard for me to wear any other pair of shoes I even wanted to start running again

Hands down the best thing I have ever worn I bought one pair and immediately got 2 more

I was beyond excited when I got my first pair of Ultra Boost that I went ahead and bought a second pair I would definitely recommend these shoes I am officially hooked and I cannot imagine ever going back to any other type of shoe Thank you Adidas for making such a wonder product

The fit is a bit snug at first but because of the primeknit the upper begins to stretch and form to your foot after a few wears

The Boost sole was the best part of the shoe including the primeknit upper This is the first boost adidas shoes I have every bought and I am not regretting it

These are literally the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn The moment you wear these you go into another dimension These shoes are unreal and I am glad I made this purchase

It was too small and the shoe was big by toe would not get

Stylish and comfy Fits any gender perfectly Simple yet classy styles

The UltraBoost is my favorite shoe for this price

this item is perfect super cool super comfortable and light

Im feeling these These dope AF Adidas wayy better than nike

I like there sneakers so so much cause you Can wear Them to an Casual look but also to an hypebeast look and they are just the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn

Definitely part of my Top 5 Top 5 Top 5 All of a sudden fam

Awesome best shoes in world I wish I could get new triple black

Very comfortable shoe to the fabric and boost very well done

I Love it I Love this color I want it

Amazing and comfortable shoes Nothing will compare to these

I really like this shoe alot I own several pairs I even uncaged my reflective 1 0Looking forward to the triple black Hope I can successfully cop

The product is pretty much the most comfortable shoe on the market The primeknit upper allows for a free sock like feeling around your foot while the rubber cage or leather cage as I have the Olympic Gold Medal provides a lockdown fit for no slippage of the heel

This shoe has been very durable for me I have wore these all around Europe in my 3 week trip and I walked an average of 8 miles a day and they still look like new 7 months later I would really recommend to try them on in store first I wear an 11 in my Yeezy Boost 350 and a 10 5 in my Tubular Runners and I had to go with a size 12 Other than that terrific shoe

It is a good shoe and very comfy but runs narrow so for up half a size

These shoes were so great the first time I tried them on I really like the design and how the cage supports your foot when walking around I really enjoyed walking around in these shoes The material is great and this is the 2nd most comfortable shoe I have worn I have tried on the ultra boost uncaged and felt like the uncaged version let my feet free I love the design of the original though The cage seems perfect for style and support I was going to buy these but was not able to yet again because of the price I would love to own a pair and go walking and running

Ordered these after hearing about them being restocked They are pretty expensive but these shoes are extremely comfortable and have a premium feel to them I was pretty skeptical towards buying them at first but I definitely feel I made the right choice I recommend these to anybody looking for stylish and comfortable shoes

The shoes are extremely comfortable when I go on my exercise routine and when simply walking on a casual day When running you can really feel the boost working cushioning every single step especially since I land on my heels when running Best running shoe out on the market for meI will definitely be buying more pairs of the UltraBoost Just waiting for those triple black 2 0to drop

Easily one of the most comfortable shoes I have worn I was hesitant at first due to the steep price point but finally pulled the trigger and I do not regret it Super comfy all around from the cushioning to the material around the shoe Great for casual wear like how I use them

Perfect mix of style comfort and quality A true everyday shoe that can be worn in any situation

I ordered my ultra boost core black from the official adidas website and when I received it i noticed the upper dye on one shoe was lighter than the other Really disappointed after trying hard to get my hands on a pair Hope I can be compensated somehow

Comfort

I wore them once and the stitching that held the plastic to the inside of the shoe came undone I didnt even run in them Just walked around school I would return them but it is too much hassle Reluctantly keeping them Not happy with this purchase as they were extremely expensive

Very comfortable and looks nice Worth buying and using

The boost starts to fall off and not comfortable

The Ultra Boost has to be the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn Absolutely love the fit and style Half a size UP from your true fit is recommended as they are a snug fit Wish more were Pairs and sizes were available

This shoe is the most comfortable thing I have ever put on my feet and they have been a great addition to my collection have not run in them as they are much too nice for me to want to

Very Comfortable and good look I can wear them to run or just go out on the town

I love the product Perfect all around shoe Great for anything casual wear athletic wear etc

Great looking shoe but what makes the world of a difference is it is a COMFORTABLE great looking shoeUltraBoost

This shoe is really comfortable and also looks great

The quality and comfort is unmatched The ultra boost is something everyone should own

Amazing shoe Super comfortable and a great runner

Super comfortable shoe with max style Definitely as advertised

Most comfortable shoes that I own I would like them in every color now

The product is very comfortable and is a everyday wear

It really does feel like you are walking on a cloud

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever bought When people said this shoe was like walking on the on air they were not lying This shoe feels unlike any other shoe I have worn Make sure you buy the right size and be aware that people with very wide feet might feel the narrowness at first but the shoe will adapt over time

Comfort and quality and color is onpoint as always

These shoes are so hard to get so I am glad I was able too Any adidas with boost technology are by far the most comfortable of any athletic brand

Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Definitely recommend to any shoe lover looking for some swag

Very comfortable product the continental soles give the such grip my only thing is that once they get dirty they are hard to clean

Great comfort and style A little narrow than what I expected but overall good purchase

The shoe looks great and feels great initially but is a little tight and narrow and definitely gets dirty easily More of a lifestyle shoe than performance

got them for my son and me loves them Very comfortable

Honestly one of the most comfortable running shoes I have ever put on my foot True to size and the materials are supreme Bought these to wear to work but they are too fresh to get dirtied up

Shoe is not fit for people with wide feet buy one size larger if you really want this product

Wave is the worst thing to ever happen to Boosts This would be the perfect boost if it was 1 0 design but the wave is so ugly

Very soft and comfortable Would recommend buying if you like a comfortable and reliable shoe

I hope Adidas continues to make the regular Ultra Boost as right now it is tough to find them on the website in my size 10 5 I would also like to see them in loud colors bright greens yellows oranges and maybe even glow in the dark for night time running

best shoe on the market right now 3x whites other than yeezys best shoe out right now

Everything about the shoe is great except the sole wear Sole seems to wear down extremely fast on the pavement Hopefully can be corrected since the shoes are on the expensive side

Honestly these are the most comfortable pair of shoes to ever hit my feet and on the concrete

The perfect shoe comfort wise and aesthetically A must cop

What else can you add that hasnt already been said the boost technology is incredibly comfortable and the shoe is stylish A adidas

This shoe is comfortable well made and good looking

I have been an adiddas customer for many years have never had any problem with any products always consistent good quality materials I have a 2 year old daughter who wears her superstars on the daily bases my wife and I have matching pairs as well we have track suits sweaters tees I have a little boy on the way and he will definitely be wearing adidas gear as well Ultra boost are my go to for comfort and style

The shoe is so comfortable and fits perfectly to my feet Plus super clean and stylish

The adidas ultra boosts is the most comfortable shoe I have ever bought

These are THE MOST comfortable shoes I have ever owned in my life Hands down no question I have had foot and knee issues the last couple of years and with the Ultra Boosts I have had no issues at all because of the boost soles and knitted forefoot which does not smush my feet it is also very breathable and flexible The boost cushion is a freakin mazing It may be a bit pricey to some but think about it as an investment on your knees feet in the long run The bonus of owning these is that they are stylish as well so you can wear them anywhereBoostForLife

The shoes are very comfortable and beautifully crafted

Great product go and get a pair definitely worth it

Comfortable nice looking good shoe good brand

it is the most comfortable shoe on the planet and perfect for going places where you will be standing for a long time

Very comfortable shoes but unfortunately mine fell apart after 4 months of light wear The sole has come almost completely detached from the upper Very disappointed given how expensive these are

Excellent shoe Like wearing a pair of slippers Nice

These triple white Ultra Boosts are more impressive in person than in the pics Really bright and clean looking And yes they are the most comfortable boosts I own Great job Adidas

Great fit tight if you are not wearing thin socks

This is a must to get essential to walking the earth

Very clean looking shoe all while being extreamly comfortable

Most comfortable shoe ever made Highly recommend

These are the most comfortable shoes out there I am on my feet everyday for 8 hours and I love to wear them everyday

my feet and legs usually hurt after an 8 hour work day I rarely get a chance to sit down since I work in a busy pharmacy My feet and legs do not feel as achy as they used to when I did not have these shoes They are extremely comfortable The only negative about these shoes is that they are very squeaky when I walk through the hospital

it is comfortable and stylish it is what everyone wants in a sneaker

Fits great and I can wear for hours on hours days

Enjoy this product because of the comfort and durablity The boost technology is far more comfortable then the Nike Free technology

The most comfortable shoe ever and I should have bought Boost when they first came out

These were the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn but the outsole wears out so quickly and I cant afford another pair

This product is amazing one of the most comfortable shoes I own The all white color way is perfect to make an impression

Most comfortable shoes I have worn so far In them all day while at work Raises my self esteem knowing I have the freshest shoes around while not sacrificing comfort

Overall the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn I have 5 pairs of ultra boost and will continue to buy more colorways

Comfort is unmatched Little thin in construction The white is WHITEtough to keep it that way

Amazing sneaker feels like you are walking on air

Comfy and stylish I can not wait to get more in different colors

love them for work every day i am on my feet all day

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought just bought my second pair

Very comfortable shoe the boost feels amazing its like walking on a cloud The shoe is very nicley designed love the look are very dirbale You can tell its great matieral and durable Only reason i gave it a 4 was because i have flat feet and these are really good for thay except when i walk really fast or a long distance my feet will start to burn I did not expierence that in the under armour speedform vwnts that i had Not matter how fast i walked or how much long of a distance Maybe once or twice i felt like when i walked fast it was about to start but when i slowed down it was good And the speedform apollo vent keep you feet straight and are designed tobbe a naturall shoe Anyway great job adiddas iam fully satisfied just could be a little better for flat feet and yes i know you have the adidas hltra boost st but those look like a ugly tennis shoe no offenese These are the best looking ones add st to this that would be nice

Show was a bitt narrower than I had hoped and not as stable as i was thinking

I had already bought a pair of Adidas Boosts about four months ago and I was absolutely blown away by the comfort I do a lot of walking and these shoes are like walking on a foam mattress I have many athletic shoes some of them I bought for their style but some are not very comfortable I have been buying Adidas shoes since 1971 and have always found them very comfortable regardless of the style My first pair of adidas were Gazelles

This is the most comfortable shoe i have ever put on most people i know will agree with me A

Most comfortable fit like a glove overall a perfect shoe

Most comfortable shoe Ive ever worn beats any running shoe that ive worn to date It takes a while for them to break in and mold to your foot but after that youll never want to take them off

Very comfortable They run little small half size up

This product is great I can wear these casually and they look great Love these shoes

The purpose of this appraisal is to evaluate the Adidas Ultra Boost running shoe based on three criteria These criteria include comfort durability and performance With the latest technology integrated into their product Adidas claims that the Ultra Boost is currently the best running shoe on the market Therefore the targeted market for this product is frequent runners30 miles per week

A little tight across the arch of my feet But is starting to stretch out as they break in Also this particular color way is about a full size smaller than normal similar to nike

In less than a week after wearing these less than 5 times the stitching along the ankle has come undone

The Ultra Boosts are great shoes with two critical flaws in my experience if you are using them as running shoes 1 Primeknit durability and 2 sockliner quality

most comfortable shoe i have ever purchased they look great when worn casual as well i have 9 pair the upgrade to continental soles has been nice believe the hype

Very light very comfortable very cushy I love the styling I would love to see some more with the midsole colored

They look sick and I was looking for a successor to the flyknits I usually jog in These are better and nicer looking

The most comfortable shoes i have ever had and my favorite Adidas shoe

Nice looking shoe and the boost technology is the best to walk on The only thing is they are a little narrow at the toes

Ultra boost has easily become my go to Comfort is incredible only wish they were easier to buy colors sell out too quickly This is my second pair and I can not wait for more Fits like a sock true to size very lightweight

Best adidas shoes I have ever worn This shoes hands down look and feels comfortable

Most comfortable shoe I own I am a fan of the silhouette Great quality

Love the ultra boost comfort when you walking with it But when you are driving sometime you will start feeling the plastic strip on the side It will start giving you some uncomfortable feeling and which turned into annoying love you driving long distance But it is a best pair of walking and running shoes that you can every own

The color is too bright does not look the same the color in the picture

Unlike all the hypebeasts out there I actually run in these with that said I can say that these are the most comfortable running shoes I have ever had very comfortable They also give you that spring in your step you need for running 10 10

mesh over the front toe area is not supportive enough On a down hill run my foot slides forward laking enough stability That said it is the most comfortable run in my life Looking for a different model with more support up front with the same comfort HHmmmmm

I will start by saying I bought these for running and casual wear I am really excited about these shoes They are extremly soft and have responsive cushioning I did not get what that meant until I actually put in the running miles I live in the city so mainly I run on hard pavement and these bad boys did everything right when your foot hits the ground it supports all of your foot and not just the heel and when your ready to go up for the next stride it is really good at responding to that I urge those on the fence as I was for three months to get them Worth the expense if it does not dent your wallet so badly Also for my fellow sneakerheads these look great with joggers jeans and khakis no question they are worth the hype

Shoes are comfortable but for wide feet its not great

I have a hard time finding running shoes and these are the most comfortable Ive found

I have been wearing this shoe casually for the past 2 weeks and I could not be more happy with it The shoe is unbelievably comfortable it is great for people who have come off of knee surgery It provides the shock absorption that I so desperately need Big ups to Adidas for making a quality shoe

I love Ultra Boosts They are my second favorite shoe next to the Yeezy Boosts because they are so stylish and comfortable I probably wear Ultra Boosts 5 days a week

They are super comfortable and look great My new shoes for the NFL season go COWBOYS

They are the best shoes I ever owned and I love it

I will not talk trash about the shoes I know they are the best pair of shoes I have ever worn Just make them them last longer than 2 months

I have two pairs of the Ultra Boost and both have torn in the exact same spot I have worn each pair a maximum of 10 times to work nothing strenuous and neither held up to simple walking Very disappointed

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn and I have been running for over 40 years

I have a normal foot I wear all kinds of shoes The Ultra Boost is unnecessarily tight over the top of foot and in the toe box I was excited but my heart sank No dice for the Ultra Boost and the Ultra Boost Uncaged looks terrible so no reason to even try it on

This shoe will help you run faster stronger and longer distance The comfort it provides is second to none

These shoes are honestly amazing The fit comfort and ride are all perfect and these shoes are amazingly comfortable One gripe that I do have though is that they are slightly flimsy In fact my cage tore within a week of wearing these shoes So watch out for the durability because these should last much longer considering the price tag

The fit look and comfort of this shoe is spot on However I have never worn a shoe that repeatedly makes my feet so hot I either have to stop running or switch them out half way through the day due to discomfort A problem I have never had with other running shoes I thought these would breathe really well with the mesh upper but it does not seem to be the case For the price I can not say I would recommend these

I work for adidas and I am also and everyday runner I love this shoe but I am getting sick of the shoes not being in stock I for one run in the shoes like its intended purpose unlike the people who wear them for fashion My pair I have now are banged up and I need new ones But it seems like every time they restock it is all gonna I do not know what to do anymore This is frustrating

Great shoe Been wanting to try boost and it was worth it I really wish they had something like this for basketball though

Because ultraboost size for men is no longer suitable for me

Most comfortable running shoe I have ever bought Usually I have to size up a 1 2 size on adidas but this is nice and roomy

Other than narrow width this is a superior shoes

They are a bit too narrow After running a few miles I injured my feet due to the fact that they are too narrow I really wanted to love these shoes but after this painful experience I can not I have tried many adidas shoes before and i have never had this problem Maybe I got the wrong size I do not know but I can not wear them again to run

This is my second pair I really like the addition of the Continental rubber much better traction and feels more durable Ultra Boost is the best distance running shoe I have ever had I notice much less impact on my body after long runs It is idea for steady pace tempo running

I like the product But I would like the ability to customize it or be able to buy it in all black

I love the boost technology the shoe is so comfortable it is so light but Adidas you just need to restock more of these can you guy email me about this shoe when it will restock again

I like this shoes because it is really comfortablexe2 x9d xa4

Best shoe I have ever worn and owned More comfortable than a comfort slide

Favorite shoe ever If you get this it is worth your mony the quality prime nit uper feels amazing once on your foot

They are a perfect shoe They fit perfect Love them

Boost is everything Great shoe to walk in and exercise One of the most comfortable shoes ever like no joke I bought these true to size for my foot and thank god the size and fit were perfect The only reason why I say that because it is so hard to even try on these shoes in store They either have them but not my size With some adidas shoes I have to go a half size down and sometimes up But if you like the snug fit I would go true to size for this running shoe Im definitely gonna try to get another pair

Lightest most comfortable trainers on the market

Great shoe Great style Must buy at least a half to full size bigger than your normal size

Fit and quality of the shoe is perfect My only complaint is the comfort I like to do 10 mile runs in the morning and I fould this shoe to be way to comfortable 

Well just like everyone says These kicks truly are incredible and comfortable Worth the investment

When I got these the moment I tried them on a fell in love with them

Super comfortable and great looking By far the best shoes I have ever worn

See what nike has

compared to free runs these breathe better so my feet do not get hot Very comfortable shoe it is also very low The new support for the 2 0 feels great

Typically when it comes to kicks I wear Nikesthat aspect of my life was a complete mistake I can say without exaggerating that the Ultra Boosts are the best and most comfortable shoes I have ever flexed on my feet My swag has exponentially grown since I purchased them and coincidentally they knock about 3 minutes off your mile time They look and feel awesome and I will run in them until the soles fall off

Major sneaker head and they are the greatest shoes I have ever owned

I uncage the shoes and after 5 wears to school the sole seperated one day in PE The shoes are now unwearable and were a complete waste of money and wish I could just return them

I do not use the shoes for sport but a great shoe for casual use in the summer

it is very comfortable shoes fit is too tight color is too whitey price is expensive

They are so comfy and look very good I have the all white ones and get constant complements about them

The boost technique is fantastic Very comfortable to walk and run Highly recommended

This is my everyday go to shoe there is nothing that compares to the comfort of the ultra boost Not only the technology behind it but the pure aesthetic of the model leaves all of its competitors in the dust

the shoes are super comfortable really recommand

The shoe not only fits great and looks great but the comfort of the shoes is untouchable

Best shoes I have ever bought Totally worth it because no other shoe is this comfy The quality of the shoe is so good that it makes your foot fit like a sock

The shoes are awesome after you break it in a little I would give it 5 5 on every category but the boot dug a little bit onto my upper foot After wearing it for a bit it started to loosen up The cushion is great and the design is very nice I can see why it is sold out in many places looks great wearing it causally or running in them

Love these ultra boosts the boost sole is like walking on pillows Had to go 0 5 up for the length to be good Shoe fits pretty snug around foot initially but loosens up with use Highly recommend especially for running

These are the second most comfortable shoes i have ever worn NMDs fit my foot better but I have heard other people say that NMDs are the second most comfortable for them

do not EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT HAVE ABOUT 7 PAIRS

Great shoe for people who need neutral running shoes Very comfortable but if you are an over pronator you should look into shoes that offer more structure On the other hand they look really cool so you can wear them as everyday shoes Not a lot of other running shoes can fit that roll

Last August I bought my first pair of Ultra Boosts I had done my first 1 2 Marathon that month in a pair of Response Boosts and when I decided to train for my first full marathon which I did in January I thought I would better buy the best Boost Adidas offers After putting about 500 miles on them a friend of mine who is a runner advised me to get another pair as I am training for marathon2 next month I took them pair2 out of the box and literally did a 9 mile run and their was no working them in at all Pure comfort right out of the box I do not know what slight modifications have been made to the latest model as opposed to the ones I just bought but the 2nd pair seems to tie better and hold my foot in place

I love this shoe it is the most comfortable runner I have ever used But the thing is there is way too much hype I just need to buy a black pair of ultraboosts for running however there are sizes available there is not my size The reason being is hypebeasts wanting several shoes to resell I just need one pair Just one Other than that this is the GOAT Please make enough quantities so that people who actually use the shoe can get them without worrying about resellers bots and hype beasts

it is a good shoe mostly hyped but if you like it go for it

this shoe is so amazing that i do not think that I am walking actually

Great shoe great cop you kust but comfort is phenomenal in every way imaginable

The gradient pattern feels a bit thinner than the OG whites that came out in 2015 but the continental soles lasts longer The fit is a bit more roomy I recommend these This is a great sho3 for summer it is like clouds on my feet

Comfortable quality materials and looks great But because of the color I definitely will not be working out in them

Purchased this shoes as soon as I got notifies in Twitter due to the comfort and style of the shoe

So I have mostly worn Nike for running and training but the ultra boost is indeed more comfortable The prime knit is very nice breathable more of a sock like material to flyknit and keeps my foot in place prob the cage as well compared to my racers The only thing I probably have an issue is that the outer sole does not really last too long Personally I use the shoe for training

Anything with adidas boost technology has an amazing feel Add the ultra post silhouette and prime knit material and you too may have a new favorite sneaker I highly recommend

The hype is huge but the comfort and sizing is all off And why make shoes that gets put on like socks with lacesChoose one socks or laces can not have both Making it impossible to fit and if I get a size bigger makes me look like clown feet My friends told me the most comfortable shoes ever But personally to me it was one of the most uncomfortable shoes

The Ultra Boosts are incredible I did not buy them to run or work out in just for style but I will definitely be buying a second pair for those uses They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I feel very relaxed when wearing them The soft foam like insides are great I am very satisfied with my purchase Adidas really stepped it up with this line and have satisfied many people

Amazing I have the first Core black ones and the first all white ones can not say anything about them other than the white ones get dirty really fast which is going to happen if you wear them These new ones are really solid They have a little more weight on them but the sole is really solid The old ultra sole tends to wear out pretty fast This new continental sole is insane I also have nmdand these are way more comfy One of my top shoes for sure

Best running shoe ever Super comfortable and stylish

I both this shoe like a few months ago and if your looking to by a shoe that has boost this the one they are so comfy they are the way more comfortable than any Nike I can not go back to no free runs these are the top

Shoes are so comfortably its unreal I bought them A To run in but To have a comfortable shoe for my long shifts at the hospital The Ultra Boost design is literally no joke I have been uber pleased with this purchase Wish they could be a little bit lighter but would not trade the cushion to make shoe more lightweight

a very comfortable shoe for walking and running will not disappointed well worth the money sizing wise stay true to size the fit on ankle is little bit tight but is normal

could not ask for a more comfortable clean shoe to wear anywhere

So Clean and Beautiful

love the shoes but i was wondering i have 2 pairs and one fits great and the other with the continental thread at the bottom is a bit tighter is that how it is supposed to be

The ultra boosts are by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever had and they are gorgeous

Had to get these looked comfy and they were I might get the grey ones if they ever restock

My ultraboosts arrived today and I went to try them on right away but they were not what I expected they felt a little to tight and the part where your foot enters the shoe seemed to be squeezing my ankle a little too much who knows maybe they will loosen up but for now not as comfortable as everyone says

I love the shoe it is self but the knitting gets dirty super fast and not many things can clean it

Pretty good product but I recommend going a half size bigger for a better comfort

These Ultra Boosts are all the hype and then some The most exciting shoe I have ever worn

it is a great shoe but the shoe runs a little small

Boost is the best technology I ever seen on a shoe grate for long walks perfect for running and amazing for everyday use I highly recommend these shoes to anybody fits through the size and the boost is just amazing

works great on myshort and long runs enjoyed them since my first run

If you saw any of the original ultra boost you would be surprised You you will be surprised because the old colors looked so appealing to the eye but these new colors are trash Exsurcharge the all white or all gray

Soft and comfortable is true but the quality check need to be improved

Can wear with anything

They are light and and comfortable at first The boost the material looses it spring quickly and its feel becomes a bit stale the sole does not last very long after a month of use the soles where already worn to the boost material wish they were designed with a tongue instead to be able to control how the knit material presses against the top of your foot

This is the best shoe shoe I have ever owned I have gone from NIKE to Adidas over night The Ultras boost is a must

PLEASE ADD DIFFERENT WIDTH OPTIONS FOR WIDER FEET Adidas

I have two pairs of these and they are all i wear They are insanely comfortable i believe these should be in everyones rotation my mother even owns a pair

The most comfortable shoe I have ever put on I have a decent amount of shoes and the ultra boost by far is the most comfortable If you are thinking about getting them do it It is a great shoe and the ultra boost sells out pretty fast So if a store has your size scoop them up

From the moment I tried on my first pair I was immediately addicted I have never in my 29 years felt a shoe this comfortable period

The shoe is amazing running on hard pavement My knees do not hurt after running

I bought these sneakers because of all the great reviews and sneaker of the year awards from multiple web sites The sneaker is very good looking however it is nearly impossible to get your foot into it The length is perfect but it is just simply too tight for the average man to get his foot into Quite frankly I would think it would be hard for any female to get her foot into it And for the people who say it fits like a sock I recommend you get new socks because you are probably cutting off the circulation in your foot Again great looking sneaker but avoid at all costs

The Adidas ultra boost shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have ever had I am a long and triple jumper and this shoe makes me feel so light and bouncy as if i were running and jumping on clouds If you ever want to send any gear i will be more than happy to accept it

These are the best shoes that I have owned in my life I have owned other brands These were my first pair of Adidas in 20 years The last 5 purchases since this one have been Boosts Nothing compares to this cushioning

The greatest runing shoe everTrue It is Period The only great problem I see with these are if you are rockin them slick white ultra boost and they get dirty I do not know how to clean it HELP ME

I have three pair of the ultra boost shoes and its my favorite shoe out right now They look awesome and are one of the most comfortable shoes ever I run a lot and have used them to train in but I just do not like messing them up

I got a size 9 but am going to get a 9 5 when they restock But that being said I am keeping the size 9 I got I will recommend them to people

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had These were the 1st pair of Adidas I have had in 20 years TWENTY I have always been getting Nikes and the last 5 shoes I have bought were the other colorways of this shoe

It us SOOOO comfortable Makes me realize how my comfort standard have been so low for so long

I get compliments all the time I was kind of shocked by that because I usually wear Jordanand stuff and these shoes get the most compliments They run very small tho I have read reviews that said they run big that is very false in my case I wear a 10 10 5 in Nike I have wide feet and the 11 5 fits perfect I love these shoes and they are very comfortable Better than any other shoe I have worn

The ultra boosts are one of my favorite shows Very comfortable and look amazing Recommend this product to everyone

Just got my pair in and they are amazing My little brother just got a pair and he loves them as well We both have slightly wide feet and all shoes do not accommodate us but these are fine width wise tight out of the box across the midfoot area but all I had to do was loosen the laces slightly

I am a high school cross country track runner going around 30 miles a week I was skeptical in buying adidas for distance running but I was impressed for the first few weeks After a while though they started to feel too narrow and my toes started hurting Not sure how this could be fixed but I would love to see an ultra boost 2 with a wider sole Overall a good shoe though

I have been a runner for a while starting in high school playing lacrosse and these are by far the best running shoes that I have owned Many other brands have tried to achieve lightweight shoes that are also durable and have failed Adidas came through with comfortable light shoes that are durable under use Highly recommend

I have ordered two pairs one white and one gray They are awesome shoes to wander around the city on a dry day taking a run at the gym or to just have on around the house or office They look hella good too

Swapped the laces for 3M laces

I love these shoes they look and feel great it is like walking on clouds Running is so much better with the ultra boost Te amo adidas Be mine on Valentine 

While the price can run some people away I can tell you with all confidence that this shoe is quality at its best I did not have any issues with this running shoe It feels great and performs better the boost technology offers only the best comfort the shoe is durable with a look that supports the shoe through where ever you go I would highly recommend this shoe this is a must have for any serious runner trust me you get what you pay for

The most comfortable shoes ever Although they might be too snug I suggest ordering half a size down

They run true to size and really have nothing they need to change I have been looking for a good running shoe for the longest and I think search is now over

Ultra boost are the most comfortable runners I have owned Best runners hands down

I personally really enjoy this shoe I use it not just for running but for everyday travel it goes with almost everything and he prime knit and boost tech combo is a work of genius I have a wider foot and I would recommend that you go a half size up if you do too

good good

it is will be more comfortable if they have wide sizes

The shoe fits very snug which I am a personal fan of However the snug fit is not for everyone I like everything about the shoe no issues Just be aware that they do fit very snug because of the primeknit upper

Absolutely remarkable shoe feels like your Dell Beckham in any situation best shoe ive came across and im on my feet all day everyday with that ups

These shoes are just amazing Not only do they look good they also are super comfortable However the price is a bit steep on these but the comfort just makes it so worth every penny The primeknit on the new Continental version gets fuzzy real quick so just be aware of that Also do not forget to pull the tongue and the heel tab when putting these on because I accidentally ripped something in the shoe to which I can not seem to find lolme Anyways these are definitely a MUST COP shoe

The sole last longer

They are narrow they run 1 2 a size big to your gender The boost technology is impressive I have the all white colorway and this shoe turns heads The sole holds up the rest of the shoe and I really like the material on the top of the shoe The laces are very soft and all around it is a great shoe for all of the seasons Adidas you had people turning heads last year and I have been saying 2016 is your year

This is the most comfortable shoe I have even put on my feet They fit very narrow so if your feet are anything but narrow you might want to size up Your best bet is to go try on a pair of them on in a store

I am happy

most comfortable shoe i ever worn the boost technology feels like your not stepping on the ground cant wait to see what in store in the future for boost shoes

I like the way it fit and very comfy for running

I have been buying Air Jordanand Nikes for nearly 2 decades that could be coming to an end The Ultra Boost could is the most comfortable shoe I have ever tried on The hype is real

The ultra boost does not only look great on feet it is super comfortable

I wear these because I want cushion These are not minimalist shoes it is for someone who wants cushion I feel I have to repeat that again because who complain are not understanding the purpose of the shoe The shoe is my go to shoe if I want to run on the treadmill run outside train at the gym and while I do errands on the weekend I have 5 pairs and have stopped wearing other brands The UBs are extremely comfortable and because I rotate between several of them I have not seen the wear and tear that some have complained about

Obviously there is a bunch of hype behind this shoe Took me about a year to catch it stocked in my size and it definitely lives up to the hype and then some

The ultra boost is a very comfortable shoe and the small white color way just makes it even better

Great pair of shoes

This shoe is extremely comfortable like walking on a slice of soft pillow Ive worn them for 10 hours straight before and my feet were extremely comfortable the entire 10 hours Strongly recommend for runners or anyone looking for a comfortable everyday shoe

One of the best runner I have ever owned I would highly recommend

I have worn all kinds of Nikes from flyknits to airmaxes and none compare to the comfort level of this shoe The primaknit makes it feel like you have nothing on while the boost sole adds to the comfort Continental Streatchweb gives unbelievable traction Not only are these shoes comfortable but also look great so you can rock them anytime I was skeptical at first but truly am sold after wearing these for a few days Run a bit small so I would recommend half a size up

Adidas is the best can not wear any other non ultra boost shoes

AVID RUNNER FOR YEARS LOOKING FOR A CUSHIONY SHOE THAT DIDNT FEEL LIKE IM EVEN WEARING SHOES I FOUND THESE AND RAN IN THEM AND FELL IN LOVE ABSOLUTELY BUT AFTER MY SECOND RUN IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE MATERIAL ON THE TOP IS STARTING TO FRAY A THREAD AT THE TOP CAME LOOSE ON THE LEFT SHOE TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOE DEBATING ON WHAT TO DO FOR THE PRICE I FEEL I SHOULD RETURN THEM BUT IS THIS BOUND TO HAPPEN DUE TO THE MATERIAL

It is super comfortable with the prime knit and the boost never goes out which I love

I have never ever left a review on a product until today when I got these as was so amazed just how conformable they are it like your walking on clouds it is amazing I am wearing these as much as I can never wear same shoes 2 days in a row before these I wore them for 4 days straight I 100 guarantee you will be happy with these I am buying the all white ones as well

it is the best shoes

This shoes is perfect for me its not only a running shoes but it is one of the best sneaker of all time I felt so comfortable and happy when wearing this running sneaker everyday I highly recommend it worth each penny

I own 3 pairs and at the same spot on every pair where my big toe touches the knit material is starting to unravel A hole is in the making It sucks because it is a very comfortable shoes I just wish that the top material is a little bit sturdier

it is like adidas went to a cloud ripped a piece off and made into a shoe xe2 x98 x81 xef xb8 x8f xe2 x98 x81 xef xb8 x8f xe2 x98 x81 xef xb8 x8f

I went to a specialty running store in order to buy some new running shoes I tried on shoes from every brand they had and when I put on the Ultra Boost I knew they were the one for me The comfort is unreal The upper fits just like a sock and the boost midsole is cushioned yet not mushy I went on a 11 mile run straight out of the box No break in at all required although you do have to be careful about not lacing too tightly The plastic frame will definitely dig into your foot if you lace tightly The good fabulous comfort without losing ground feel These are cushioned and responsive at the same time which I thought was impossible There is one HUGE negative though I have literally been on two runs with these shoes I grand total of 18 miles The nubs on the sole are at least half way gone and I am guessing when they are all the way gone the traction will take quite a hit Not exactly what I need in an Ohio winter Adidas is there any plan to modify the material the nubs are made out of I love these shoes EXCEPT showing wear at 18 miles is just not acceptable I am not a pro or extra hard on shoes by any means 51 yrs old 6 0 178 lbs approximately 30 miles per week

Even though the shoe was a little pricey I was very pleased with my purchase The shoe offers a great style for running or just the casual trip out The color I received navy matches well with most outfits The neon green aglets became my favorite design feature of the shoe and the boost material makes the running experience top notch

These ultra boost are the most perfect shoes ever Great fit AMAZING cushioning and the upper is unbelievably awesome You can run in these look good in these casually and workout in these What more can you want Best shoes ever The only shoe I have been wearing since I got them Super Durable too The only con is the outsole however Other than that they are perfect

After hearing so many good things about this shoe I had to get my hands on a pair I could not believe how comfy they were I have been a sneaker head for a long time and never experienced anything like this from any other brand It was like walking with memory foam on your feet Now if you could make a waterproof boost for the NW that would be amazing

Boost is one of the most amazing cushioning systems I have ever experienced This colorway is clean and eye catching

I am not a runner I work a manual labor job anywheres from 60 to 84 hours a week I own 60 pairs of shoes I had been wanting to try the ultra boosts for awhile but was putting it off I finally ordered a pair and as soon as I put them on I immediately ordered another pair I now own four pairs of ultra boosts and they have become my go to favorite shoe They are so comfortable I have worn every kind of shoe and sole combination on the market Most shoes with the latest and greatest technology I personally could almost never feel a difference until I put on an ultra boost This shoe really may be in my opinion the greatest shoe ever made So if your debating on buying a pair take the plunge it is worth it

Best purchase I have ever made Fits true to size and the primeknit upper fits your foot exactly like a sock The boost midsole is the most responsive thing I have ever run in the energy return into my stride is ridiculous I over pronate and have flat feet so I have been running in stability shoes for a long time but I feel like this help correct my pronation issues naturally without a big bulky forceful medial post The boost midsole works with your feet and adapt to your natural stride to boost your run and it works

I recommend this shoe to anyone and this shoe is for people that understand what comfort is all about because this shoe actually cares for your feet and I own 3 pairs and still planning on buying more everyone should own at least one of these

Bought these for the actual shoe not the hype behind it and it is amazing

The shoes are absoutely unrea Very stylish Always getting compliments

Went a half size up from a 10 5 to 11 but this shoe is unbelievably comfortable and I made the right decision Yeezy taught me well this shoe is like walking on a clouds

If you are looking a comfortable sneaker this is the shoe to get

The off white and white combination could not have been executed more perfectly than this Great job on really making this shoe stand out The technology behind it speaks volumes I have not been this excited about a Adidas release since the shell toes and Xenos

I can not praise the Ultra Boost enough I now have 4 pairs and they are my ultimate go to favorite shoe I wear them casually but sometimes I am on my feet as long as 8 12 hours in a day I have done this in the Ultra Boost and can honestly say the comfort is A I have owned hundreds of shoes as I have been collecting since 2002 but have never owned a shoe this comfortable by any brand

at first i was skeptical and thought the price was too much but let me say these things are worth well over retail Absolutely amazing

I bought my pair of Ultra Boost back in April and now have over 300 miles on them The shoes have far exceed expectations I have been running exclusively in adidas boost products for over two years now When these were coming out for release I was a little bit skeptical mainly due to the price I got to run a couple of test miles in a pair of ultras and quickly realized it was the real deal shoe

shoe is great and has a lot of durability for the pull it has on the fashion world

They are great shoes i walk miles on campus everyday and they feel amazing They look great worn in the mall or the gym

it is like putting on snug slippers They feel great and run great I am surprised that they do not breath better but overall a solid running shoe

These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn They do fit a little tight but because of the knit material making it more of a sock feel I would recommend going a half size up for more room but overall these shoes are amazing and very stylish as well

This shoes is so comfortable I had to buy it in two colorways I recently bought some air max 15 prior to buying my first ultra boost in solar red The boost are way more comfortable to run in than the air max I recently picked up some ultra boost in a core black colorway when the website had my size available and I have to say the primeknit material feels a lot different than the primeknkt material on my solar reds I am not sure if I got a defective pair but other than that it is still a nice shoe They also look great so you can wear them with almost anything

These shoes are really good My feet do not hurt at all They are super comfy Very light on my feet I would definitely buy them again

Adidas has done a great job with this shoe It grips and fits my foot so I feel confident while running and looks great

You feel like you are walking in the clouds I use them to work since i have to be standing the whole day Really comfortable My husband has them in 5 different colors already He uses them to go to the gym

I only wore Asics Gel Nimbus forever but on a whim I purchased these shoes These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Hands down I typically run 3 5 miles 3 times a week it is a breeze in these shoes And they are super comfy for just walking around

Ultra Boost shoes fit like a glove and have been perfect for all workouts in the gym I have used my pair indoor for about six months and there is no sign of wear at all They grip perfectly on the slickest wood floor during weight training They fit like part of the body and perhaps the most important point is that they are not noticed while running on the treadmill it is as though they are part of you Hardly any weight Added bounce Best workout shoes ever

My son and I walked by a new Adidas shoe store in the mall and decided to go in He was looking for a new pair of running walking shoes and was trying some on the sales person was telling us about these new shoes Ultra Boost shoes and here exclusive Adidas soles and tops that are so comfortable it is like walking on air and they boost you while running My son was ready to leave but I tried the shoes on and convinced him to also We did not take them off and wore them home I am on my feet all day and I love these shoes Probably the best shoes I have ever owned PI was wearing a new pair of New Balance running shoes when we went into the store

I love the shoe Very comfortable and you can really feel the energy return Only draw back is that i feel my heel slipping out when doing my runs had to remove the insole for my foot to go deeper in the the shoe and for my heel not to slip out

This pair of shoes are insanely comfortable You can walk all day and feel no discomfort on your feet Definitely recommend this model

1 for Me

MOST COMFORTABLE SNEAKER EVER I just wish they had more black and white in stock

Very comfortable and good design

These by far are the best shoes i have ever owned great cushioning that allows me to be on my feet walking around all day for my job with ease

I own 5 pairs of Ultra Boosts are these shoes are extremely comfortable shoes whether they are used for running or everyday highly recommend these

This running shoe has to be one the most underrated running shoe A perfect mix of weight cushion and comfort

When I first put them on they felt a bit snug but they are designed to be that way I am a sz 11 5 12 depending on the sneaker and the 12 works fine for me They just mold to your foot after a few hours and I have not wanted to take them off my feet since I own at least 100 pairs of sneakers and these are in the top 3 as far as comfort and they look great

I am an avid runner and I am always in the gym In the streets of NYC or in the gym I can not say I have ever been more satisfied with a running shoe I use these sneakers for all my fitness activity energy return is great tie down is great

the prime knit upper is just so soft and formfitting and the boost midsole is so responsive yet plush the best running shoes ever 

Since experiencing the Energy boost adidas and the flyknit lunar 3 nike i have to say that the boost foam in this shoe feels much better in the Energy boost and the would Rose 5 I must say that the Boost provided a better energy return then the lunarlon in the flyknit lunar 3 I have to say that my favorite feature of the shoe is for sure the Primeknit Compared to the Flyknit it was pretty much the same They are both elastic form fitting uppers that did their job I must say that the lock down in the Ultra boosts was a little bit better because of the TPU heal counter for that heal lockdown what Nike did with the flynkit lunar 3 they made the flyknit tighter in the heal area and they have flywire too I gotta say that i like the Flyknit lunar 3 more as a runner just because of the low to the ground feel that the Lunarlon provides I would wear the Ultra Boosts casually more because they are FIRE Plus Kayne wore them

I wanted to wait 4 months before posting my review to understand the durability and all I can say is WOW I have put down very long mile runs and also interval training varying from 100m 800m pseudo sprints and these shoes are great Very comfortable and the comfort does not diminish in time

for the most part these look and feel awesome especially as a fashion shoe albeit a pricey one I wear them often for quick jaunts and everyday tasks The fit is true to size for me but it is definitely narrow but will break in with frequent use I do not recommend them for anything over 5k unless you are doing slower tempo runs Because of the bountiful boost and pronounced heel jaunt I had very acute ankle and knee pains when I tried to run at longer pace runs with these Went back to my Adistar Boosts and and that alleviated most of that pain

This shoe is brilliant Extremely comfortable and even more stylish I have trouble finding a good fit as I have a narrow 12 13 menshoe size The shoe does fit narrowly but in my case it is nothing short of perfect I got a 13 but a 12 5 my true size may have fit even more perfectly I have the triple white and it is beautiful and I get compliments and looks from friends and strangers alike Highly recommended Spend the extra 80 bucks and be happy and better than all your Nike wearing peers

Most comfortable shoes ever but go a half size up because they are a bit narrow Length wise they are fine though

Five Stars Best Running Shoes

its a really nice shoe but the only downside is the traction but that is it I know the 2 is they make it will be better as long as they fix the traction issue But I love them I prefer the pure boost for walking but the ultraboost for any work out

This shoe technology I would wonderful feels like your walking on the moon Only huge problem for wide foot people of the world Fitting a size 10 my size was like trying to fit The Big Show in a toy car

I can not complain about the shoequality comfort looks or anything else for that matter besides it is narrow fit I love the shoe but it does run vary narrow In my opinion

I really like the shoe I am already onto my second pair Only negative point I would have is that the nodes on the bottom of the sole tends to show wear quickly I have used other Adidas boost shoes and the soles did not show wear quickly so not sure what is going on with this shoe But like i said i am already into my second pair so not too big a problem for me

This shoe fits perfect and it feels as good on day 500 as it did on day 1 it is amazingly comfortable

It has a great feel with a breathable upper and the heel has enough support to feel great while running

I purchased these because of the good reviews of ultra boost cushioning I am a 6 2 200lb soccer player and need a cushioned ride for running These definitely fit the bill Primarily buy Adidas soccer shoes but love these for running No shin splints from any indoor outdoor runs yet No break in required Wore them a few hours around the house before my first run and no blisters ever Rare from my experience

I have been running for two years now and have not found a better shoe than this I run 10 miles a day in these on rock asphalt track and sand Perfect for wherever you run My dad has 10 pairs of these He has been running for 40 years and has only missed 24 days of running since then He also says that these are the best shoes he has ever run in They hold up to the 16 miles he puts on them everyday We will never buy anything but adidas boost again

I love the feel of these shoes but the Adidas line runs very narrow and has become more so I am a female and have to buy from the menline because the womenseries it way too narrow for my foot I was extremley happy with the Boost 6 series but the 7s are narrower and less comfortable I hope Adidas will work on this aspect because they make a superior shoe but the width leaves out a significant portion of the running population When a woman who can normally wear a wide shoe from virtually any running shoe company feels stifled by a menregular size there is a problem Adidas please offer better widths

I have been forcing myself to become a runner I hate it Until I tried these shoes The are very responsive and absorb a lot of impact For the first time in my life my feet were not the first part of my body to fatigue they are the last The do wrap your entire foot and that took a bit getting use to Thanks to them my training has greatly improved

Amazing shoe I love the feel and comfortability

The Ultra Boost is easily the best overall shoe in the market Easily more comfortable and cushioned than Lunarlon Micro etc The Ultra Boost has a perfect mix of firmness but responsiveness You are not sinking into the shoe but it is very bouncy The Primeknit material is also much more form fitting than Flyknit I will buy more pairs in the future

I bought a pair of these pre release and was very pleased when they arrived I own 3 other Adidas boost series shoes Theses Ultra Boost look very nice and are very light The major flaw that I see with them is that they are not a true fit They fit very tightly especially around the areas of the arch of the feet It has a form fitting inner section which is very tight with no adjustments possible To say the least I am very disappointed after spending so much money on a pair of shoes that do not fit

I have worn 12for a long time and I have only had to size down to an 11 or 11 5 maybe once or twice This is the first shoe I have gotten that I will need to half size up to 12 5 My foot fits in it fine length wise but the shoe is very narrow around the toes at least for me making the shoe too tight around the toes

I have put 18 miles on these shoes Six 3 miles runs 2 on treadmills and 4 outside I am very impressed with the shock absorption so far hope they stay this way for a long time The upper is fantastic Super comfortable with good room in the toe box My previous shoes Boost ESM really hurt the top of my feet due to a poorly constructed tongue have not done any speed work yet on these but am looking forward to it I must say that these do tend to run a little long I normally get a 10 5 US but these definitely run alittle long Width is spot on I will up the mileage on these in time I have had 5 knee surgeries on left knee and shock absortion is of paramount importance to me I must say that it is a real pleasure to run in a shoe that absorbs shock without feeling like a marshmallow It is awesome on my aging knees A suggestion though The removable sockliner really needs a more pronounced arch i wil replace the the ones that came with these when I do longer runs Overall really pleased Maybe drop the price a tad but Great job Adidas

I love the Boost series I have bought many pairs and no longer even consider another brand Everything I could ask for in a shoe

These have been my most expensive pair of running shoes I have bought to date I have two pairs of Boston Boosts and Supernova Glide 7 and decided to try these out alongside They fit very comfortably have excellent grip on pavement and are good for walking light running

Most comfortable runners i have At first wear they are a little tight but once you loosen the laces and wear them for a little bit they are super comfy Awesome kicks

I love these shoes like them as soon as I tried them on Best energy return and the comfort WOW Just do not last the sole is what needs to be addressed before I buy another pair I have recommend to a few friends but with a disclaimer

After owning the Pure Boost I could not wait to wear these Ultra Boost Super comfortable and more stable than the Pure Boost better for running I will be curious how well the fabric mesh material holds up Would definitely recommend

Love the shoe Wish they offered in a wide fit

Adidas has a winner here Excellent balance of softness and responsiveness Very comfortable

The Yeezy Affect

Order 1 2 size larger for more comfort wear

This is my 3rd pair of Ultra Boost I just wanted different colors I love the seamless design and added cushion in these I have been using the Ultra Boost for regular training days as well as long runs and so far they have not let me down My only comment would be to make a thicker rubber sole maybe use the Continental rubber like the Supernova

REALLY NICE SHOE FITS REALLY WELL PERFECT FUR RUNNING HOLDS YOUR FOOT REALLY NICE AND TIGHT

It is one of the best shoes if not the best shoe I have ever purchased It is a really unique feel The upper does not have any structureit what so ever The only thing holding your foot in place is the heel counter and the three stripes soft synthetic that are located on the midfoot Despite the minimal structure they hold your foot securely in place impresivelly well They might feel a little bit unconfortable for the first few hours of wearing time but after some time you will get used to the new feel and the primeknit upper will mold to fit your foot After your first twothree days of wearing there will be no extra space between the upper and your foot

This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing and comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life This shoe is fashion forward and is worn by many of the biggest celebreties such as Kanye West The fit is nice and snug and when you walk it feels like a cloud The primeknit technology is very advanced and the intriquite weaving of the shoe is a work of art Minimal branding on the shoe because the superior design speaks for itself This is a great casual shoe to add to your daily rotation

Base LineYou will never ever regret this purchase and i am sure you will miss them if you are not wearing yours

When I bought the Pure Boost a year or so ago I was pretty disappointed I wanted to like them but they were just so narrow Also they were comfortable but not very stable I was rolling my ankles all day

The Ultra Boost are extremely comfortable it is like walking on rubber clouds The Primeknit is stretchy and comfortable The shoe does fit narrow as I had to size 5 up even wearing extremely thin socks

Any shoe that feels this amazing has to be bad for you Thank god Adidas does not make food

It is not an understatement to say these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Bouncy but not too much with a perfect stretch fit with the durable Primeknit and extremely breathable fabric The souls are grippy rubber and durable These are perfect urban running and street shoes On point styling

it is the greatest running shoes ever made What I like about this shoes is the combination of primeknit and boost technology that best compliment each other You will never get wrong with that combination but others say the price is a little bit pricey compared to other running shoes The price does not matter if you can have the best of both worlds First it is the most comfortable shoes for running second it is very versatile because you can be very stylish and trendy while wearing this shoes I am looking forward for more ultra boost colorways and boost products

I do not know how someone wouldnt like this shoe Its comfortable stylish and lightweight Its been my go to travel shoe and its easy to wear since it goes with almost everything Definetly recommend giving it a try

I wanted to like these shoes I really did For starters i think the boost cushioning is absolutely amazing probably the best cushioning out in the market The prime knit is also very lightweight and breathable What really hold this shoe back from being amazing is the lacing system and the upper in general There is no end hole to secure a tight fit which almost every running shoe out there has The fatal flaw of these shoes is the lacing system It uses hard plastic on the sides to reinforce the shoe which is a god awful idea When laced up the hard plastic hugs the side of your feet to death and allow literally no room for your foot to expand This leads to extreme amounts of pain in the side of the feet I cant loosen up the laces without losing a barely snug fit These shoes are also very narrow I bumped up a full size and my wide feet were still bulging out The cushioning is great but the lacing system just makes these shoes unwearable

These shoes are really comfortable I love everything except the outsole The outsole wears out quickly It also makes the shoes slippery on wet surface

Love the shoe overall however the sole is poorly made first it sounds like youre wearing spikes when walking around on indoor surfaces second when the surface is wet there is absolutely no traction i was planning on going for a jog in my neighborhood after it rained and ended up slipping multiple times on concrete surfaces i definitely hope that the UB 2 0 gets a sole upgrade

let us get straight to the point I fell for the hype let us break it down

I mean Kanye wore them Does anything else need to be said These are the Goat of shoes behind actually yeezys

I do a minimum of three miles a day and do a max of miles These shoe have been great for it and really comfortable

Quality is horrible Would not buy another Adidas product especially this one How can a running shoes have its sole worn out within a monthThis is outrageous

Interesting show and very versatile everyday running and trainer

I find the Adidas Energy Boost line to offer the most support of any running shoe out there The Ultra Boost provides the same support and cushion but with a lighter signature that not only makes for greater comfort for training but also for casual wear as well

I like the appearance fit and quality of workmanship I do feel some energy return after each stride but I want more My feet are size 11 1 2 but I weigh only 155 so the shoe foundation is too stiff for my low weight When I jump up six inches and land flat footed on a concrete floor I do feel a rebound but not enough to lift the sole off the ground My runs are good but not significantly better than with my other running shoes and therefore the higher cost is a drawback The shoes are very comfortable for both walking and running and I did not have any problems with them after several runs

The prime knit upper gives a one to one fit on your foot that cant be matched by any other shoe and boost is still the best cushioning set up ive ever felt It does not hurt that they look great too

One of the best shoes I have found in a long time Super comfortable Looking into buying another pair

Adidas always fit true to size These were no different feels great with a very neutral feel Well cushioned and seems to propel you forward as you roll off your foot Function feel wise I have no complaints However they look like those custom made orthopedic shoes when you have them on They have an odd shape especially the back that sticks out past the heel makes you look like a grandpa wearing comfort ortho shoes They look great in pics but on the foot it is a different story Just too big and clunky looking Too bad

Shoes were good except that the plastic stripes on the side bruised my foot Would prefer cloth stripes in a shoe that is built out of a comfortable well fitting knit Had to send back as I could not wear due to pain because of the plastic stripes Would recommend these if the stripes do not bother your feet as they are soft and fit well Please get rid of plastic stripes

It feels like your walking on clouds

I purchased these shoes for exercise purposes but i am by no means a runner But I do have bad knees from playing football in the past and still enjoy exercising I never thought that a shoe could be a solution for my knees during squats lunges jumps etc but I can say with confidence if your in a similar position as myself and are looking for a COMFORTABLE shoe for daily weight training This is the model for you Side note however I have only owned these for 1 week I am curious to see durability I hear a lot of horror stories

have not been wearing them long but so far very comfortable light and easiest on the knees that i have ever tried I have knee problems will need knee replacement in the next few years but these will help me to put it off longer

THIS IS THE BEST

This is my second pair of the Ultra Boosts I previously bought the black ones and fell in love I am not much of a runner but I do walk a ton at my job Whether it is running or walking you will not want to take them off

I purchased these shoes knowing that I would not be running 10to 100of miles them I purchased them because I needed a great gym shoe with good stability and extreme comfort along with responsiveness so I do not feel like I am dragging my feet through molasses This shoe is the most fantastic shoe I have ever owned This shoe actually makes me want to go on longer runs The Boost Foam is not a gimmick it is an amazing midsole that outperforms anything else I have ever run in based on responsiveness and because it is uber comfortable The upper the adidas Primeknit is also a major reason why this shoe is so comfortable and breathable It stretches and flexes and does anything you want but will always go back to its beginning position The shoe is a bootie type shoe fit which adds to its crazy comfort It feels like wearing an awesome sock The Stretchweb outsole is also great It has held up great so far with minimal wear The only downside to this shoe is the super high price tag but it is pretty reasonable when you look at what really went into the research and development of this shoe I love it

Being a owner of the original Energy Boosts and Energy Boosts 2 ESM model shoes the Ultra Boosts are a dramatic upgrade from it is predecessors First off the mesh uppers are breathable snug and supportive without being as tight in the toe box area as the original Energy Boosts In other words the Ultra Boosts are true to size

I really like this pair of shoes I had one but I would like to buy for my friend but i already go back Taiwan Could you help to assist sent to TaiwanBut free shipping valid on domestic Uorders only so if have to send to Taiwan how much should i pay

Just got a pair of the Ultras and overall they are very nice looking in person The knit material is more robust than I expected but has some stretch to it It is woven to allow little openings so you can actually see through it a bit The heel material is also more stiff than expected

I have had the shoe for about a month I really want to love this shoe but it is just to narrow Blister on my little toe with no relief with thin socks or band aids To late to return I guess I wear a medium width shoe in all other brands

Best shoe ever

I am a big fan and I love the Boost Collection I own 3 pairs 2 Energies Boston Boost These by far are the best shoes right now They are sleek comfortable light and def ultra cushiony it is like walking on bouncy clouds

Absolutely the most comfortable shoes for me EVER My feet smile whenever I put these on and run I loved my Energy Boost 2 but these are a whole order of magnitude more comfy

One wordHeavenly Wow I know 2 words could not help it Most comfortable runner I have ever worn Out of box slipped in my foot beds busted out an enthusiastic 4mi and now I do not want to take them off

Its look like comfortable from the fist wear but after a while you will start to feel how narrow it is and you will got the pain after that

I have been a runner for 15 years and prior to this did not run in Adidas I met with the Adidas rep at my running store in Boulder CO and agreed to give these a chance I was and continue to be very impressed This are amazing runners and I can feel the boost material spring back on every step I was able to run on snow ice trails and obviously pavement I plan on picking up other colorways and these will probably become my default runners

Received in the mail today after ordering from the adidas website Just finished my first run 4 5 miles The shoes fit my foot better than the Boost and I think I will be a fan of the tongeless you Boost Definitely a sock like fit During the run my toes got really numb I am attributing part of that to the fact that they are fresh out of the box and I need to break them in a bit throughout the course of several runs So I will have to report back after a week or so

At first the price tag almost made me skip this inaugural launchbut with all the awesome reviews coming in I had to jump in And I have not regretted it since Best Boost and runners I have ever purchased I even started to wear this daily for work where I am traveling on my feet a lot The only criticism I have is regarding the nubs on the soles As some folks have already pointed out they do wear out faster than one would think I was a little suprised with this especially after hearing that this Stretchweb layer is basically the same material as rubber tires so they should last for some time But that is not what I am noticing I hope Adidas fixes this on version 2 0 Otherwise this is a killer runner Oh and LOVE the Primeknit Boost combo and to have it available for the general public unlike the initial ultra limited ultra difficult to purchase Primeknits

I also wish Adidas would make the boost foam in colors other than white as it is hard to keep clean Give them a try you will love them

Extremely comfortable shoe and I love the knit material It fits so well on your foot 2 downsides though I feel like there is not enough support on the shoe I have flat feet so I need an extremely supportive shoe and I have noticed after about 3 weeks some stitching has come out Overall great shoe and great looking shoe

In the words of the Lego MovieEverything is AWESOME

Purchased the shoes during the general release and did a 6 mi and 20 mi city run in them at an8min mi pace I can not lie they are comfy and felt nice but after my run I noticed EXCESSIVE wear on the soles in comparison to a pair of the Glide Boosts The pavement shredded the black treads For a product at this premium price point I would hope they last long enough to train and RUN THE ACTUAL RACE YOU are TRAINING FOR At this rate the soles will be bald in a month

I have been waiting for this shoe for weeks read all the reviews and hype videos and they finally show up I do not think I could be more disappointed in a shoe than I am right now I think all the hype over this shoe plays a big role in my disappointment

I purchased the ultra boost as I was curious about how they would hold up in a run I run about 20 miles a week I wore the shoe all day to kinds get used to wearing them and then wore them on my morning run the next day Took about 3 miles to get used to running with them on They were comfortable but not the most comfortable I suppose I currently love running in minimalist so the added comfort kinda bothered me Super comfy shoe to wear by far

could not be happier with these Very comfortable just the right amount of cushion

Fantastic shoe in so many regards Fit well comfortable great cushioning But I agree with other reviews here that the wear is through the roof it is nice and grippy but compared to the continental sole on my normal boosts these just evaporate Whereas I would normally get 2 months out of a pair I have had these a week and they are just about toast already This does need addressing The only fault though this aside they are remarkable

Ultra nice shoe Runs very large Boost is very comfty More colors please

The Boost continues to improve as it is the most comfortable shoe ever

Much better forefront cushioning than previous generations of the boost lineup They feel as consistent for indoor runs as they do for cold outdoor weather runs If your looking for a soft neutral ride get the ultra boost

This is one of the most comfortable running shoes I have run in My only concern is the durability of the stretchweb outsole After less than 10 miles many of the tread bumps are almost worn off Within the next 2 weeks I will monitor this carefully and determine whether or not I need to return them per the 30 day return policy

First this shoe is amazing Im an ex collegiate and athlete with a neutral gate and forefoot midfoot runner I am approx 200lbs and need a cushioned ride I have been looking forever for a shoe with enough fore mid foot cushioning for the heavier neutral runner and I feel as though everything is focused on Heel cushioning these days but this is amazing for the mid forefoot striker Extremely cushioned and soft yet responsive feels great on the foot needed two days to break the shoe in and no injuries since I have had them You do not want to take these babies off believe the hype I almost missed out on a great shoe

Most comfortable shoes I have ever had

This shoe feels great when I run They feel so comfortable and make my run fun

I like the way this shoe fits because I do not experience heel slip like I do in other shoes However I did find it seemed I was using more effort in my runs with these shoes compared to my Supernova Glide 7s

I want to start with the fit since that was what I was most concerned with before I bought them Every athletic adidas shoe I have ever bought has been too narrow and I usually buy a half size up or a full size up I bought these in a half size up and it fits fine I am interested to know what a full size up feels like but I must admit these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn Great for running If I could afford it I would buy ten pairs

Adidas has done it again What a winning formula other brands need to take notes Me feet and I thank you

I have been wearing the boost shoes ever since I tried them on in the store and felt like I found the magic slipper These are expensive shoes but feel my feet are worth it This new model is a bit harder to slip on my foot but then again having a tongue that does not move has its advantages we well Now I only wish there were more colors

The most amazing running shoes ever It is exquisite I could actually run more with it More workout time I loooooooove it Looks good And plus it is worn by the biggest stars in sports

I have had two pair of Boost prior to these which I really loved However when I slipped these on I could instantly tell that they were a lot more comfortable I love running in these They have the spring that the Boost are known for but with extreme comfort Love them

I have been running in Boost for several years now The new Ultra is superior in every way The original Boost was to narrow The fit is excellent and I have shaved time off of my runs I am training for the Boston Marathon now and just purchased a second pair for the event

I am a Special Operations Solider and a routine weight lifter This shoes makes me feel a least 10 lbs lighter awesome shoe for a heavier runner

I am buying another pair when there are more color choices

I have been a big fan of the boost line since it arrived on the market and the Ultra Boost are no exception At first when I tried them on I thought they were too small but once you start running in them they contour to your foot It does take some getting used too but the break in time is very quick They do run true to size I did not have to order a larger size like I had too with the original Boost or Boost 2 0 I did find the Ultra Boost less clunky feeling I am a heel striker and the transition from heel strike through the gait cycle to toe off was super smooth The fit is really nice It is snug but allows more flex than the original Boost or Boost 2 0 I noticed a great improvement in the traction The Boost return on these are incredible As I became tired on a long run the return energy really helped a lot and I found my self not having to struggle as much as I became more tired as my run went on There is a definite improvement in the cushioning It is a softer ride like the Supernova Boost 7 and Response Boost but it is not squishy or too firm Seems like they nailed it just right Are these the best running shoe ever that is up for you to decide what I can say is that the Ultra Boost is going to be very difficult for the competition to beat I read in some other reviews that the heel was not comfortable I did not encounter any discomfort at all I will be using these for my regular trainers and for an up coming 3K run The materials have a nice sturdy feel to them I only have a few nit pick negatives The laces are thin in width I wish they were wider like the Supernova Boost 7 how ever it did not hinder performance at all Next is the steep price It would have been nice if there was a more friendly price tag on the Ultra Boost or maybe include a free Boostshirt or carry bag

These shoes were bought for my grandson He selected them because he has owned a few pairs of Jordan low and high tops before He absolutely loves these He said they were quite comfortable and felt great on his feet He wears them every day to school Great shoes Highly recommend them

Very comfortable definitely will buy another pair and get my friends to buy to

I purchase these shoes for my son who is just starting middle School I purchased an 8 men in these Jordan Jumpman shoes First day of school Im walking with him to the bus stop he is walking like FRANKENSTEIN Second day the same thing my son gets ready for school but FRANKENSTEIN walks out He finally tells me that they are uncomfortable they hurt the bottom of his feet I removed the insole and replaced it with a foam sole I purchase from Walmart That fixed the problem

The jordan has a nice color but they feel little blisted after taking them off they feel nice when you put them on and walk around in them thats why i bought them a size bigger love my new js

Perfect for everyday and exercise and they look great

I like the color quality nice design and it is very comfortable to wear

This shoe is stylish for both casual and at work They are extremely comfortable

These Jordanare the absolute best I bought them for my son to wear to school and man mmmmmmm These kicks are something to brag about They are comfortable for work and play

Good shoes comfortable i see alot of people with the different style of shoe

do not get me wrong I Luv My Jbut I put my shoestrings inside my shoes and when I am on chill mode they have a slight discomfort where I wanna just take them off But they are Super fresh on the street and get made likes from the crowd

So stylish and comfortable I could wear them all day

Goodall product Fair price and good delivery service

I had these kicks when I was in middle school and the fact that I am able to get them again was crazy Most of my kick that I have been purchasing have been throwbacks from my childhood and I am glad that I can check these ones off

This is a classic Jumpman shoe and a great investment Very comfortable durable and stylish

Great deal for a birthday gift and awesome style and feel I would totally get another pair

Despite the flaws below great shoe and will definitely get another pair

Shoes have a great look overall and definitely standout On the new cushing technology is very hard to feel its responsiveness Would also recommend Under Armour to due away with the poke a dotted shoelaces I would give the shoe overall a rating of 8 out of 10

Ive got three pairs Actually using Sonics to run in right now but once worn down Ill switch to these Great for style right now Soon to be running shoe

I love the UA brand and its apparel But I am very disappointed with the size and availability of your shoes

Great shoe Awesome color I generally wear a size 6 to 6 5 in menIt may be the style in this shoe I wear a mensize 8

and this shoes are not good for running love the shoes for walking but they are not for run

Please continue to make this version of this model The ankle collar on the SE version is too firm and causes a lot of discomfort I know several people have said the said the same about the traditional version but that is from people who do not wear socks The original version is perfect do not phase it out Plantar fasciitis disappears with this shoe

This is my first pair and they run a little smaller than I expected however still comfortable I wanted the shoe to accurately track my workouts running walking on treadmill and outside The technology is great Works great with my iPhone whether I have it with me or not the sync process is great I love the shoe i purchased the Red Phantoms and now I want a pair Black will purchase again soon

I had high hopes for this running shoe Since the Gemini was retired I was looking for a UA replacement Well this is NOT it

I am flat footed so I have been searching for a cushioned type sneaker So my daughter suggested I give these a try I am happy to say the Phantom Connected is a very comfortable shoe I walk more than jog for at least 3 miles on the tar lined streets in my neighborhood since my knees have become quite sensitive and worn from past constant jogging on hard surfaces While wearing these shoes they protected my very well by absorbing the shock from the hard pavement and feeling very lite at the same time I have tried the other best selling brands and I have to say these shoes are up there with the best They do run a little small IMO so I would recommend going up a half size I wear a size 12 but ordered a 12 5 which fits perfect I like the styling and can wear these as a daily casual shoe

I have been wearing the Sonic for about a year my favorite UA shoe by far I held off on the Phantom over concern about the ankle liner rubbing my skin because I wear no show socks I am a sucker for red shoes so when the colorway was are released I decided to try and hope for the best The ankle liner just covers my tab socks and did rub my skin red front and back on a 2 mile run Otherwise the shoe is as comfortable and good looking as advertised I did read a professional review that noted after sizing up 1 2 size his ankle issue went away However I ordered my regular UA shoe size and the shoe fits well If you wear a thin sock I would describe this shoe as true to size If you wear a cushioned sock i would go up 1 2 size for sure I can see why so many people say order up but I think this is all about what kind of sock you are wearing Long story short I plan to keep them but i am sticking with the Sonic on run days

This is my 2nd pair of these I have the all charcoal color and when I saw the all red I KNEW I had to have them I wear a women size 10 or a men size 8 5 I have to order up a half size in these men 9 to fit as they are cut very small But they make my feet look small and cute I could have probably went to a 9 5 men but I like my shoes to be snug at first and after wearing a few times they are good to go 1 CON about these is they have NO traction on wet surfaces it is so strange but you will slip if you are not extremely careful on anything that is wet other then that these are my all time fav workout shoes at the gym I do body pump and boot c and classes and lift and these are amazing Then I go straight to my cardio with these I never miss a beat Please make a ALL HOT PINK COLOR in these UA

This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever owned As a former marathoner who decided to go back to jogging after 40 years I am amazed at the advances in running shoes since I ran Boston in 1981 The only thing I would change about the shoe is to put another loop on the back of the shoe to make putting the shoe on easier I would also use a more pliable shoe lace since I have had to double knot the shoe to prevent the shoe from untying during a run

Perfect fit great comfort overall awesome shoes

One month ago I bought HOVR Phantom Connected shoes from you and I am not happy with them first of all the connected service does not work properly it takes too many miles second shoes are very slippery on wet roads thirdly when running on longer distances a lot of energy is felt and I feel strong spine pain for the fourth week I used to run in these shoes Nyc Marathon end I had strong painful fingers in the foot after 3 days 2 nails have turned black despite the size of the shoes is good these walking shoes are very comfortable while running do not fit in This is my opinion

Great ankle support and comfort Highly recommend it for running

VerdictI would return the shoes if I could

I had knee issues over the past few years and running was no longer fun These shoes really helped to take stress off of my knees and they got ALOT better in a month With improved knees I could run again and lost weight which made my knees almost pain free Thank you UA

Right size and comfort I love this shoes for training

FIRE

I purchased this shoe for my 12 year old son He says they are very comfortable and light The shoe ran small so we had to go up a 1 2 size I have also noticed they are a little challenging for him to put on due to the sock like fit

I purchased these a month or so ago This is my first Under Armour sneaker purchase I have several different boots from Under Armour that I love These sneakers were no different The fit and comfort is great They are super lightweight which was an added bonus The material feels good and it makes them breathable I would definitely purchase these again

Extremely comfortable and true to size 8 5 I wear these daily while weight training Fashionable and functional UA a fan all the way Keep up the good work UA

My shoes have worked out well for me They fit well very comfortable and perform well I wear these shoes 6 days a week for my workouts I run 3 5 miles and work with weights on my workout days The shoes have out performed any other shoe I have owned

It runs large and the comfort was amazing I liked how the shoes was light as a feather

The HOVR Phantom has a smart design that is made with a wax based foam for better energy flow softness and adaptability

The shoes are cut a lil small and these fit very snug I have only worn them once and have since bought a pair an half size larger

Best pair of running shoes I have ever bought looking forward to getting a few more

The shoe looks great but unfortunately it just does not fit me right I love the UA brand but this shoe is not for me

These are the absolute best running shoes i have worn in my life Its really feels like you are walking on clouds honestly Please Under Armour give me more color options i would use these as a casual sneaker given the chance A small tip i would give is to wear above ankle socks the top part of the sneaker rubs on the skin and irritates it But this is a minor grievance compared to how awesome these sneakers are Also the fact that it logs my workouts or just how many steps i took is pretty cool I tend to open the app just to see how much i walked that is awesome

Super comfy size is normal the only complaint i have is with the UARun app and the elastic texture at the top of the shoe The app would crash and not record my runs so I just stopped using it should have just gotten the regular version of the shoes since I do not use that feature And the top of the shoe rubs the skin so you cant wear low cut socks other than that loved them

This is a great shoe better than the ultra boost shoe from adidas Would highly recommend

Gave as a gift and he absolutely loved them The app is super cool and works effortlessly He was beyond impressed with the comfort and feel overall recommended

Love my Hovr I actually have 3 pairs in different colors and they all are great fits super comforatble and lightweight Whether I am using them to weight train or run these are versatile shoes I like the connected especially because linked with the App it will tell me my stride length cadence splits pace etc All great information to help me train and run better and more efficiently

The shoe is really comfortable for running purposes It has a fitted type of fill The opening is a bit awkward to put the shoe on It has a compression sleeve around the ankle which can be annoying depending on the type of sock you wear I generally wear low cut sock so it does not bother me Overall a great shoe and fits the purpose I bought it for

The shoe fits as expected Great support lightweight Great show for jogging running working out I work out 3 to 5 times per week and I have trouble finding a good shoe that is lightweight yet supports during a pounding work out This shoe met my expectations it performs well and I would recommend it

Great shoes really comfortable will defiantly buy more colors

If you are thinking about purchasing this sneaker and do not pull the trigger you do so at your own detrimentyou will not find a more comfortable supportive breathable piece of footwear

or a well made tongue

Shoes run small ordered sixe 12 same as my Brooks Did not like the collar hard to put shoes on Lacked good arch support Shoes did not give a good feeling of being stable Over all very let down for the price and had trouble getting shoes to connect to the UA app Only positive is the shoes were light

These shoes are fantastic I have been running for over 15 years and I have ran all types of distances from 5ks to full marathons These are the best shoes that I have ever purchased The toe box in the shoes is great The design of the shoetoe box is such that the constant pounding from running longer distances your toes have enough room to expandThe sole rolls great with your stride and the cushioning is great I have not had a problem with the app syncing with my shoes and the feedback it provides is insightful and allows you to make small adjustments for large gains while running The only slightly negative thing that can be said about these shoes is the break in period is a little weird with them The overall fit is great and I love the way the shoes hug my feet These shoes are great and I highly recommend them for anyone needing new running shoes

Much like the Gemini 2s the HOVR Phantoms have that kind of feel that Wows you as soon as you try them on They look great feel fantastic and have a level of support that is not matched any other UA shoe I was on the fence about them when they launched but I absolutely love them now

being 6 4 320 i can say these have been the most comfortable shoes ive worn in a very long time ive already purchased 3 pairs of size 15 white gray and black one for training and lifting other for just everyday walking and comfort I am very satisfied with these HOVR PHANTHOMS

I should have bought these shoes a long time ago but could not because they were always out of stock Finally got a pair and I could not be happier with them My job requires me to be on my feet all day and these shoes are very comfortable to wear on those 8 hour shifts Even standing around they feel good on my feet The sock fit is nice some people do not really care for it but it is something to get use to I know people do not want to spend a lot of money on shoes but I would recommend these shoes to anyone who works long days on their feet

Honestly the best shoes I have ever purchased I mostly use them for casual purposes as they just look so nice and it is like your walking on clouds I have done a few runs with them with 0 break in required and again my feet feel amazing Everyone keeps asking me about them tons of compliments and I point them to right here Underarmour your UA Hovr shoes are simply put 20 10 To all potential buyers do not even second guess it give it a try and I know you will love them as I do My shoes size is 9 and a 9 fits perfectly I did not need to get a half size larger as was recommended

I hope it helps those trying to make a decision on buying a pair When in doubt always try a pair at retail outlet

These are by far the best shoes I have ever owned Very comfortable and great look can not wait for more colors

The most painful shoe I have ever worn I am a personal fitness trainer and thus far have absolutely loved every pair of UA shoes I have owned until these By the time I got to my office on the first day wearing them my left foot was hurting so bad that I had to take them off So I was a bit embarrassed when I had to work with my first two clients bare footed

Extremely comfortable and great cushion to walk or run in

super comfy no doubt but what kind od running shoes do not give you any kind if grip on wet condition DO NOT RUN WHEN ITS WET will be best shoes if its not sleepery and gives some grip

Inside my feet were rubbing the edges of the liner and it was uncomfortable I know from running experience 30 40 miles a week this was going to be a major blister issue as the miles rack up I normally wear an 11 5 12 but ordered these in a 12 5 They were still a little short I am wearing a 12 in the Sonic

Thanks to UA for coming up with this shoes do not discontinue them do not try to improve them they are just fine the way they are Maybe try to add a little slip resistant material on the out sole but other than that they are great

I bought these shoes 5 days after their lunch and i still wear them till this day and all i gotta say is that Under Armour nailed it right on the dot for comfort I use shoes mostly for the gym and when i go running but i cant help the comfort on theses shoes that i wear them everyday when i go out The fit on shoe is little big maybe go up half a size the fit for wide footed people including my self is amazing The one issue i do have is that it does not have a pull tap on the back heel which i hope they can fix but other than that this shoes is the best

I currently own a pair of Phantoms and Sonics and have to say that these are incredibly comfortable I also have flat feet but these do not seem to bother me So I plan on purchasing a couple additional pairs but they keep selling out in my size

Overall the shoe is great 1 complaint needs a better rubber for the soles I would like to see Michelin rubber for the sole since I have seen other UA shoes with Michelin soles

Who am IJust a 41yr old father husband 1st responder and a runner 5 7 155 ish 3 weeks ago I got the Sonics size 9 5 Under Armour has outdone any previous shoe they have built with the Hovr I am extremely picky about shoes I like them light breathable fast but with cushion it is a hard combo to satisfy really Hovr hit the mark For me personally I would take a tad more cushion but in reality I do not want Under Armour to mess with this shoe I have put in 50 miles at a high 6min pace to an 8min pace and they have exceeded my expectations

The only thing this shoe needs is an insert I added an insert from my hovr sonic and its all it needed BEST SHOE EVER and I mean EVER You name a running shoe I have tried it I used to do reviews for runners magazines and I now started doing YouTube reviews with these HOVR shoes You Tube my name and hovr You will find them

I ordered the black Keep in mind I only wore indoors so I could return with ease Prosthey look nice ConsLack of support in 2 ways 1 The upper is not supportive so my foot would slide towards the toe 2 Not much arch support which does not work for me which puts more pressure on other areas of the foot I had hoped they were gonna work for me because I am very active walking mostly 2x daily and run a little

Really as great a training shoe as you will find Only issue is it runs nearly a half to a full size too small I wear an 11 5 and even a 12 is a little snug Great quality though and hopefully more colorways surface with matching soles White gets dirty way too fast

DislikeI wish you had this all in black with gold UA logo I would buy it again and thousand of people with my design

I now have two pairs of HOVR Phantom white and black and HOVR Sonic blue The all red HOVR Phantom will complete my set Onto the functionality of these shoes it is not an over exaggeration to say they shoes are like walking on air I typically wear my Phantoms during cross training or relaxing in other words when I am working hard as well as hardly working I would recommend these shoes on the basis of performance and foot support and relaxing outside of training

By far the best pair of trainers that I have ever worn True Fit size of 10 5 worked perfectly for me I usually wear a 9 5 10 but with my wide feet the 10 5s were perfect Most kicks that I have worn wide width or not do not provide the side support cushioning that the Phantoms provide I have not messed about with UARecord Sensor tech yet so I can not comment on that The sock top takes a little getting use to when putting on the shoe but it does make for a snug feeling fit

I am an avid runner about 3 times a week but I have never liked Under Armour shoes until now The Phantom competes with top cushioned brands and is cheaper in cost compared to them but matches or outperforms them I rotate between three to four pairs of shoes so this will not be my only shoe but it will be in my rotation from now on and if you only use one pair of running shoes at a time like most people than you will not be disappointed in these I found that they are true to size however they are snug because of the sock like feel so if you like a loose shoe then I would recommend a half size up

Great shoes Order half a size up They run tight at the toe I went by the True Size guide and it was wrong Have other UA pairs and they are true to size These are tight I would exchange but they are out of stock Grrrrrgh Otherwise a wonderful pair of shoes Just a bit tight

I love it My knee is feeling so much better after a run Thank you for making this shoes Feels amazing and looks good I wear it to work with my suits and it looks good

from the moment i put them on i feel in love with them they are hands down the they most comfortable shoe i have worn in a long time

I normally wear around a size 10 and ordered 10 5 Fit too snug so those went back Got the size 11 and they fit perfectly Had my first workout with them and they are lightweight cushy and very comfortable to wear I like the sock style top rather than a shoe tongue The tracking worked well although I am not sure the distance recorded was accurate Wearing an Apple Watch measures quite differently Would give these shoes two thumbs up

Bought the new HOVR Phantom and it is awesome Comfortable and looks great If a serious runner long runs the sonic is most probably a better ride but the upper on the phantom for lower intensity and casual wear is like a luxury car

Fit was perfect 9 5 Comfort and performance were great No pain while running or afterwards Already looking to buy another pair

Best pair of shoes yet UA seems to be making progress with shoe design Hopefully this is just a start of what is to come in the future

Comfort in the footbed is outstanding for this large framed runner at 6 4 and 245 lbs The connected features are excellent and I love the voice feedback it is also a great added value that UA has thrown in a year MVP membership on MMR purchase

Been waiting for these shoes to come out for awhile They did not disappoint Great feel style and fit You will not regret buying them that is for sure

Finally a super stylish super comfortable pair of running shoes Double thumbs up

Let me start off by saying that I have been exclusively buying UA shoes for the past 6 7 years and these Phantoms are by far the most comfortable pair to date They are incredibly soft and very comfortable on my feet I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis so it was difficult finding a pair that offers great support until now First time running in these and I did not want to limp afterwards They do run a little small I recomend going a half size up to ensure MAXIMUM comfort but be careful that there is not too room that you start slipping I got the all red pair I see they are already sold out and I am happy I chose that colorI am a sucker for all red shoes Another plus to these is that they can connect to the app so I will be able to track my runs efficiently I would buy more pairs if they offered more mono colored styles like the all red and all white but for now it is just a dream Definitely worth the buy I will have to see how these bad boys fend off after a month or two but for now Great job to the brilliant minds at UA for these amazing shoes I like to name all of my shoes and these easily deserve the name Red Bottom es

I have a ton of feet issues including Tarsal Tunnel and Plantar Fasciitis I had nerve surgery last April having not been able to run comfortably in over two years I have tried many UA shoes and other brands but nothing has worked I bought a pair of Phantoms and could not be happier These shoes are so comfortable and perform amazingly I just ran on the treadmill comfortably for the first time in years Will be buying several other pairs They do run a bit small as most of these knit shoes do but sometimes it takes a week or two to break in that toe box Absolutely recommend these shoes as running shoes or the everyday lifestyle pair

But would be better to have mono black ver

I use these for working out as well as for casual wear They really are incredibly comfortable on day one I usually need a week or two for shoes to break in because my feet are slightly wider than the shoes I typically get But these flexed to conform perfectly to my foot on day one Great shoe

First time I put my feet into them they felt so comfortable Then I went for a run and it felt like I was floating above the ground Excited to go out and run now because of these shoes

The AJ 33 is a signature shoes that comes from a long line of great footwear The quality and texture of the shoes is second to none Compared to the previous AJ 32 this shoe is tighter overall fit from heel to toe Yet the lightness of the shoe is about what was expected for the Jordan line of products Overall I would recommend this shoe for the look the feel and to continue the Jordan signature line of products

I get lots of compliments every time that I wear these slides They are very comfortable to wear as well

Size up These run very small I would order 1 2 sizes up for a better fit that will be more comfortable

Slides very comfortable did not want to take them off my whole trip

I bought these for my teenage son He wishes that the top section was adjustable as to accomodate wearin socks underneath

The color of the slide rub off when I walk outside they slide off my feet and they are not as comfortable as I thought they were But I love the design of the slide

I bought this a few weeks ago and my boyfriend loves them they are his size and he has been wanting these for so long

I wear a size 10 in men and I went a head and went true to size and they wear a bit small I could still fit them but if you want to be able to grow into them I would go a size up it even half a size

Clean shoe Very authentic If you do not like the rustic style then these are not for your feet

Great quality easy to wear Nice shoe for summer

Fit is comfortable great for any day

They feel good look great what else could be said They are Jordans

Great shoe Although when they came in the mail they were already worn with crease marks on the toe the bottoms were dirty the heel had scuffs from dragging his foot and the size sticker on the inside of the heel was worn Who knew finishline was basically a goodwillAwesome job though I will definitely never buy shoes again from here

They were very uncomfortable made my feet hurt the first time I wore them

This is a great spin on a great shoe michael jordan has done it again

Upon opening the box these shoes appeared flawed Noticable dullness to the leather on the shoeupper it almost looked as though someone had attempted to clean select areas of the show with water Also there were at least 2 leather scuffs I will also note small albeit noticeable shoe glue carelessness which presumably originated from the production process kids make for poor craftsmen This the 2nd pair of shoes I have ordered from finish line and noticed flaws may be my last

A great and comfortable shoe These shoes can go with many things and is a great summer shoe Materials are great quality and sure to last a while

I like the retros because they are comfortable and stylish These particular ones also had a reasonable price point The only thing I wish is that Finish Line attempt to acquire new colors powder blue of this style

This color will not catch the average personeye because it is a bit boring But what it lacks in flash it more than makes up for in quality The leather is supple the touch is soft It feels like Nike Jordan Brand took it back to the days when material mattered I am glad the kids ignored this because this is worth the buy It fits like a normal Jordan 3 still heavy like a brick on your feet but this is a grown ups shoe Clean without all the frills and that is why I really like it

Great quality and the most comfortable retros I have bought Highly recommended

Kept looking at this shoe did not get it when it dropped held in hand could not find my size searched the sites and finish line had my 14 then to top off marked down to 149 99 then additional 20 off buck20 crazy should have copped two classic black and white hope to catch some more of these prices we can do this every week

I bought these shoes because I have a wide foot Comfortable good material and the cheapest Retro 3you will find on the market

Getting my shipment was painless and easy They came a day early Might have to look for more deals in the future

When I received the shoes the box was ripped and the shoes were creased like they had been worn

The comfort on these are insane and possibly the best deal on Jordanright now do not sleep on these Thank you Finishline you always have the best sales on Jordan Retro for years I used my 20 Reward on these This shoe goes hard I am just saying

I have not had a chance to wear them and I may not get a chance since I own like a hundred pairs

Great shoe a lot of people sleep on this shoe great material

But I was sent a pair that had creases and were dirty Seems I am not the only one who that happened to Good kicks overall tho

I already liked these shoes when I first seen them so I had to buy When I got them I was surprised to see how good quality the leather is Great pickup

Was dissapointed when I reviewed the shoes in the mail and they looked to be worn already with creases Took them to my local mall to swas them out Almost every pair looked to have been dirty Craftsmanship could be better Still had marks on the white midsole that I could not get out and scratches on the leather But still a good shoe for the sale price

Good price and condition of the box was not that beat up

These shoes caught my attention awhile back but I was hesitant to buy them I am glad I did because they are much better looking in person The leather used on this general release is probably the best I have seen in the last 10 15 years My only complaint is that the midsole could have been done better

I did not really plan on buying until I went to store and felt them in hand Omg this leather is bananas This is truly a great cut of leather This is hands down the best leather quality I have ever felt on a Jordan 3 They even got the st and of approval from Perfect Pair Wish that leather was on the true blues though

Great materials midsole was cheaply painted however Fits truer to size than previous releases which seemed to run a little big in the 10 5 sizes And for the price almost 60 under retail it was a no brainer

The shoes were made will a lesser quality of material uppers and sole In particular the way the sole was attached to the uppers was done sloppily There was overglue at the attach point

Love my Cyber Monday 3I got them at a price that was too good to pass up Thanks Finish Line for always keeping me fresh at a great price

Sole had lousy paint job though Liked it more with some black on the sole Great price with discount code

Fit still runs true to size a beloved classic in any colorway

Classic styling can never go wrong with Jordan 3 silhouette Materials are premium soft tumbled leather and inner sole are extra comfy compared to the past releases The black and white cyber color way can go with almost everything you throw at it in your closet and easily be the go to sneaker My only compliant on these shoes are they should have painted the white sole on the side better Overall I am very blessed to have these and if I had the space I would easily double up on these

Nice quality leather with decent comfort Had to go half size down due to heel slippage Toe box a little tight but can tell its stretching gradually Looks great with a lot of outfits My suggestion go half size down if you do not have wide feet

The retro 3s are my favorite and this version has 2 of my favorite colors Dope shoes

Glad I waited for a price reduction on these I was rewarded with great materials great comfort perfect fit

Durable and of decent quality Some of these Jordando not live up to the hype or the price but this is a decent pair

Most under rated shoe best buy of the year

Shoes are great Very comfortable Size is just right Only bad thing on hot days the shoes could make your feet hot These 3are awesome none the less

The sport blue 3are another sharp sneaker to add to the collection If you are into 3get off the fence and buy them already you will not be disappointed

Love the Retro 3 and this colorway Quality is par which could always improve but would definitely recommend them

great quality very comfortable eye catching

the air jordan 3 is one of my favorite jordan styles other than the 11over the quality at times disappoints me for the cheaper material and the higher price but with that said these are comfortable fit to size they do not run small and are very comfortable i would recommend anyone to buy a pair of air jordan 3 

Gotta get um but the quality must match the price

GREAT SHOE TRUE TO SIZE GOOD QUALITY WOULD BUY AGAIN

Great classic silhouette good overall shoe

classic jordan shoes

I did not realize retro were out until I saw these at the store After wearing them I immediately remember the stiff toe box and the creasing I almost forgot most shoes were made of leather back in the day Super comfortable and I love the large tongue I am a fan and will buy more high quality Jordan retro especially now that I can afford them

If you ever had a Jordan III than you know how they fit it is a timeless design You can wear these sneaker with anything to almost any event The leather on these shoe are great

It was a good cop now that we know the threes are being stopped production Very comfortable but so so quality It would be better if it was remastered 

The 3are my favorite out of the entire Jordan Brand hands down I will go above and beyond for my 3 

can not ever go wrong with Jordans Good shoe and since I got the wolf greys they go with pretty much everything

Bought as bday gift for my 15 yr old son He loved it Made his friends jealous and me1 mom

I recently purchased the Sport Blue Air Jordan 3which were hard to get because they sold out quickly However I was very disappointed because there is glue over spray on the side of the shoe Which is very noticeable and not to mention the money a customer spends on Air Jordan shoes I would expect the shoes to be in mint condition Finish Line needs to make sure the shoes all are selling is in mint condition before shipping them to a customer My next purchase will not be online and I will make store purchases for now on so I make sure the shoe I purchase is in mint condition

Shoes are nice they came pretty quick I like the fact I was able to order them on linea popular shoe in the store

The retro 3 is a nicely done show Feels great

Shoe Fits Nice Colorway is nice and looks good with shorts or pants

did not like the shoes one bit they fit me well but was very uncomfortable and had bad quality The shoe was very overpriced and did not perform to my expectations the only good part about the she is that it fit well

Good quality shoe with great comfort did not like the detailing on the elephant print too much but over all a solid shoe

I absolutely love these shoes These are one of my favorite pair of Jordans and the color options were great They match with nearly everything I wear as they are white black and gray Also they were cost less that 200 Personally I would not play basketball in them as they are just for looking fly Great deal and you can not go wrong with these shoes

One of my favorite Jordan retros and one of the shoes I could not afford growing up

Excellent sneaker delivered very quickly I am very satisfied with my order

I bought retro 3s for the first time and did not know what sit to get I looked it up and everyone said it runs half a size bigger I agree but when you buy it a half a size smaller it may feel a little tight a first but it is alright after a couple wears it will feel VERY comfortable And you are thinking about buy 3s a little bigger do not do it cause they do run big just get a half a size smaller wear it a couple time and trust me you will not regret buying it small Fits VERY nice and is VERY comfortable

It has a great leather upper The style and design forms well to my foot like the shoe was made for me Comfortable great quality and very stylish works with any look casual or dress All in all a product that stands out in my opinion Two thumbs up if you ask me As I said on of my favorite product

These Cool Grey 3s are nice IMO these are the sweetest colorway of the Air Jordan 3 Since I have had these all I have been hearing is Hey man nice 3s

Great shipping experience Got my shoes exactly when they were supposed to arrive Love my new Jordans

Only problem for me is the tumbled leather creases very easily Other than that you can not go wrong with any Jordan 3

The Wolf Grey 3s were my first pair of Retros I bought The shoe itself look really dope but my problem is there were a lot of paint flaws along the mid sole and a little tag sticking out of the cement print which I was very disappointed to see I thought the price of the shoe could of been a little lower like around 150 because it was not a premium release Hopefully in the future the quality and price of the Retro 3s become better

shoe is a five star other then fit is a 1 2 size small the regular but hey 4 out 5 are not bad

The shoe is very nice Quality is great

One of the most popular and iconic Jordans ever made Where ever you go in with these it is instant sneaker envy everywhere Needless to say I love them and I also got my brother a pair

Love these kicks have not had them on my feet since I was a kid when they 1st came out The most comfortable Jof all time Love rocking them with Jeans

Its the best shoe I have worn in all the jordans I have bought Very happy customer here Cant wait to see more colors in the future

new infrared 23 color does not over power the shoe makes it feel like an original OG color love the black tongue favorite jordan number ever

Love the shoe it is super comfortable and it looks great the one thing I would say I would change would be the laces I would prefer to have black laces instead of the white laces which I will personally change but the shoe is great

Get a sneaker that will always be a game changer

GREAT QUALITY CLASSIC JORDANS IN A NICE LOOKING COLORWAY SIZE RAN A BIT BIG FOR ME ALL MY JARE 9BUT THESE FELT HALF A SIZE ALMOST TOO BIG GOOD QUALITY AND COMFORTABLE SO FAR

These shoes particularly the threethe most comfortable Jordan Brand shoe their is out of all of them in my opinion I would recommend this brand to any one looking for the best quality and fitting Jordan shoe

Fine shoe for casual wear but would not recommend as a performance shoe due to lack of forefoot cushion If you want to use it as a performance shoe I suggest a different insole They also run small I went a half size down Also look even better with black laces instead of white

I had the original when I was a kid then again in the 90  and now again Probably one of the best retrogoing Every pair I had lasted forever with the all leather upper Quality seems to be as good as every having owned the different ones threw out the years

they are nice and look fine but they run a lil bit bigger than usual and they are not that confortable

I highly doubt many Jordan purchasers are going straight to the basketball court with them especially the retros most of us will know the Jordan quality value could Always be better with a lower price and every pair of Nikes Jordan I have ever owned has ran small But again most Jordan purchasers know what they are getting into when buying a pair and we all have our love hate relationship with

This was a great shoe The leather and attention to detail are top rate The shoe is about a 1 4 size big and I usually always run TTS I bought tongue pads and they seem to work

New color way of my favorite shoe what more could you ask for except more of the sameI can not wait until July for the Wolf Grey model

All Jordanare top quality and the Jordan III is no different it is stylish and comfortable The price is as high as we have all come to expect with the Air Jordan brand but if you are a sneakerhead or just a casual Jordan user the III is a must have They go good with jeans and shorts and are sure to turn heads Comfort is 5 stars and they are very durable I wish the price were lower but I have no complaints at all

love the feel and quality waiting on new colors

Quality is obviously not like before as these are more lifestyle shoes rather than basketball shoes However the look is timeless for any Jordan fan

Air Jordan 3 very comfortable on and off the court True to size for anyone to rock Thanks finish line

I was amazed by this shoe The Jordan 3 Infrared is must have for collectors One of the most comfortable pairs of kicks I have ever owned They are so fly every detail and every stich is placed perfectly I have a lot of shoes and these are instant classic

The shoes are very versatile they look good with almost everything ranging from jeans shorts and joggers Comfort wise they fit very well and perfect for just a simple day walking around or a day playing a sport

Huge Fan of the Retro 3 and this shoe fits perfectly into the collection The elephant print looks great as always and the black tongue makes the shoe pop and the quality and texture of the material on the tongue is superb and clean looking

Ordering from Finishline tops the competitors on the other websites I will not mention there is no kind of order when Jordans are released slow and laggy

Overall good shoe good quality and a nice simple color way I switched the white laces out for black a better look in my opinion

Great product great alternative for those who do not have the white cement 3

This was the shoe that really made the brand The one and 2 were cool but this was was trendsetting and groundbreaking

Overall solid retro the leather is tuff better than the other retro IIIs that came out so far

I love everything about these shoes The color style and comfort I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes

Great looking shoe on feet especially with jeans Really comfortable Air Jordan The quality is not impressive though The paint will still start cracking a year after wearing them My shoes also came pre creased Other than that they are ok

The 3are always a great fit and stylish shoe all around

WAITING FOR THE SUMMER TO ROCK THESE DOPPPEEEE

Jordan brand has increased quality of product this year The retro 3 is 4 colors white light grey black and powder blue the shoe starts with a light grey and black bottom mostly grey with powder blue JORDAN in lettering Mid sole is white with a black upper mid sole and powder blue air bubble Upper is made of four layers We have powder blue elephant print along the heel and covering the outside of the toe box area Powder blue suede with tumbled pebble look upper Black suede tongue white stitched Jump man black shoe laces We have a black plastic heel guard with JUMP MAN and A I are in white Grey elephant print liner powder blue insole with white jump man Shoe comes with clear and red plastic Jordan accessorie

love the shoes had them when i was a kid and had to have them again

Excellent buy Excellent service I can always count on Finishline to purchase the new hot release items online when I have never been able to for any other store

This jordan retro three is the best looking retro three out of all them They are very high quality and fit very well The only down side is you have to be careful they manage to crease easily but I managed to keep them uncreased They are easy to keep clean If I were you I would buy these to step up your sneaker game

These are my first pair of 3and they are cool They are comfortable unique and a nice shoes in general

It was no problem purchasing this shoe Finish Line site is perfect for Saturday morning releases the shoe came sufficient time with no trouble I will most definitely do business in the future

This is the best shoe ever made in my opinion I play alot of basketball and would recommend this shoe to anyone The most stylish ever and high performing on the court it is the perfect height to secure your ankle and not constrict plus the most stable base The only negative if any it was 110 originally in 1988 now they price it at 170

I wouldnt try and use them on the court even thought some of the NBA has I like them as an occasional fancy wear



Good pair of shoes fit good They are true to size

I was surprise and very happy I was still able to purchase the powder bue Jordan iii on finishline great looking shoes and very comfortable

Just cant go wrong with the 3Any color 170 aint bad But JB is smart cuz they come out with a color and nothing you already have matches so you end up buying the matching clothes too

what can I say Jordanspeak for themselves this color way is hot great to show a collection

Great show if you like all shades of blue did not like the leather nubuck mixture on the upper Powder blue 3s are to me a shoe for boys ages 5 11 and girls of all ages

Well for new comers

GOOD SHOE GOTTA HAVE THEM IN YOUR LIFE WEAR THEM ENJOY

Easy to review this one just an iconic Jordan shoe A must have for any Jordan fan Love the color love the 3 If you have the chance to buy this shoe do it you will not be disappointed

I have wanted the 3s for a long time I finally got it and I was so excited The shoe has a leathery skin so the creases do not shoe as much as others The toe run a little too narrow so if you are flat foot I encourage you to buy a half size up

I love the retro jordan I am old school when they come out I have to get them for me and my son And Finish line always have them when I need them never leaving the house to purchasing them

One of my favorite JLove the color combination and style

can not go wrong the Fire Red Retro 3 Jordans Definitely a must have in the collection

Shoe is sick First pair of Jordanand definitely did not disappoint I loved these shoes the moment I opened the box The only thing is that they crease EASILY and shoppers should consider maybe a half size smaller or getting a shoe shield But definitely worth the buy

This shoe was really comfortable Fits well to size

nowadays retros are becoming popular Alot of people are buying them and are immediatley selling out online on release day these shoe are comfortable but the most The quality is ok The sizing is good I would not play basketbal in jordans unless you want to ruin the condition of the shoe overall i give the shoe an 7 8 10 rating

do not get me wrong The shoes are good but at 160 I need and want great They are strong and as comfortable as other basketball shoes but the sole lends itself more to a fashion shoe than a functional high traction basketball shoe Expect looks compliments and envy not functionality

Not only did my shoe box come in perfect condition footlocker always sends me destroyed boxes but the shoe was great No creases and nice quality Lastly the finish line twitter team was extremely helpful when my original order did not go through Good pickup

they are good looking no flaws and comftable

Wish I could tell you it is walking in these because every time I put them on I start floating

Awsome shoe to good to pass up had them before and now rocking them again Fresh

I purchased these to replace the ones I bought in 2006 So far I have no complaints

These babies are a must have in any shoe collection If you can find your size Get them

This shoe is stylish and very comfortable There were no mishaps with the pair i received from finish line It is a fresh shoe and Jordan wore them in the playoffs

these pairs are very comfortable the leather and stitching is top quality jordan took a little more time with this release I am guessing I will definitely recomend these pairs for starters

wanted cement 3s but could not get them so I settled for these all I can say is that there comfortable nice quality and a nice shoe to wear with almost anything

Great shoe good quality looks great with pants and shorts have not played in them yet probably not the best performer due to the 1980technology like the polyurethane midsole but they would still get the job done Overall one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own

Very good quality Light comfortable and well made

I am glad I could finally get a pair of Jordans I have been trying for 8 months online and calling in Im deployed in Afghanistan and its very difficult to get Jordans I wish something could be done about this

Very stylish comfy and go great with pretty much anything They just crease really easily

As we all know Retro Jordans go on sale at 8am on a specific release date did not have any real problem with getting these kicks ordered It took a few times but it went through I am very happy a went with finish line BTW Jordans are fres

These are one of the most comfortable pair of JordanThey fit true to size and are very soft Love the color way and they are stylish

I Love These shoes their comfortable Great Looking and they fit perfect I cant tell you how many complements I get on these shoes I feel so good wearing these makes me feel like a superstar but no one is taking pictures like the paparazzi Either way if your thinking of buying these I would say its a no brainier you will not regret it

This show is so lightweight and comfortable Played ball in them and they kept me very supported Best sneaker I have bought this year

I bought 2 pairs and both had flaws It had nothing to do with finishline but Jordan Brandquality control 1 pair had two different shades of red Some parts were not even painted properly But thats just me being picky Still one of my favorite shoes of all time

The shoes are great and fit perfect The only issue I have is with UPS The shipping box that I got them in was mangled and so were the shoe boxes inside the shipping box This is the first time out of many purchases I ever had a bad shipping experience Luckily the shoes were in great condition except one out of the two pairI bought had pretty good creasing in the toe box area on one shoe I know it is common in the retro 3to have some toe box creasing I do not know about anybody else but I like them crisp and in mint condition when I am paying 160 a pair I know it is not finish linefault though with shipping and UPS should handle their packages better I would definitely highly recommend finish line for purchasing sneakers and clothing I always receive fast shipping and they are always helpful and professional when dealing with them

one of my favorite air jordans

A must have shoe for any Jordan sneakerhead Fred Savage wore it in the Wonder Years Jordan wore it in his early days

This shoe quality is great it feels great looks fresh fits perfect and confortable great style Love it I think every body should have it

this shoes still look fresh on my feet i compare it to my og one and i will be honest yall quality aint that good back in the days but shoes on point i rock them like every other week

Great for casual wear and on the court Fits true to size and 3s are always a must cop

These were not ware house shipped pair from release day these we a return and I would have taken them back too But the store did not care no hang tag no shoe trees and dirty sock liner There was a split on the elephant print on 1 shoe along with the rips on the tongue Jordan Brand and Nike do not care had a pair of Griffeywith upside down 24

A very comfortable shoe that fits true to size The traction is good for both indoor better or outdoor use The material is nice but of course this shoe creases bad at the toe box The paint job could have been better as you can tell some of the paint strokes on the white portions towards the sole but you have to look Still over all quality is real good The red appears to be close to the red on the Crimson 3 This is a solid 4 out of 5 shoe The shoe will get the job done on the court

Great sneaker for casual use Only problem with these are the mid sole cracking

Love the color way Looks great with shorts or jeans

amazing color scheme awesome fit and feel Wears well with whatever your style

Good sneaker but the Crimson Red is hard to match up withshirts

I have purchased 4 pairs of this shoe so that when one wears out I have back ups This is actually one of my favorite retro 3 color ways The back of the sole does not crack like most 3do And the shoe just looks good over all it is not a perfomance shoe so you can not expect it to be incredibly comfortable but it is worth the price Trust me get them before they sell out This shoe will be much more memorable than the black flips or jokers I have collected for 23 years and I know how the trends fall

I am in it for the style if I still balled tho I would not rock these being that the color way is more for an outfit since it stands out At first I was not interested but now looking at them more I fall more in love with these bad boys Plus I love the look of J3Mine came a lil wrinkled at the toe box but overall like the shoes do not sleep on these

3m is weak on these but other than that it is a perfect pair i love these

Great shoe Goes with everything and is very comfortable True to size

Awesome shoe comfy as heck I can see why this was MJfavorite shoe in the line Love the unique color scheme if only I could get the 88 model too to match Wore these shoes to Padres opening day this year I swear at the end of the day my feet were great but my legs were tired as heck from all the walking I did in them

Very comfortable shoe but creases easy Like the unique colorway and eye opening when in public

I think I heard that these were Kobefavorite Jordans I am not sure maybe it was the IV But the one thing that I do know is that my wife absolutely loves the Retro IIIAt first she was not a fan but after wearing them around a few times the shoes became her favorite I just wish they would add some more modern advancements in the Jordan Retro releases but I guess if they did that it would not be a Retro anymore

I really like this new colorway I think a lot of people slept on these But I would recommend this shoe The 3M on the shoe really makes it nice I also like the comfort this shoe is true to size and feels like all the other 3What I also noticed is when Jordan brand makes a new colorway the quality is definately better than a are retro of an old colorway I would get this just for that

3 series are always nice looking these are nicer color especially for women

Surprisingly found these shoes on the Finish Line website when all others had long been out My first pair of Jordanas a kid were the 3and I was pumped to find a new Retro pair from a reputable store These are amazing

The crimson retro 3 were a shoe I was not really in to but as soon as I put them on I liked them a whole lot There a comfortable shoe with a nice color wave Had many head turns

Im a big Jordan Air Max and retro Nike collector For me the best Jordans ever were the 1s and 3 6 This is a great colorway not too loud and flashy and still very reminiscent of the originals But I hope they are release the black elephant retros of the original 3s soon too Meanwhile though Im wearing these occasionally and my other 3s continue to appreciate so its all good

I love the shoes shopping with you guys has always been a great experience i look forward to doing more business with Finishline Thanks

For the price this shoe is an absolute waste of money

Im a fan of micheal jordan shoes this one is very nice and cool for casual

I purchased the crimson 3to add to my vast collection of shoes I am overall very impressed with these shoes My only problem is I wish that the purple elephant print was more noticeable

What do you expect I paid almost 200 with shipping and handling for these just because I could not get the BREDS on Jordan Saturday and my size was becoming hard to find The shoes are pretty comfortable for my casual use and look reeeallly good The purple does not seem to show as much as you might expect and that neon red is fire

Look great fit great ajs tend to run a bit big but works out great since I like roomy casuals would not think about ballin with them so disregard 3 star performance If you do not mind paying a pretty penny buy emjust not on ebay

Classic AJ 3 with a pretty sick non OG colorway Super comfy Comes with two pair of laces

We are loyal customers

The title nails it it is like a Grade School Only colorway

I am typically right in between a size 10 and 10 5 I picked up a size 10 and they fit perfectly These sneakers look and feel fantastic A great addition to my Jordan collection Very happy to cop at retail from Finishline Many people sleeping on the colorway but not me love them

These shoes are great for everyday life Just casual walking and looking fresh I wear mine for school and because these are slept on I always get good compliments Though I would not recommend balling in this shoe or running These shoes are easy to clean and worth the money

These Jordanare awesome Some might say they are minimilistic and that they lack the flair of subsequent Jordanbut they are the Jordan 3which speak for themselves I am a Jordan collector so I am kind of biased especially when it comes to Jordanhe wore during his career in Chicago or that I owned as a kid Of the 18 different pairs of Jordanthat I own including fan favorites such as the I VI XI these are one of my favorites Be warned the toe box will crease so if you intend to wear them and that is something that will bother you you will want to get something that helps prevent creasing from occuring

The shoes were just as advertised Great quality and everything you would expect from a pair of retros

These Jordanare excellent they are very comfortable to walk in and look good while you wear them

These shoes are really comfortable and i can wear it with even pants or shorts

Love the 3Looks good and quality of the retros are getting better

Great sneaker Very comfortable wore them for the first time yesterday and I can not complain

This shoe looks and feels great on feet really happy with the shoe Great Value Unique Comfort Great with Jeans Good Quality too

these shoes are great for basketball respond well to cutting quick and jumping

First off let me say Ive been a loyal Jordan brand customer and fan for years but this shoe despite the awesome colorway and comfort is not worth the money I ordered online and recieved within a few days Shipping was like around 8 for me I opened the box only to be disappointed yet again by the quality of retros The left shoe was ok just some choppy stitching where the liner meets the leather but the right shoe was totally jacked up It had glue stains and scuffs like some one dropped it and worst of all a warped crooked toe box My heart sank I love Jordan sneakers but this is too much The shoe is really comfortable true to size and an awesome colorway I can clean the scuffs and glue and after some wear the toe box might settle in But we should not have to settle time after time for that after dropping 180 Bottom line great looking shoe TERRIBLE TERRIBLE quality

Awesome color Great fit so comfortable Super fast shipping Love them

look so good feel great and fit true to size cop them now

So glad I bought this shoe Very comfortable and look even better in personfamous187

good buy got 2 pairs no sweat

Love these So fresh and so clean clean Great value as well especially for some 3s They are unique and fresh does not get any better than that

Great shoe Everyone slept on it but looks really great on feet If you are having a hard time trying to decide LISTEN TO ME GET THEM runs true to size and very comfy CHANGE THE LACES lol

Its definitly not for balling All together great shoe creases very easymight wanna watch how you move on your toes Great look great feel Sneakerheads are sleeping on it which means theres plenty of units left in this style

dope shoe feels good looks good pricy but worth it

Jordan 3are the most comfortable ones they have made in my opinion If they are release these shoes you jump on them I always get great fast service through finish line

this is simply amazing Retro 3 is my favorite pair of jordan 

Jordan IIIare the greatest shoes ever in my opinion These are a sharp colorway of an old favorite

These shoes look just as better in person They are very comfortable They also stand out and you can wear them with just about anything Great purchase I would buy another pair

the shoe color is nice

everything about this shoe is great you can wear it with anything and i like the bright laces which is why i switched them

I have been rocking these almost every weekend since I got these Great looking shoe no doubt the crimson color really stands out Bright is the word I would like to describe the shoe Classic design with new colorways cop these with no hesitate

Awesome pair of sneakers Getting compliments all the time on them Another awesome Jordan release

The jordan 3 is a great shoe for everday casual comfort as well as for performace Like the new colorway too

This is one of the most comfortable basketball shoes I have ever had

This colorway is unique The crimson red and purple complement each other

I am really into sneakers These are very comfortable and look good Was happy with my purchase and Finish Line service

Absolutely love this show very comfy and quality is amazing

Pretty good sneakers they fit a little big but everything else to me was pretty fine

Its a awesome shoe but the colors are just a bit too much The crimson is actually really bright and when you see it in person its almost neon The only way the color scheme would work is if you happen to be a toronto raptors fan because the neon color and purple do not match well other than that its a awesome shoe

What more can you say about the Retro 3I receive so many compliments from people when I rock these Thank you FinishLine for a great online experience as well

One of the shoes did have a scuff mark

Awesome product as always I always enjoy ordering from finishline Great shoes and service all the time

The colorway is pretty neat like the Jokers but they are not a perfect fit and not perfect construction I normally wear a 9 but should have gotten an 8 5 for these After putting in force fields because of toe box creasing they feel right There are some production flaws on the paint near the air box like stringy peeling of the white paint Not worth the money This is more like a 120 shoe

I would like to just say these are my first pair of Jordan Retro 3Nice color scheme for the redesign of this classic shoe The crimson color is a nice touch as well as the purple elephant print it is a soft shoe that feels good with every step Only drawback is the toe of the shoes crease easily I had to invest in some shoe Force Fields which prevent shoes to crease at the toe With the exception of the crease of shoes I still like them on my feet

Jordan Retro 3 has been my all time favorite Even though it is not an OG colorway the shoeare still awesome Good for summer shoes especially the crimson red

Great shoe I had them back in 1988 So I had to buy them again Looks good feels good

These shoes are something different from the other jordans This colorway looks great with a pair of dark jeans These new jordans are starting to be better quality like the old ones Even though these say they are a basketball shoe they really arent made for the court These are a great casual shoe that will get you looks

There overall a good shoe

Shoe fits great could even go down a size because so comfortable as for the crimson it is not a true crimson color but more like a neon pink mix with neon orange I just got the crimson to customize but not a color way I like

People slept on these The color scheme was strange and would have been great if it was red but I will still rock them 3 times a year and get compliments

These are yet another great retro Jordan Brand shoe that delivers the confort styling and colorway that fit off the court or on

Always my favorite of the retro JordanI wear nothing but jordan and the retro 3are by far my favorite

I love my crimson 3a lot of people will regret sleeping on such great shoes I have always loved the retro 3and not matter what color way Jordan drops I HAVE to cop me a pair The crimson 3stand out so much especially with the crimson laces dope shoes for a great price

I do not ball in these I just rock these casually The IIIs are my favorite Jordan model so I try to scoop up any III release even if it is a non OG colorway These are comfortable decently made compared to the 2011 releases and are still easy enough to find Be aware that the crimson is pretty bright almost to an infrared or pinkish hue The purple is muted in person and can actually pass as a light grey I plan to rock these until they fall apart

Overall great shoe Very comfortable and great materials A must have for all retro 3 fans and JB fans

Very good shoe i use the crimson laces and it makes them pop

I was skeptical about buying the shoe at first did not really like the color way but it looks so much better in person Alot of people are sleeping on getting these shoes I may buy another pair The quality is actually better than the last few shoes Jordan Brand has released do not pass up on them

I think the shoes are super comfortable stylish and I love the color ways of the shoes I thought the shoes were made very well and it was really cool that it came with extra laces I am so glad to have got myself a pair of these shoes and it was easy to get myself a pair because in every retro jordan release its so hard to get a pair of shoes because of all the hype behind it Thank you Finishline

My favorite pair of shoes are jordan 3I am in love with the way they look I have 8 pairs of the shoe in all different colors This Joker release is a new colorway and I have to admit that it is pretty cool It has a neon look to it with the green and purple and then you have the black part about the shoe that brings the colors together I also really liked that the shoe came with two different color shoe laces extra stuff is always good

The 3s are always a solid sneaker This colorway is a good addition to the line up

The colors took some getting used to Great buy I did not have a pair of these yet very great casual shoe I would not recommend for performance

Fits true to size Color way is awesome in person the purple could have been a better shade though Comes with two pairs of laces so you can switch up the lace color Quality is ok My pairs toe box is kind of messed up wrinkled and has weird imprints pushing out of toe box Wish I could exchange but of course they are sold out so I can not

Very different colorway for the retro 3s The shoe is the same fit as the rest of retro 3s The purple color on the shoes are not very bright and the shoes come with replacement bright green laces Overall cool looking shoe

Thanks to all hypebeast for sleeping on these nice really good quality 3s i love them im a 73 so i come from this era when these was made i know whats up real head here and downs to the young just rock what you like not whats the latest hype

One of the most underated shoes out They so comfortable and they look great

Great shoe Good Quality Very interesting colorway Looks 100 better in person Many people are sleeping on these The purple is very dark on the shoes and hard to notice unless you are really looking for it

I recently got the box and when i decided to open them i check everything was fine except this one box was broken on the side it looks like someone just try to tear off the corner of the box =|

The pictures you see on the web do not do this shoe any justice I admit I did not like this shoe until I seen it in person and it was a must cop from there Normally retros are sold out the same day they release but a lot of people are sleeping on these I guarantee you that years down the line people are going to wish they would have copped these because you will break a lot of necks rocking these The purple is not even really noticible until you get up close on these Cop now while they are still available

These Crimson 3undoubtedly will be a colorway that many sneakerheads will look back on and wish they had not slept on them With all of the other releases the past couple of weeks its understandable why so many took a pass on the Crimsonbut after having them up close and on my feet they are definitely a great addition to my collection As with most other 3the fit is spot on and they go great with anything from jersey shorts to jeans The usual comfort is there and with the 3M on the tongue and around the midsoles the colors pop from every angle The brightness of the actual Crimson does seem to bother some people but I actually like the character that this new color gives to the sneaker I would definitely recommend them not only to sneakerheads but to the casual basketball fan Jordan supporter Get them while you still can because in a few years I know that many people will regret having slept on them in 2013

at first i was not sure about the Crimson colorway but when i got them i was extremely happy i did not realize they utilized 3M on the tongue and some on the mid sole area

another shoe people slept on most likely bc of the all star releases and the xx8 days of flight and MJs 50th day leading to a ton of restocks on more popular models these like the stealth 3s are sneaky in the attractiveness they are much nicer in person and with the 3m on tongue and around the midsole area they look different in all different lightings and times of day grab them if you are a fan of the 3s and you will not regret it

The shoes are awesome I was able to wear a 10 5 and was the perfect fit The shoes were in perfect condition and no flaw and received them within 5 calendar days

The 3are spectacular and I underated these shoes greatly

Like this one especially in original colorways Quality of retros is getting better

A lot of people slept on this color way Although it is not the traditional leather the suede and nubuck are of excellent quality and look lin tastic

Love these retros They are stylish and have a great comfortable fit They look awesome with a pair of jeans for a night out on the town I would definitely recommend these 

Recommended

I Love The Shoes

This is a pretty sick shoe The retro III stealth is like the air jordan I stealth of course the difference its a retro III The Stealth Grey is what make this shoe but the other neet feature are it has the Elephant print on them and it has the Snake skin print too witch make them stand out not to forget that shiny black mid sole and that touch of Varsity Red on the shoe lace eye lids that makes this shoe stand out even more Another thing that cauth my eye was the two piece box with the big jordan logo and the cement bottom its a comfortable shoe and it looks good over all

Great pair of kickz took a while to sell out but guess everyone finally came to their senses lol

These retro jordanallow everyone to remember am when he was flying high and winning rings They are a great way to start off 2012 or any chance you are able to pick them up

the retro 3 is always a clean shoe and this colorway is just so nice The nubuck is very close to a suede it feels great i love the way the shoe feels when you work just all around great shoe i recommend getting it

These Retro Jordan 3 basketball shoes are really cool Although some fans do not like the color scheme on this one I think that the look is awesome The greyand black contrast very well and the shoes have just the right amount of red for my tastes These are likely not the basketball shoe but in terms of sneaker fashion these Jordans are another excellent pair

Great Quality and comfort Colors are exactly as pictured

Thanks Finishline

I do not care what people say i love this shoe People complain about the quality but hey it is good enough for me The Jordan 3 is one of my favorite Jordans They are so comfortable True to size Especially the Black Cements they are beautiful and go with mostly any outfit I recommend everyone to get these

Not a popular color way but they look nice and are comfortable also true to size

Lots of style Comfortable for walking around Gave 3 stars for performance because I would not recommend playing basketball in them Great deal because I got them on sale at finishing

The nubuck makes a fantastic combination with the rest of the leather and it does not get dirty easily

These 3are a great add to any collection Plus they are comfortable and look great with pants or shorts

jordan did a real good job with this retro i suggest buying a 5 to 1 size bigger than your normal size they look really nice withh jeans and shorts they have elephant print AND iguana print the white laces really pop off the shoe and that looks really dope also i suggest NOT wearing these for bball just wear them too look fly as heck

great shoe goes great with my other 70 pr air jordans

The retro 3 that I originally wanted to buy for my son was out of stock so I went we these ones and he loves them They fit great and look awesome on him Glad I purchased them

Still love the Black Cements Feels about the same as the previous BC releases If you can definitely worth purchasing Great with the denim and Jumpman Polo outfit

One of the most stylish pair of kicks in the Jordan line it is comfortable and you get a ton of compliments when wearing them out I highly recommend these shoes if you can get your hands on them

Loved the shoe and was on sale which convince me to purchase one Its more comfortable than my black red stealth Spizike Would never play basketball with these other than street wear

This sneakers is one of the best sneakers i have ever bought its comfortable and the overall appearance of the sneaker is awesome considering the fact that it is a limited release i consider it to be a CLASSIC and a must have I would definitely recommend anybody to buy it

retro 3s are one of my favorite jordans so these were an automatic for me as long as these are worn casually and not to play in they are one of the most comfortable shoes i wear

I love these shoes I bought them as they released and was really happy that I was able to get these retro Jordans

These are so cool and comfortable Add black or red laces and they look even better

Will shop here again and again

Happy with my black cement 3my favorite Jordans by far

the Black Cement 3u2032s are a special shoe The cement print the AIR bubble the tumble leather the iconic Jordan Mars Blackmon commercials all add up to give the Cement 3u2032s an air of greatness Overall I am happy with my purchase Finishline did a super job with the fast shipping

Cool shoe great price

These shoes are sharp they go with lots of styles and they just look good on your feet The bonus is if you want to play basketball they excel on the court too can not beat the price

it is not an OG colorway but you can never go wrong with some Jordan 3s

One of the hottest shoes out Extremely hard to find Great design Very Comfortable

I think that this is one of the best shoes that Jordan has created It is simply a solid shoe The colorway is beautiful and the elephant print adds so much to the shoe To sneakerheads this shoe is and will be legendary as it is an OG Jordan colorway They are fairly comfortable and I love wearing them

Great looking comfortable and quality shoe They look fly with jeans and a suit A must for sneaker freaks

Great product

I love these JI miss getting these when I was in school but I got a second chance so I cop them

Love the Jordan IIIThey are on of my favorite retro Jordans Really comfortable and they look great with jeans A must buy if you can get them

I am a huge jordan fan I acutally got the cement 3s which were sold out like 2 seconds after my purchase but I LOVE THEM

Classic shoe must have

the leather is a bit too shiny and the midsoles are far too white but

this is second to none my favorite kicks of all time

not as nice as the black 3 

The black cement colorway was a mandatory addition to my collection One of my favorite 

These are the greatest and best looking Jordans of all time I love the cements so much I bought 2 pairs

One of the best all time jordans

bummer that it is synthetic leather but thats the way it is always been

these joint is a classic model you need to have them Also they came back with a high quality level those are a must BUY

Pretty dope shoe love the Jordan brand retro

The Retro 3 provides the comfort needed in a basketball shoe The sizing is accurate and its performance on the court is outstanding I recommend this shoe to any ball player

They are a Christmas gift so I can not rate them at this point They looked great in the box though

Great Shoe for any Jordan lover Not as highly praised as some of the other Retro 3s but definitely a very nice shoe regardless Comfortable and stylish

picked this up cyber monday for 100 with a coupon code and they are good for what i payed but i would not pay 150 for the quality and comfort that they have to offer overall one con to this is the white sole making it get dirty easily If you can get them cheap buy them but I would avoid paying retail just like any non rare jordan

I bought these because i always wanted them and i have the slides to match Had some great service with getting some nice laces and some force fields I bought them knowing what to expect high quality classic looks and the best in the world everything else They lived up to expectations The comfort is second to none the size is perfect even at a higher size and the quality and performance can only be described as Jordan stature I payed 150 i would pay three times that They are legendary iconic and the best Quite simply they are Jordan 

I bought the stealth 3 Jordanand it was a fantastic purchase I would recommend these to anybody as I did my best friend and he has already bought himself a pair as well If you want a comfortable reliable pair of basketball shoes or everyday shoes this is a pair you should add to your collection then you will definitely be noticed

Im not gonna lie this is probably the ugliest colorway jordan has ever put out for a pair of 3s do not get me wrong 3s are really nice these just look terrible

air jordan 3 this one is not the most stylish pair of the 3but comfort and craftsmanship is top notch what you would expect from JB could be worn with jeans or shorts looks good

These shoes are comfortable and really nice looking Great value for the money

Pretty much the coolest looking Jordan in my opinion The elephant print in the front and back has pretty cool contrast with the snake print in the middle I like how these are mids they go good with shorts or Jeans The stealth grey is awesome with the red I wear a size 8 and they fit absolutely perfect Very comfortable

one of the greatest pairs of Jordans ever

Where to start off these shoes fit great The look great and not to mention give you an extra 3 inches to you height or so it feels I am glad Jordan brought these back because they are so FRESH

I love this shoe It is stylish and well made They are comfortable once broken in I am glad they decided to retro this shoe as it is one of my favorites You will not be disappointed in this purchase

One of the most comfortable shoes out of the Jordan collection The added swoosh gives the 3 series that extra pop which stands out to my liking I feel real good when I step out in these bad boys

Great colorway to add to your collection These will look great in the late summer and early fall on college campus

Great shoes Great fit The shoes Feels like they did in the 90

TTS Looks are eye catching Comfortable surrounding foot but not the sole Odd though that the Nike Airmax high tech sole does not make for a very cushioned ride Was expecting to be walking on air Instead I feel the hard impact of every step

I was not a huge fan of this model of shoe I thought it was sort of ugly at first but when I bought them and tried them on they are not bad at all They fit perfectly and are super comfortable I have not had them long enough to test durability but they look fantastic and you are getting your moneyworth

Just came in today A good fitting shoe for me I have narrow feet and could stand a more narrow shoe As some reviews notes they are not the most comfortable sole but the feel and fit is good The bottom of mine are not white they have a tint to them Not sure if that is normal or not I will try them next week on the court

This shoe fits well very comfortable I was kind of skeptical of the design however they look even better when you are wearing them

These royal blue retro 3for me are true to size super comfortable and very clean looking The color combo of royal blue grey white and red go perfect together They go with almost any outfit you put on

the service choosing to get this is great and I love how its unique to others

i got these for christmas and love the way they look They Kill my feet thought i have ordered and bought the epic react vapor max TB max 93 along with many other and love them but for some reason this pair just wont break in or my foot isnt right for it slaughters my pinky toe after about two hours of wearing so sad

Looks and feels great 10 10 would recommend to a friend

Great fit very comfy You can rock them with shorts jogger and or jeans can not go wrong

Worth the price They are lite comfortable and highly functional training sneakers They also have reflective black strips for safely running at night Im glad I purchased these

It looks beautifull the leather is perfect the shoes is comfortable It is easy to clean up It is good quality tbh I can not complain this product The best retro I have ever had

The leather is plush and feels good what else can i say Worth getting

Amazing quality in the leather liked the colorway online loving the colorway in person and on feet Glad I choose this colorway over the OG Blue Black on Black logogo HARD

Highly recommended for comfort Best retro made and fits with current fashion

I have been wearing Jordans ever since they came out and these blew me away

 thanks

I love the color material and styling elements of this shoe However I did find that with all of the 3s releasing in 2014 that they all ran smaller than normal This was a disappointment I did not like the sizing But I still highly recommend this shoe for styling and current fashion Add this shoe to your collection

Amazing keychain one of the best ever Very good quality Keys stay on for sure

The price tag is validated in quality every penny These shoes are a classic for the simple and strong Jordan attire fan Will definitely purchase the next exclusive pair Not a collector but I am a fan of good quality shoes

All around good comfortable Jordan retro Only bad is they crease more than others on toe box

Buy a pair you wont regret it Very comfortable 3are one of my favorite

Shoe is comfortable and hopefully the side color will not chip to early in time Overall the shoe is clean

The Jordan 3 is one of my favorite This shoe is one of the best since it is very comfortable and A quality Thank you Nike for bringing back the fresh kicks

A big fan of AJ retros and this was a must cop thx

I never wore the shoes I purchased them for a friend but they did not live up to the hype that I thought Even though they were sellouts they did not sell as well as the Retro 11s I think the purple should have been left off of the shoe

definitely pleased with these 3s color combo is better than expected

A classic all purpose shoe that fits true and looks amazing on the foot

These are some of my favorite shoes period They are extremely comfortable and ever since I started wearing low top sneakers to play ball in the IIIs are my favorite

I have had the True Blues and Cements for 2 years and they still look brand new

I love the NIKE AIR hope they keep doing this thanks NIKE COM

at first i was skeptical of this shoe but overall this is a swag shoe i had to change the white laces though they look so much better with black laces it goes with everything and is an instant classic

This is the shoe that kept MJ with Nike Thank you Tinker for designing the Jordan 3 I currently have 10 pairs of Jordanin my closet The Jordan 3are my favorite they are very comfortable look nice and all eyes are at these shoes when i wear them

So lucky to have these great sneakers Remember back in the day when these first popped I am preety sure it was the same weekend MJ won the Dunk contest against Wilkins I too was an Air Jordan cult member after AJ 1 These do and will continue to hold up as one of the best sneakers in history Air Jordan Air Jordan Air JordanMars 

I was in the 4th grade when this shoe dropped The first Jordan I fell in love with Come Fly with Me Dunk Contest etc this shoe started it all for me Oh did I mention how good the shoe looks Lol

I got the black and cement grey color in an 8 5 I work at finish line so I definitely had my pair set aside These shoes are pure beauty I got the retro socks and the AJ3 hoodie to go along with it The shoe is pretty comfortable and the black leather helps to hide creases in the toe box I feel proud to own and wear these shoes

c and ed out for 4 hours and 45 minutes for these babies cant wait to showcase them at school

Shoe is great from the leather to the elephant print to the classic outsole and varsity red jumpman to the beautiful box that it comes in In all this is a great shoe but you must consider the creasing on the toe box which is the only con of this shoe

I am a big fan of the Air Jordan 3The black 3are the best of all the color ways A classic shoe Thanks for bringing them back Copped 4 pairs

these jordans are just amazining they turn more heads than you could imagine plus the sway on them looks vary good and suprisingly easy to clean had them for more than 3 months and still look stealth looks the best BEST RETROS

great looking shoe with jeans and shorts on feet has soo much style gets lots of compliments just creases easily

They are not as comfortable as my Retro 7 Cardinals but they sure look great with jeans I swapped out the white laces with black laces on mine

Great shoe wear it casually mainly with jeans or khakis love the style colorway stealth and material defs recommend you use a suede nubuck protector for these boys fits to size gotta love the retro 3s

If it was all about comfort i would give the shoe a perfect 5 stars I love the feel of them and they run true to size The color way is decent the white strings kinda throw it off 2 me but wateva These are my 1st retros and i plan on building my collection They are really nice i love the elephant print You should get these shoes

Color way is sick fit is just like the Cements that came out earlier this year nubuck is very soft Easy pick up too meaning Jordan fans dream release

I went a half size down 8 instead of 8 5 They fit perfect they leather is decent great shoe overall creasing is major unfortunately

These kicks are so unbelievebly fly that its like your walking on air Even the haters break their necks when they see these on my feet They fit great and look better Definitely a great pair for the collection Wearing these shoes gets your swag through the roof on 100 thousand 100 trillion levels Thank you based god for these Jays

I just got back into the shoe game this year I got the Retro 3true Blues and they are sick Look great and feel even better on my feet So I had to snatch up the Stealth I only regret not getting the Cement 3earlier this year

These are my first pair of jordans they are AMAZING just get ur normal size cuz they fit perfectly i wish i could give these shoes more than 5 stars btw my size is 10 5 but it did not let me put that for my size

The best shoe out there in the Jordan category At least one of the best ones The color scheme is awesome too Love them

great shoes

Jordan Brand has done it right for the most part in 2011 I was very impressed with the quality of this retro overall compared to the white cement colorway that released in January I passed on the white cement because of the quality but took a shot at the True Blues and they are great The leather on the upper is not too glossy and the fit is true to size I also love the retro box with the pamplet giving it an old school feel Looking forward to future releases

After purchasing my true blues I realized that there was a scratch mark on the blue portion of the shoe The insole was also not in place as it was popping up Therefore leading me to believe that the shoe was not constructed properly Therefore I had true blues

Love this ones Good quality shoe feels true to size and very comfortable

nice pair of kicks The air maxs and foamposites are better for playing ball but these are comfortable to walk in

Quality materials very little if any glue visible elephant print matched on both shoes Very comfortable to wear around the house and on the street very glad i was able to purchase direct thru NS

Great shoes great fit and comfortable I wore these to play basketball today and was very impressed considering they are 23 years old get them if you can

This shoe is one of the all time classic Air Jordans hard to go wrong with this one Comfort is great and these turn heads while out about If you have the means and the opportunity I highly recommend getting a pair You will not be disappointed in your purchase

The shoe looks good and feels good Plus i love shorts i hate pants so they look good with both yeah

i like the overall appearance of the shoe but the white cements are more comfortable to wear that the true blues and the tongue needs more padding but the shoe is a classic an icon

I think every one should have a pair I have one to ball in and one to put up for later life i have every color now jordan need to come back out with the old jordan 5s

Didnt think i was going to get them but wow amazingly i did they are so raw i love the whole style and comfort

i started collecting jordans since orions and yet these true blue air jordan 3s are a must have for all you sneaker heads do not miss out on these kicks because these are one of a kind

The sweetest of all JI like them so much I purchased two pairs one for the summer and one for whenever

First why does it say I bought a 1510 5 on Jan 22 for me Anyway Most Def on my top 5 Air Jordans of all time Nike deserves a standing ovation on quality and presentation Fit a little big so I down sized by half Supurb leather and excellent shape Good job JB try to keep with it

Out of my collection 3are my favorite The Shoe quality is better the leather feels more refined The tongue feels ok but it needs more padding Around the ankle the padding is ok as well JB needs to add more padding there as well The Elephant Print is alot better this time around The shoe fits nice and is comforatable The box is real nice I think JB needs to do this more often Also I wish JB would add the retro card with the shoe but the price would be higher All in all I am pretty happy with my purchase Looking forward to this year and the summers hot releases JB keep them coming

This is where the Jordan crazy began in my opinion the shoe that started it all The build quality and comfort of this shoe is only equaled by the Jordan 13 This was the shoe that made me really pay attention to the Jordan Brand when I was a kid Had to grab two pair one to wear and one for the collection I would highly recommend this shoe to all Jordan fans or Shoe aficianado SIZE 12 5 not 17

hands down the greatest jordan of all time remember am flew from the freethrow line in this shoe

I love this shoe To be honest I nought this shoe for the box Regardless of that this shoe is a classic and it looks good in my collection

Just got back from a midnight release at my local mall and was luckily to purchase four pairs of these sweet retro 3The texture leather and the comfort level is beyond words to explain The subtle design and the classic jumpman AIR logo on the heel is a sure bet you will turn heads whenever you wear these sweet kicks A little pricey but well worth your hard earned dollars and you never knjow when will they are release these again especially with the elephant print designs on them I can not wait for them to are release the blue color versions of these I am sure going to cop them as well

Have been sitting at the computer since 10 30 were available at 11 my time happy i made this purchase 1 of my favorite Js

First off this has always been an awesome shoe Had them in 88 and all the retrothat followed Only issue I have is the overview of the shoe MJ did not wear these for his 1st Slam dunk victory he wore the AJ2 MJ wore these for his last victory in 88 in Chicago 1st slam dunk win was 87 in Seattle Buff up Nike and Jordan Brand and bring back NIKE AIR on back of AJs



Straight out of the box comfortable Got the all black Stanreally an awesome shoe Loved them since I was a kid

These are my 1st pair of Stan Smiths and I am happy with my purchase It is a very comfortable sneaker to walk in and that old school classic look is a plus You can rock these sneakers with anything and it will look good

Classic Stan Smith that I always wanted but never got around to buying Strictly for casual use Great look with jeans Must have for anysneakerhead

These shoes are one of my all time favorites They are great with jeans or shorts

I bought this shoe for a bunch of reasons Those included look style and design Also I bought my wife a matching pair Plus we have the jackets to match these All in all a great purchase and a great shoe

Could go with any jeans or shorts you have in the closet Fits perfectly

good quality leather comfortable especially for people with slightly wider feet

They are comfy just hard to wear at times Nonetheless an amazing and comfy shoe with killer style

great shoes nice fit nice quality i will recommend it

This is my second pair and for good reason Very comfortable and stylish Had several comments as usual Fit size chart pretty much spot on They are cool and love them Old school looks

I bought these for a friend and he loved them He has not taken them off since

I ordered the shoes on a Thursday and the shoes came on Saturday they came really early than what I expected They are really comfortable and when I am seen with them on everyone wants to know where I got them or were they customized I love the shoes Nice casual look

I bought these for my son whoin high school and he loves them They look good on his feet They are slightly big because the size i bought these may run big however he will grow into them He wears them all the time and said they are comfortable

I bought this for my brother He likes this style and color BTW stan smithnew color is pure white The shoes run a little bigger than the size chart like 2 cm One thing not like is no shoe supporting materials in the shoes Shoes look a little bit squeezed All in all good purchase

what i like about this shoes is very comfortable and elegant

Had to cop these as I got them less them half off shipping which is an amazing deal I recommend a half size down if you are wondering about sizing a lot bigger than I expected and I have a wide foot The box I received these in was DESTROYED with actual scuffs and scrapes to the final shoe If I had paid retail I would have returned but alas you get what you pay for

I had a pair of these back in the 90s so I guess this was a nostalgia purchase They are still the same a bit stiff at the start but they last forever Very stylish but not an athletic shoe

My brother in law will only wear this shoe and has worn it for over 30 years The Stan Smith Adidas is my go to gift when I buy him birthday and Christmas gifts This makes it so convenient and easy for me Finishline is by far the best place to get this shoe Other added bonuses are the free shipping and winners circle rewards

A Great Timeless Classic that I hope Adidas never stops producing

A classic of a shoe The quality of the leather is on point Very iconic shoe as well

Great shoe for a great price The OG Stan Smithlooks great with anything from jeans to shorts Also Finish Line had them for the price I was looking for

Great all around shoe and you can not beat the classic all white look

As good as expected and nothing to complain about

Perfect shoes for me Its comfortable and i love the style

I grew up wearing Stan Smithand I LOVE them I am usually a Women6 5 7 As far as sizing the first pair I ordered was a Womensize 7 They arrive before they said they would but unfortunately they were way way too big I remembered that I used to by youths I returned the sneakers which was easy and completely hassle free The only small note is that I could not change size from a womento a youths online for an exchange Not a big deal I simply placed a new order for a youth size 5 5 They fit great and were 10 less I would have bought them if they were 10 more The second pair arrived super fast So happy with Adidas Well done and thank you for still making the original Stan Smithmy favorite sneaks of all time A classic

I played 4 wall wood floor handball for over 40 years and I found that the Stan Smith sole held the floor better than anything else I tried I was sad when you discontinued them but I am very glad you brought them back

Cr and s my toes and is painful Next size larger is way too big everywhere else

Adequate use of green to give the shoe a refreshing touch while keeping it simple

Fit in great with any number of looks Wore these with skinny jeans linen sport coat and blackshirt in Paris Verdict from a ParisianParfait 

Super cool classic sneakers Look amazing with different variety of clothes

it is easy going very simple and really nice love the navy color

been wearing Stans forever Very durable great fit Classic all round

I owned my first pair of Stan Smiths in the 70 and have wanted to get a new pair for a while definitely worth the wait and was not disappointed just as I remembered them very comfortable and stylish When I first got them I was playing a lot of tennis and now I am just wearing them for looks but who knows I may get back in the court with them soon

My Dad wore these shoes his entire life He recently died and I was thinking about how for 50 years I never saw my dad wear any sneaker tennis shoe but the Green Stan Smiths I did not even know that what they were called I just called them DadAdidasSadly towards the end of his life he had to cut holes in the sides to out of the sides because his arches fell Still he loved your shoes till the day he died and it gave me great memories Thanks for that

Stan smith are classic and the red is really nice The shoe fits well but the overall quality is not great The material creases immediately and it looks really cheap Pretty much on par for what I expected

Far from true to size a mission to return now

I am sorry to ever say anything negative but I always wear a size 7 that I ordered and after I took off the Tags I noticed how Large they were I think they were Mis Sized Thank you

Classic but modern style They definitely stand out

Because it is comfortable versatile and fit in every occasions

I can match this shoe with a lot of clothes And for the price it worth it

Need to go 2 sizes down Overall nice and stylish shoes

Love this shoe Very comfy and goes with all my outfits

Great value great comfort stylish Great value great comfort stylish

Great summertime shoe and casual look with a comfortable fit

I like it because it looks clean and simple at an affordable price

The classic ensures I love the new colors but went with the subtle white with blue trim

Absolutly amazing best quality and it fit perfectly

Beyond comfortable and stylish I love wearing them out

No need to break these guys in fit was perfect from the first time I put them on

The product is great thanks and will find more as time goes by

Classic look Very clean Well designed Love the Stan SmithI have been wearing them since the 80 

I like this because it is very comfortable and nice

it is a great looking classic shoe can not go wrong with Stan Smiths

I have had a few of Stan Smiths in the past and they never fail to do me justice Just a great comfortable shoe that you can dress up or dress down They do run a 1 2 size big in my opinion Normally I am a 10 5 in my ultra boost and Iniki runs but I went with a 10 here and they are perfect

Great quality such a great fit and they shoes match the images well

Sharp comfortable shoes with sweatpants jeans or khakis Love them

The product feels very comfortable besides the fact that I love the brand

I usually wear a EU 40 in Adidas However the EU 40 in the Stan Smith was a little too large for me so I went down to the EU 39 5 and the fit was much better If you have wide feet I think you will find these shoes to your liking and comfortable Enjoy

leather uppers are stiff compared to my older pairs but still a nice pair of shoes

One can not ask for better

Have ben wearing Stan Smiths for over 45 years and plan to wear them for many years to come

Looks great and goes well with everything It arrived sooner than I expected

I like the shoe because of the good leather on them

Good quality and accurate size These shoes are alittle expensive though

classic white sneaker shoes and comfortable and fit well

Comfortable and stylish Love these shoes have several pairs already

Really like the look of the shoe however they do run a little bigger

The shoes is so cool but you should get a smaller size than what you usually wear

Make this available in WIDE SIZES Improve quality

I love the Stan Smith shoe it is classy and comfortable

Well when I put on they wear hurting my right foot but fit my left ok I put the stretcher to it and they felt better What is hurting me right tors now is they did not see the younger at the very bottom well already worn them my lose

This product produced in China was able to duplicate the original

A sophisticated and stylish shoe for any occasion Made with great quality and comfort

Shoes fit perfect and are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Great material Great fit I see why you have kept this shoe exactly how it has always been Thanks Adidas

Standing in them for a long period of time can really start to hurt but other then that after wearing them for a whole week straight they still look clean cans are holding up very well and that is what I think counts

Comfy good looking shoes I love white shoes overall and have had a few adidas

I already had a pair so this will be ready when my old pair wears out

The Stan Smith is one of the best Adidas models of all time so I had to get a pair sooner or later Now that I own them I love them even more they are not the most comfortable shoe but they are not uncomfortable and they just look so good with everything Definitely a purchase I will not regret

Great fit and Classic Style that looks great in many situations

I love this product because it is almost the perfect shoe for me The only thing lacking is that the sole is too thin

Love the Shoes I do not appreciate getting a pair from some store in NY that I thought i was ordering from warehouse that were previously worn I sent them back

Very comfortable shoe Great style for every occasion

Blatantly false advertising by Adidas They want you to believe it is real full grain leather like they used to make them Really nothing more than cheap synthetic leatherette sourced directly from China Big disappointment

I love them Look sharp and comfortable Quality leather

I am 58 years old and I just HATE the current stuff found in stores To me sneakerrs should be mostly white they should be leather and they should look good in an understated way not flashy Stan Smithnever disappoint I can never find them in stores and settle for something else why of why have I not bought WHAT I LIKE onlineI love these classic beauties even my daughters 33 year old boyfriend liked them

The shoe was a perfect fit and very comfortable I took it on a trip and had zero complaints going through the airports site seeing or even going out and about at night

Looks and fits perfectly I especially love they way they look with jeans and chino pants

Great product Have enjoyed for over 30 years

These shoes are super stylish and I live how retro they look

It goes with every outfit that I wear I love these shoes

These shoes are so versatile They can be dressed up or worn casually Love them

These are great shoes so stylish and comfortable

I really like the Rod laver design better then the oneI purchased They are comfortable no very close in design to the Laver shoe

These shoes are comfortable and stylish The all black makes them interchangeable with a lot of outfits

They are stan smiths what are there to say Just love them

I have looked long and hard for comfortable stylish non running shoes These are perfect

These are some nice looking shoes Sizing is a little off A 9 5 is the right length but a little too narrow and a 10 is the right width but a tad too long Other than that I love the shoes

I love the shoes I ordered so comfortable and oerfect size

I have worn Stan Smith sneakers continuously since 1972

Nice shoes I would not play tennis in them but that is not why I got them

love it now will love it always look forward to getting other colors

These shoes are so versatile and go with so many different outfits Make sure you get a half size bigger than what you normally wear however I followed that advice from the reviews and it worked out great

really enjoyed the purchase and will definitely buy another pair

This is at least the 5th time i have purchased these Stan Smith shoes in black It seems Adidas has upgraded the leather on these shoes The material feels softer and smoother The fit is fantastic and there was no break in time needed

Shoes are Way Too big for me to wear on my feet

They look good but need arch support I love these shoes and always have but same issue

These shoes are amazing and go with any outfit It took me a few wears to break them because of their stiffness I would definitely recommend getting half a size smaller than normal as other reviewers have said

liked the navy blue back of shoe

I read to size down 1 2 size so I did and they fit perfectly

I originally owned these as a kid decades ago and these are just as I remembered

Comfortable shoe for a reasonable price reccomend

I have size 16 feet and over the years Adidas has had a few options I loved the Rod Lavers when they were available and now I am loving the Stan Smiths Please keep us bigfooted people in mind when you order your runs Thanks so much

I have been buying this shoe for decades They have always been consistent in quality and comfort

A true classic tennis show with iconic look and feel of the original shoe developed by Stan Smith

These shoes pair perfectly with a casual outfit but can also be dressed up they are super comfortable and I love their look

After switching from the original white with green trim to triple white I have always stayed there I went to buy another pair and there was no triple white to be found Opted for triple black and I am happy with the choice I think I will still get a triple white if it ever becomes available again Aqq

Love the sneakers my favorite for many years still great quality

Was looking for a nice pair of classic white sneakers I was pleased to see these had the ortholite sockliners in them so I decided to go and am very happy They are comfortable and great looking

This shoe is very comfortable and relevant in currentstyles Great shoe

Easy to throw on and goes with everything Perfect for everyday wear

I like them They feel great on my feet I like the green adidas logo

With its simple design and great style this shoe can easily be anyonefavorite This is my third pair of Stan Smiths and I love its affordability and also how it feels on the feet The sneaker is very versatile with a variety of styles and so it adds to my wardrobe Whenever these go I am planning on getting my fourth pair Would highly recommend to those who have not owned a pair before

I love the material is very comfortable and it is good to use every day

Love this version in all black of Stan Smith as it allows me to wear shoes I can do a lot of walking innduring the work day Living and working in Beverly Hills it is a walk around town Stan Smith always garners compliments even from my most fashion forward friends Please continue making these great shoes in all black

Love these shoes They fit great look wonderful and are very comfortable

The quality seems to be excellent However these shoes are simply too narrow Unfortunately the buyer has no option to select a width when purchasing I assume all lengths are the same basic width I exchanged the first pair for a half size larger but they are still the same narrow width I intended to buy the same shoe in white but I have already taken care of that via another brand

I love this shoe so much and I get so many compliments It is very stylish but ORDER A HALF SIZE SMALLER So they fit good mine is just a tad to big

The women sizes were all out so I bought the men size equivalent Shoes were shipped extremely fast no complaints there My girlfriend put them on and said everything was perfect Extremely satisfied with the purchase

I like them so much Thai I never kick them off untying them befor pulling them off my feet I respect the product

Very stylish and good quality shoes They do run large so order 1 2 to one size down

Best all around shoe I have ever owned Fifth pair I have owned

Because it is the most comfortable make i have ever seen

Fit is perfect Great for tennis or everyday wear

Simple without frills Fit is a bit wide There is no removable insole

Great Shoe at a great price with quick delivery

I love Stan Smiths I have slight wide foot so many shoes I have to size up half size or full size I went true to size and do not regret it Although is slightly snug on the sides it does not produce discomfort Length wise is perfect Highly recommend

Jus overall classic shoes Goes with everything and you are going to look fresh without having to try hard

Can wear everyday with any wardrobe Always in style

The shoes are classic I had a pair in high school and I just kept buying them for 30 years

Very stylish and very sleek as well as being incredibly comfortable

Reliable dependable good looking and comfortable

Are you kidding meStan Smiths need no description they are the past present and future of what it means to perfect the shoe

First things first they are classics that are relatively affordable Secondly they go with any outfit Finally they are very comfortable Only thing I would love to see from Adidas is an affordable boost version of the shoe

I like the way the shoe feels and looks Been wanting to buy me a pair for awhile

Exactly as it is always been Classic white sneaker with endless versatility Be ordering another pair soon

My shoe in black is an accurately sized and well made tennis shoe that can be worn with casual slacks jeans and of course shorts Well done Adidas

Classic style that goes with a lot of stuff Stan smiths never go out of style Quality leather I usually wear a 10 5 and that is what I bought but they run big bc I have more room at the front than normal 10 5 with Adidas Overall I love them though

the quality good as I expected the size was a bit bigger than I thought

These kicks are sexy bro My life has changed with them

Bought these for my son and he loved them and this classic look is timeless

These are my 4th pair and I love them so much I love the color and if you take good care of them they stay nice and white

I have had the shoes for two weeks now and i must say they fit really well and go with just about every outfit Will probably but these again at some point

They are wonderfully I loved red is a classic sport style on the world they are perfect

One of the greatest shoe ever Runs a size big my UB are a size 8 and went to a 7 in the Stans Comfort day after day Hardest test I put the shoes through was a week in NYC walking more than 50mi across 4 5 days Never felt discomfort during the trip

Stan Smith adidas or very reliable and durable I plan on buying more

I have bought a dozen like this over a few yearsworks perfectly for me

Well constructed for crappy environments I use them in

I usually wear a women 9 5 and i ordered an 8 5 in this show because of the change in sizing It may be a little big but it is too late for me to switch to a smaller size since I have already worn them once Will still work though

The shoes are a great style and quality They fit true to size

TOO BIG Had to order half a size smaller than my size

I like them because I like pharell and pharell likes me

Classic classy cool comfortable kicks Look sweet and comfortable enough to walk for miles in

I like the product because it is a nice leather shoe and matches well with everything

Nothing glamorous comes from this shoe but that is not what you buy stan smiths for I bought these for the simplicity and the silhouette both of which satisfies what I am looking for in a sneaker

Pairs well with many outfits White Red is a dope combo

Great shoes comfortable and nice to wear to casual outings

I think the shoe is a classic but I do not really think this shoe is the best quality product they offer

I wear a 12 Wide I did not see an option for a width So far they are not uncomfortable Are they supposed to stretch

Good product i like it so much I already had two other pair but different colors i love them

This was the perfect gift for our son so much so that I had to are order a pair for dad

The silhouette is classic and amazing The shoe also ages well

great design very happy with delivery and product quality

Love the quality and comfort of Adidas these check all the boxes style included

I really like the shoes They look great and are super comfortable

Make sure you go a half or full size down I did not listen to other reviews and here I am returning them These are great shoes though

I had a pair when I was younger but they stopped making them When I heard they were back I was really excited My wife bought them for me as a Christmas gift

Classic and stylish look Very comfortable Very satisfied with purchase

Because it was delivered b4 Xmas and my son loved it

Forget every other brand

i like this product because the shoes are very comfortable and they are very nice looking

My favorite pair of shoes for every occasion I rotate them out from daily wear to gardening shoes when they get worn down then I buy another of the same pair and repeat the cycle I have also gotten family members to get on the Stan Smiths train Love these shoes

I have been wearing this shoe both on the court and off since the 1980It is simply the best and best looking tennis show on the market

Awesome footwear Cut is a bit large Go 1 2 size down

Love the old school look Goes great with jeans or chinos

Was beating around the bush on these for a minute but I saw a guy on the A train with them and seeing them IRL had me sold I love my Stans looking great comfort for days

Ultra comfortable and just so cool Love my Stans and got so many compliments immediately

The fit is right on and comfort is better than expected

Love the look and fit of this shoe Would recommend

It was exactly as expected Great quality and nice looking

The fit with a lot of outfits good quality and they are beatiful

Awesome old school Adidas They are as comfortable as I remember

adidas tried and true great shipping beautiful shoe happy husband

Perfect to dress up or dress down casual Classic shoe perfect for all occasions

Its perfect i like the qualyti everithing Its more than i expected

he is picky and does his research the feel and comfort of the shoe is why he wanted them

Love the classic style they are very very white however

Decided to buy these over the Continental 80s for my sonone pair of white sneaker It is hard to resist their perfect style

it is pretty nice amd very confortable I like to use them daily

Owned a pair of these in the 80s and they are still great

So far so good First time purchase on this product and store

First pair only lasted 34 years Will try and be more careful with this pair

The quality is great and the green trim is a perfect addition to my collection

Comfortable to wear Great purchase Getting another one next year

These look super cool Was on the fence about buying these and decided to jump the gun Was not disappointed

I love these in comparison to the superstars Great overall shoe and love the green

There are certain wardrobe staples that should be in every man closet a double or single breasted navy blazer well fitting faded jeans a tuxedo and a pair of Stan Smith sneakers a true classic

Amazing shoes classic fit and match with everything you wear

I love Stan Smith for its simple design and smooth clean look This goes with both athletic and even with semi drsss up with hint of relaxed touch

After admiring these on other women of all ages for years I finally decided to take the plunge And I am so glad I did These are the perfect shoe Not only are they timeless and comfortable but they go with everything in my wardrobe from joggers and jeans to pencil skirts and sundresses could not be happier and now wondered why it took me so long FYI they do run largeit took 2 attempts to nail the right size

Simple classic and comfortable you all love them

I have worn Rod Lavers for 25 years and I am sad you are not making them anymore but these will make an excellent replacement Thank you for always making such comfortable and stylish shoes for DECADES

Great for jeans joggers however I had to take the lace out and put it back in because the shoe was a little too wide on the sida

I love these shoes because they are very comfortable to wear go with a lot of choices of style and can be personalized

it is a classic and it lasts good value as well clean

It has been only 3 weeks but one of the shoes painting is chipping out already Poor quality

This is my second time buying a pair of these shoes and that is because they are comfortable and goood looking

This shoe is comfortable and looks good with just about anything

awesome shoe would buy again delivered right on time

Cause I had a Stan Smith 11 1 2 inch earlier but it is way narrower compared to that

The Stan Smith Sneaker is the most comfortable I ever owned It holds my foot in just the right proportion of balance and comfort for hours and hours of wear This sneaker type actually allows me to perform longer and better I do a lot of physical activity on a daily basis and nothing offers more comfort and support I am a Stan Smith Adidas customer for life Thank you

I highly recommend this shoe It fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable Goes with just about any outfit

One of the best pair of shoes I have bought and there so comfortable

Classic Have loved them forever How can you not

I guess it is a thing with shoe sizes Other than that I love them

Love these shoes and will have forever Need a little breaking in to get leather to loosen up but perfect after a couple of wears

It goes great with everything I wear and it is easy to keep clean

the perfect shoe to dress up or dress down withfor any outfit

The Sam Smith sneakers were a great match with my outfits

My fave shoe that can match almost any outfit You gotta have a pair of these

Super versatile and comfortable shoes Now I just have to keep them clean

Very versatile shoe goes pretty much with everything

the product is very good I fulfill all my expectations

Stan smith are classic and are well made to feel so comfortable Plus they look great oo

This is a shoe every guy should have in his closet Only gripe is I have a wide foot so the front sides started to crease after only a couple of wears however the shoe is quite roomy already so I would not recommend going a size up even if you have a wide foot Asides from that this is a very comfortable good looking shoe that can be paired with so many different outfit styles Buy it

Outstanding Outstanding Outstanding Outstanding

The feel of the shoes is incredible the way they look and feel on my feet is great

Since my feet a bit wider than normal I was afraid that the shoes would be too narrow However the shoes fit me very well providing breathability without feeling like my foot is being crushed

These shoes are absolute heat and have been for many decades and many decades to come One of the many timeless piece that will always be relevant by Adidas Originals

Love these shoes especially with the green her tab Such a classic shoe Can never go wrong with a pair of Stan Smiths I would love to work for adidas I am in school at ODU I am Norfolk VA for Fashion Merchandising How can I get an internship in the Adidas headquarters

Overall I like the classic silhouette of the sneaker However it seems as though the leather is very cheap After just one normal wear there was a deep scuff in the left toe box that will not come out as it is too deep Also the plastic leather creases immediately upon wear As for comfort I would say they are pretty good I definitely start to notice they are on my feet after a full day of wear but no discomfort whatsoever if I am only wearing them for a short amount of time For fit I wear a 10 in ultraboost and opted for a 9 in these While they fit with the amount a thumbs width of extra space in the toe box I think that an 8 5 US would fit even better If I decide to get another pair once these wear out it should not be very long before that happens I might try another half size down because I like a snug fit with no slipping in the heel Despite the quality concerns of this shoe I am glad I bought it and it is true that they look even better with a little grit and age to themtruly an iconic sneaker

Great classics it is sad that they are mainstream now to basics that have no idea of the brand

The first time I bought them a very long time ago in Europe Even after a few years they looked great Finally I wanted to buy another one but still that model After 6 months they looked worse than the previous ones I did not want to give negative feedback too hastily so I bought them the third time And again poor quality Deep wrinkles appeared very quickly they tend to gain very visible abrasions what proves the shoes are made from low quality leather They are not as good as they used to be I also noticed in Europe the shoes were Made in Philippines and in US we have Made in China So dissapointed

these shoes are by fare the most comfortable shoes i own i can wear these shoes all day with no problems simple yet classy with comfort

I have pair of the gazelles and wanted to try something new so went for the stan smiths They are everything i hoped for and more if you are looking for a new pair of everyday shoes then i would highly recommend these the only thing is that they are about a 1 2 size big

These shoes are great for everyday use They really hold their shape and are still comfortable even after a year of daily use

It was exactly what I expected and what I wanted Shipment was flaw

True to size and comfortable I have been wearing them every day since I got them I get compliments on them all the time The perforation on the sides does not go all the way through which is nice so it helps keep your feet dry

Awesome product I will buy more adidas product comfortable shoe

Wish white was not such a hard color to maintain though

Need to size down but other than that they are great

Great Price easily match with any outfit Not great for walking all day

Both two shoes I bought he really likes it

They are a great style and perfect fit goes well with my outfit

I am team Adidas when it comes to sneakers but this wins the trophy for WORST comfort and support My ankle hurts every time I wore it so I trashed it

This product can be worn with virtually anything Extremely comfortablewore them on vacation and walked 5 7 miles daily with them and my feet never hurt

It is very perfect you will love the Stan Smith Thx adidas

Very happy with purchase but have not had them long enough to give them 5 stars At this time I would give them a 4 5 rating if I could Will try to update this review in 6 months my normal size shoe is between 10 and 10 5 Because reviews indicate that these shoes tended to be a bit on the large size I ordered a size 10 despite the fact that my feet are on the wide side Glad I did since 10 5 would have been too large

Have worn and loved the Stan Smith shoe in the past but somehow I am now between sizes 9 5 too small 100 too big Sad because I realy love the style

I have been wearing these for years and could purchase them locally at will Now they are a seasonal item in a city of almost 2M people The shoes are now narrower at the toes I could have found this out if I was able to try them on in person Addidas management web developers and marketing staff are incompetent

Comfortable and nice The longer I have been wearing them the more it is getting soft and comfortable because it is leatherette nice

My sister had gotten superstars just before me and I tried them on to get a reference as to which shoe size I wanted However her shoes had cloudfoam memory foam so when I received my shoes they were about one size too big

No other sneaker compares Been rocking these since 19

it is comfortable and fantastic I recommend it to all adidas lovers

I love these cause you can dress them up and dress them down Hands down my fave sneakers

Classic style and it suites my taste and thats all

Size quality all good Can ask for more Like them very much

Great product The absolute gold standard for leather white sneakers Fits a bit large

Great everything thing I wear them with suit chinos jeans and shorts You should keep these in your closet

I wear a size 8 in women and brought a 6 in men They fit perfectly except the sides are narrow and rubs against my feet when I walk Maybe I need to break them in some more

Overall they are good 

I really recommend the Stan smith editions Maximum quality and durability they also ad a vintage touch to your look

Im a 7 1 2 I ordered the 7 it was too big I prob needed a 6 I returned it

Have worn Stan Smiths for over 40 years Love them

I have been needing to get new shoes as my current shoes were not the best for walking these are better on my feet than my last pair

This is the first time I have bought this classic shoe and it did not disappoint The silhouette is clean the leather is a pretty good quality One thing though is this shoe runs really small at least for me I originally bought a 9 5 cause that is my size for NMDs but it was way too big Had to return it for 8 5 but that is still too big I could honestly wear a 8 or maybe even 7 5 Definitely try this shoe on before purchasing

I wore these back in the 80s and putting them on made me feel I was transported back the style the feel and the quality Adidas is the best

Love these Shoes A great shoe for a very reasonable price with the Quality you expect from Adidas

Superior quality and styling Very pleased Ordering another pair

This is the only shoe that fits me perfectly I would recommend it is a timeless classic You can not go wrong

Aunt loves them to wear to work and out with her friends she gets compliments all the time

These are fine shoes and demonstrate superb quality

Shoe can be dressed up or down Very comfortable stylish great materials

I had several pairs of these many years ago and liked the idea of the cult following But the sole liner was so thin the shoes are uncomfortable and i had to my some Dr Schollliners to make them more comfortable I think the size 10 1 2 is correct but they feel tight and just are not pleasant to wear Maybe after they loosen up they will be better

i had those shoes when i was a teen and i love them

Stan smith shoes look clean but that is the only positive I have found The shoe feels cheaply made and I am not sure its going to hold up to normal wear The stripes in this case the punched ventilation holes were not completely punched out on one side of the right shoe I wear a 10 1 2 but after reading that the shoe runs large I ordered a size 10 and it is still a 1 2 size to large If you are on your feet for an extended period of time these shoes are less than comfortable

I am a woman with a wide foot I usually wear a size 9 in womenshoes I ordered these in a mensize 7 and they fit perfectly since menshoes are generally wider Love them and with the red trim I get compliments every time I wear them

These shoes do not advertise it but they have a special orthotic sole which helps to support your arch I have a small arch so my feet really appreciate the love thanks Adidas

Once the shoes came they were not at all what I expected they were bulky in an unflattering way and there were odd pressure points that made my feet hurt it is sad because I was looking forward to wearing these

My first but not last pair of Stan Smiths These are unique with the Velcro super crispy

These shoes are amazing i am gonna be still shopping ever

This shoe is extremely comfortable and stylish It is a classic shoe that can be dressed up or down

Best shoes ever Took me 4 months to find them again Wish I could afford to buy all colors avail Incase they go out of stock can not find in any store Please do not discontinue or change anything This shoe is perfect for work or play

I live in these everyday at work and play and have for years I wish they were still discounted at the employee store as they were in the past

Product is a staple in my wardrobe Issue I have was the shoes labeled size 10 5 were incorrect The left shouted is smaller in size and was manufactured and shipped incorrectly Shoes were returned

can not go wrong with a classic shoes Perfect fit

Great shoes pretty much sums it up Goes with a lot of outfits and is classic because of that minimalistic style I would recommend these to anyone

I will be wearing stands minutes till the day I die

Great shoes Had to get half a size smaller because they run a bit large

Classic style and great quality Stan Smith in classic green is always the right way to go

I like the product and I recommend it to my friends

Love the retro Had a pair 45 years ago I find these shoes run large Get the next size down Although love the look the do not offer much support

classic fashionable shoe I have not black and white ones very durable after a year they start showing cracking in the material but I am very please with them can not go wring with a sun smith def have a pair in your wardrobe

Stan smiths are an icon shoe that can match with just about everything I really recommend this shoe as it has a leather upper and is very comfortable 10 10 would purchase more

These were the popular thing to wear in my high school years

Great Comfortable and Stylish Shoes My son is planning on wearing the shoes with a black slim dress pants black jacket and white shirt

Great shoe A clean and versatile shoe for almost any occasion it is not THE most comfortable shoe but definitely no wear near the worst

Great look and feel but runs a bit narrow

I have worn this shoes for 3 years nearly everyday

Love Adidas because they are ageless Quality is always great You might want to size because they run about one size large

I like the product mainly for the style but the shoe is perfect all around

This is my 3rd pair of Stan Smiths The first 2 pairs have been incredibly comfortable These hurt my feet so much I can no longer wear them Very disappointed

I love adidas Stan smith is one of the best shoes forever

I bought my second pair of Stan Smiths and I am always coming back to them They are simple and easy to wear plus very comfortable

Love this vintage look that transcends the ages Still a staple that goes with everything The best

Its Very comfortable shoe and i can use it for every ocassion

I love Stan Smiths you really can not go wrong with this classic shoe I will recommend wearing band aids on your heels while breaking them in because I got a horrible blister and now I can only wear sandals for a while

The shoes are classic Great silhouette Leather is nicebut the stitching is not as durable as I would expect from such a renowned shoe Ive had these just for just three weeksand already see picture

Shoe felt a bit narrow at the store but the break in was quick and painless I was surprise how comfortable they are Wore them to work on casual Friday with dark jeans polo and got several compliments Same weekend with some shorts and a neck and again got some compliments Very versatile sneaker I hope they last Thanks

I like this product because they look Sharp with everything i wear

I imagined that the material would be leather for the top

I like them because I can wear these anywhere These shoes are very nice

They are just like I remember them from the early 80 

White always looks great Fit is good Would definitely recommend everyone to own a pair of these

Love these shoes I do not know why everyone is saying they do not fit true to size mine fit as perfect as any other shoe in my size Simple and will go with anything you are wearing

Classic cool white sneaker Comfortable and can wear dressy or casual

This shoe is a classic and works with all outfits on anybody The shoe comes a whole to a half size large so I would really recommend sizing down I am a Nike size 9 5 and I know they run small So I ordered a 10 in these shoes They are too large for me and now I am going to order a size 9 so do not make the same mistake But the quality of the shoe is amazing and it looks amazing Over all I highly recommend it

i love the look and style of the shoe and it matches outfits easily do not like how the leather creases so easily but it is fine and easy to wipe when dirt gets on it runs REALLY big usually between a size 6 5 7 and had to get a 5 5 in this when I bought i was worried about comfort but it only took a couple days for the shoe to break in has lots of padding

Love these classic shoes I am a woman and usually wear a women US 7 5 but wear a women 6 5 in other adidas styles like the Gazelle and the men size 5 fit me perfectly So glad I was able to snag a pair of these in the white navy combo as they have been hard to find

i got these shoes about a year ago and i have worn them almost everyday since i have very high arches and the soles have great support everything about the shoes are comfortable and i have never gotten a blister from them although when walking around the tongue of the shoes goes off to the outside which is weird and annoying also the white has chipped off significantly all over the shoe keep in mind they are roughly worn and I have had them for a while but that started happening a while ago

look great with jeans

Like a lot of reviews on here the shoes do run a tad bigger I have wider feet so the size difference did not matter They fit perfectly without squeezing my toes and are incredibly comfortable If you do not have wide feet maybe consider going down a half size

I have been wearing Stan Smiths for over twenty years and they are fantastic A true classic that can be dressed up or down They break in nicely after only a couple of wears and will probably become the most comfortable lifestyle trainers you own They run about a half size larger than adidas Superstars so keep that in mind when ordering

Love the look of the shoe and it is very comfortable A hole formed in the bottom of the sole and it made them unwearable because it spread very quickly

Very comfortable and durable I would recommend this shoe to anyone

Wore them for years glad Adidas brought them back

They are a Classic tennis shoes like how comfortable are love in green color I use them since I was in High School

Stan Smith Shoes is really comfortable I wear it with jeans or suits

Dope classic shoe and I also love the classic all white shoe with just a dab of green Great shoe

I can wear then in both informal and formal settings

This is my 12th pair of Stan Smith shoes and they are so comfortable and old SchoolJust love them

These are the only tennis shoes my husband wears Has been wearing them for at least 30 years he even bought them for our 6 and 3 year old grandsons However it is getting harder to find them seems like they are always sold out

Love it Some things never change Same style in the 80

I originally wore the Adidas Stan Smith for playing tennis when I was a young man Now I wear them as a boat shoe and every day casual shoe They are comfortable out of the box they have a great gripping sole and they are durable

it is a great product to match with any type of pants

If you have not gotten these you should I am debating on getting them in another color

Like these shoes nice look comfortable and elegant can match a weekend barbeque party or an elegant dress with an alternative touch

Very good looking Great design Not very comfortable though

Always perfect quality and of course the brand name make you feel good wearing them

Classic shoes is always one of the best style

Great shoe Timeless design very comfortable to do every day tasks in

The best dress sneakers ever recommend to every one

I have been waring the same model for 45 years I like them and the quality has been consistent Access has improved with internet sales

Nice and stylish but mine in particular came with the tip deformed they are not completely round as if there was a problem in the production

I would like to say that I was recently in Paris and I found their selection much more interesting and extensive The options in NYC were very limited

Great purchase quick arrival perfect size perfect

You never slip Best gripping tennis shoe of all time

I have allways liked the size fit and feel of addidas brand shoes

Comfortable nice looking shoe fit perfect every time

Had this shoes 20 years ago Decided to get one again This model do not go out of style

They look good with everything very classy stylish and sophisticated

Great shoes Normally a size 12 but these in 11 5 are perfect

I went with a half size smaller than what I usually get 8 5M and found that they were too narrow though I have still worn them for almost a year now The length is fine but the shoe looks too small on me and my foot falls off the inside edge Somehow they are still comfortable to wear though Will be trying my true size 9M and adding some wearable shoetrees to make the toebox smaller

Great price for the all white parties so fresh so clean for the summer

I ordered a size 14 These were very narrow but they do look nice

The shoe is a classic beauty and super comfortable The more you wear them the better it fitswalking around NYC all day in them did not hurt my feet or back The white is superb and they look great with anything you wear They do run a little big I highly recommend the shoe

Classic Stan Smiths in all black go with everything and great quality from Adidas as always

Coz these are one of the most comfortable shoes I have owned and they go great with all casuals

Very fast shipping

I love the sneaker I prefer the show in navy I purchased the sneaker for my son graduation

Size is not as the same size for super star that i am always buying

My type of sneaker super clean but flat Add socks to the shoe bundle would be dope

Great looking comfortable shoes Ordered exact size

the best sneaker in my life Cool design and comfortable

My kids love the kicks my hubby and I wore back in the day

Please keep the product in stock I need a size 10 for my son in the white blue

I wanted to find a shoe to replace my Supras and these shoes fit the bill They fit pretty well though I would probably recommend getting them a size smaller than what you would normally wear

Great quality and it fits perfectly I would recommend to anyone

Nice shoes look fine and it is not too expensive You need it

Simple not too sporty not too classy Highly suggest

great quality prompt delivery satisfied customer

Classic Style Always Fresh Cop those jawns if you know what to do

I like them because they are water proof but I do not like white They get dirty to fast

Lower quality leather than original stan Still a great looking and comfortable shoe

I am normally a women9 and the men6 5 is the perfect size for me

I was very disappointed when i opened the box i do not like the way you guys packaged my shoes I will not order from here again because it did not have any tissue supporting paper inside whatsoever It seems to me that it looks like a returned product

They look to good with anything I sport

Classic shoes that pairs with almost all of jeans and pants

I would not say they are the worst shoes in the world they are far from it but there are some things I should mention to people considering buying the shoe The first is that they do sort of crease a lot for me at least Perhaps I just do not take as good care of them as others but it is definitely something you want to be weary of The first time I wore them out they squeaked a lot as well but that is really a minor issue have not heard anything since then In terms of size they fit rather large I ordered a 1 2 size lower than I usually do for other shoes but even then I find that they still fit loose on me They also seem to be rather comfy shoes so far I would not say they are as comfortable as something like an Ultra Boost but it is not like you are stepping on bricks either they are also very versatile as well wearing them with a good white polo shirt and khaki chinos looks great This review has become rather long but just one more point I promise As a rather skinny individual I feel like these do not look too great with shorts If you are a rather muscular person or at least have legs that do not really look like twigs they will look good on you I unfortunately have to wear them with pants almost exclusively or else they really emphasize the thinness of my legs

Always wanted these sneakers Love them Want to buy in more colors Gonna buy for daughter

The show is very comfortable but the material can be physically altered very easily

Fantastic and attractive shoe very comfortable and only getting better with wear I usually wear an 8 but had to get these in a 7 5

Stan Smith adidas what can I say about these just classic These can go with just about everything perfect fit classic look

Even thought they are white it is leather meaning it is more durable does not get dirty easily and can also be cleaned easily Yes they run big but just buy a full size smaller and you will be good to go Again leather so it will stretch a bit over time Overall very comfortable and can be worn with almost anything

They exceeded my expectations Great quality comfort and value

Great product Wished I would received a receipt with purchase

Uncomfortable shoe sole i needed a shoe i can walk in all day And this show would be great and looks very clean and elegant Unfortunately the shoe is not comfortable Also the tongue was very long It didnt sit well when the laces were done

My first pair of Adidas Originals in a long time and definitely a must have pair of sneakers to have in your wardrobe I like the overall minimalism the shoe has with the perforated three stripes and the all white upper with the colored heel tab and it looks better with age and wear in my honest opinion

They are stylish and comfortable my 16 yr old son absolutely loves them

The only issue I have with these is that they are a pain to maintain They get dirty very fast

First leather athletic shoes I have had in awhile Needs a short break in period for best comfort The leather has a strong smell that is slowly diminishing

The classic models run a half size larger I am size 10 and I had to order 9 1 2 for a good fit

I used to wear Stan Smithexclusively in the 70and 80I was so crushed when Adidas stopped making them I am happy again These are such comfortable and well made shoes I hope they will be a permanent item for Adidas again I am a female but purchased the menshoes as that is what I wore then Remember to get 1 1 2 sizes down from the womensizes I wear an 8 and ordered a 6 1 2

I like them because of classic lines simplicity and comfort The shoes are well sized Only complaint is the tongue is a tad long

I love these shoes Looks great in the all black color scheme If you have wide feet you will have to go up a half size This shoe will keep you comfortable even in all day use I highly recommend these shoes

Stan Smiths stand out as one of the best shoes Adidas has ever made I thoroughly enjoy the aesthetics and the comfort of the shoes The width is slightly narrow in the toe box but eventually it fits to your feet Stay true to size I purchased the navy blue accent instead of the classic green it is a great alternative

Great looking shoes But in my case I had to reorder in a 1 2 size smaller

Not only am I white but can look fly as heck wearin these shoes but they are comfy as all get out I wish I could wear them every day for the rest of my life

I love these shoes so much that my recent purchase was my second pair I had my first pair for about 8 months and wore them almost every day because they are so comfortable I love the green color because it compliments my wardrobe very well but I am sure the other colors are just as good there is a reason these shoes are so popular and it is because they have the comfort factor and the support every foot needs

My son has size 14 feet and I was thrilled to find something he liked that was in his size and we didnt have to go to a mall to find them

Shoes are very comfortable and wear great guess that is why I have owned about 10 pair over my 50 year life span

I have slightly wide feet and these fit tts I recommend trying them on first You can not get a better value for white leather shoes You can dress them up and dress them down easily Great product and it is no wonder why these are a classic

They arrived super fast and were exactly what I wanted

The shoes becomes oversized and wrinkly in a very small period of time i would not recommend as a daily wear as they get oversized and uncomfortable

Recommend shoe

I am usually size 7 for woman but I took size 5 5 for men

Really easy to crease from the sides also very narrow

In womenshoes I am normally a size around 8 depending on the brand So I got a 6 in mens for this shoe They rock I love them they fit just perfectly I def recommend them Also in the sunlight they kinda look dark navy blue but idk if they are supposed to be like that sorry if they say that they are and I was not paying attention But when not paying attention to they look black back of shoe Either way I love them

Saw these on Pinterest and liked them Ordered them and voila Just as expected They look amazing and are very comfortable even without sox Definite

A classic look that you cannot go wrong with The leather quality feels very good for its price point The shoe runs bit narrow but flexible at the heel Otherwise it is very comfortable

Chuck Taylor it is over Stan Smith is my new guy and he is fantastic Sorry not sorry

I like the product for how it looks and feels At first it left some space in the heel area but after breaking in the shoe that space has gone and they are really good every day shoes They fit good they are comfortable and stylish What more does a shoe need

I like them because of their vibrant color red and nice look

I really loved the style of this shoe and it is incredibly comfortable the only complaint I would have is how the leather creases after normal wear Not a major thing though

These were my first pair of Stan Smiths and I am so happy with my purchase They are really sleek and stylish looking I love that the three stripes are subtle air perforations Also a big fan of the smooth front instead of the ridges on some of the white options Definitely recommend these to everyone as a wardrobe staple

Perfect mix of comfort and style Formal or Informal goes with every look

As usual I know my size perfectly with Adidas I have been looking for a good pair of solid black shoes and these are perfect

Everything I expected the softness of the leather and the finish super cool

Classic shoe that should be in all rotations Bring the orange heel back

Classic shoe very comfortable I would size down

the only issue i had the size so order one size less than your actual size otherwise the quality is overall great

All black Stans are so versatilefinally an elegant edition to the Stan Smith line best used for casual night out

All good love them first pair in 25 years just like I remember

I just have one thing to sayIf your stan smith got old and cant be carried anymore buy another pair of and voil xc3 xa0 you got your score back

Amazing I love the look at the shoe in generally and i look so good

Hey Loving these shoes beautiful and fit near perfect despite being a TINY bit too narrow but wearing thin dress socks fixes that Great quality and very comfortable more so than most sneakers I have owned

My enjoyment of the shoe goes back to the originals when Stan Smith was playing tennis I like the simplicity and style of the shoe

The best all around shoe for me One minor flaw twice in the past several years a pair would have the top front left shoe wider than the right shoe This happened in this most recent purchase

The shoes are a comfortable daily wear and are priced fairly well

Good quality comfortable throwback to one of the shoes that made Adidas popular to begin with Love them

I absolutley love these shoes They just seen to be a little bit narrow at the toes part or I do not know If I wear them too long I get a blister on my little toe But they are still super cool and I still love them

A really great shoe feels comfy and very stylish

shoe arrived dirty with slight creasing and some signs that it was worn before

PLEASE NEVER EVER STOP MAKING THESE SHOES STAN SMITH MUST LIVE ON Such a good well rounded shoe I hope these live forever They are so comfy right out of the box and mix well with all outfits

Style look comfort one of the best made adidas wear

I really like how the shoe looks the heel comes up a bit high and needs longer socks

Shoes are attractive well made very comfortable and stand up well to the abuse of playing tennis

We need a larger size So I will need a return Can you please send me return instructions Thank you

Great Product and they fit well and look very nice Would definitely recommend these shoes

Best price and the quality is great and i will tell your company to my frieds

Ordered a size down and they are perfect Love the look and how they fit with my wardrobe

Great shoes but even though I have other 10 pairs of shoes all of them 10 5 size these feel more loose when I walk

This sneaker is the ultimate low profile classic sneaker Can be also worn in an elegant and sporty way with a blazer combined with a pair of jeans or slim rolled up dress pants Timeless and simple

This shoes are very comfortable shoes I love them

I have always loved adidas products and always will

It is a good quality product and it is a good price

I simply have had great respect to Adidas brand most of my fifty years of age And I will continue to support your brand

This shoe can go with any outfit is extremely comfortable and a great price

The shoes are comfortable and always a great choice with casual clothes

Stan Smith shoes have the best soles for handball and they are pretty good for hiking too I am so glad that Adidas brought these back

This a classic from Adidas and it is together with Adidas Superstar the best sneaker you can wear Perfect to get wet during summer sesion mud in mud races or just to wear it in every situation work university

I love Stan Smith shoes I have 4 pairs but I think they get wrinkly too fast

priced right shipped to the door

Based on reviews on these sneakers I had to try them out and love the look feel and comfort I only wished I knew about them 20 years ago

The Stan Smith is a classic They go with any outfit and can be worn without socks Perfect for summertime flexing And at this price how could I not double up

These shoes look great and are very comfortable Everyone in our family has a pair

They just never go out of style I can wear with leggings or jeans and always always feel I look greataddidasrockstansmithlovemystans

Just do not be afraid to get them a little dirty A classic must have for a stylish man

Is a good looking pair but with the past of the time the painting of the shoes looks like it is broken

this product is light weight and durable it is comfortable to wear

It was a super reasonable price So reasonable that I bought 2 I am extremely happy and will be buying more Adidas in the future

They match with everything and are a decent comfortable shoe

it is a reliable product that I have worn for 35 years Good prices and efficient service

Only shoe my husband will wear for tennis and off the court Hard to find at times especially 9 5Need more production I buy two pair when I do find them

I do not know why there always limits quantity And always not available for navy blue stan smith

Good product fast shipping Very stylish and comfortable to wear

Only a tiny flaw or two So small I am probably the only one that notices as I am a bit over the top with checking my shoes quality out

Love these shoes they go with everything and look great Cannot beat the quality of full grain leather sneakers for the price Highly recommend

Love the shoes just a little small for my wife feet

Dad loves the shoes that i bought for him Will definitely purchase next time

The shoes are HUGE I own many pairs of shoes and wear 11 in every shoe this one fits larger than my roommates size 12 Absolutely ridiculous

Awesome fit love the comfort would recommend shoe to everyone

Comfortable and stylish pair of shoe Leather is great for col weather

Easy to clean and super stylish A great buy any way you put it The leather gets dirty but cleans with ease making them last a very long time I am in love with them

It was what I was expecting and shipment was fast

These shoes are almost identical to the pair I wore to play tennis in the early 70 so did everyone else The only difference I noticed is the tongue although memory fades a bit over 45 years They will serve perfectly as casual sneakers and occasionally for indoor Pickleball

have been wearing them since the 90always a good fit and color matches Have had green navy and white trims

The shoes are comfortable and look great Shipping was extremely fast

The quality of this product was horrible and it is not worthy of even being sold at an outlet store

I have had a fresh pair of Stan Smiths as part of my wardrobe for the past 15 years They look great with jeans chinos and shortsthey are very versatile They are also suitable for leg day squats and deadlifts due to the flatness of the sole

Definitely recommend

I have always been a fan of the OG Stans finally got to get them at the right price and I do not regret it at all

These are my first pair of Stan Smiths They are very comfortable and look great I will probably get another pair once this pair wears out although these shoes seem to be very durable for casual shoes

Classic clean shoe can not wait to get them broke in and a little dirty so I will be reminded of a pair I Gaf years ago

very nice classic shoes can wear with business casual or everyday outfits

it is comfortable and great quality I would recommend these shoes to anyone getting the other colors soon

I was very disappointed when Adidas discontinued the Stan Smith shoe and delighted when they brought it back CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMI believe the online buying experience could be improved

it is a great shoe I plan on buying more shoes from adidas

Shoe looks great It is too tight on the sides though A bit too small though every other shoe I own in this size fits perfect So I am not sure why this one is like it It is great quality though I recommend it still

Though I own several Adidas shoes this model is by far the most irregular in terms of sizing

Comfortable shoes that last a long time and are very stylish Overall happy with the purchase

gets dirty easy and makes my feet hurt after wearing all day

Have A Happy Holiday Addidas Team

Great classic show Fit as expected Looks fresh and clean

I like it it is clean and fashionable I will recommend this to friends and family

I do not received the order until now Next time I am not ordering on line

Everyone needs a pair of white leather sneakers these with the slight off white sole makes them so stylish Also so comfortable Get yourself a pair

Beautiful looking shoe that will go with pretty much anything in your wardrobe Very stylish and comfortable to wear and I do not mind the leather uppers creasing in my opinion it gives it personality and makes it uniquely yours Toe to heal it runs true to size however the shoe does run a bit narrow I am guessing it is just designed that way I did not size up as it made it too big for my tastes All in all just a great shoe to have in your collection

high quality construction for a reasonable price

Stylish stays clean and comfort can wear with every outfits

My son wanted a new pair of these shoes and he has an older pair and loves them

I just got this today and it have a crease in the toe area and minor scratch in the side of the shoe Been a customer of adidas for many year I am very disappointed

I like how the shoes fit on my foot Other Adidas shoes fit a tad small at 11 and I had to return them but these feel pretty nice

My boyfriend loves the style and the comfort He has the all black all white and the white with navy blue He loves them

Super versatile Goes with everything and very stylish

My first pair of Adidas and could not be more pleased

OLD SCHOOL IS THE BEST AND THE STYLE FITS EVERYONE

Great shoe great stylish shoe love it

Wanted to upgrade my white shoes Best recommendation ever

These fit perfectly and they are nice looking and comfortable I have two pairs

Flash back wearing for 1974 Varsity Tennis West Allis Wisconsin

have worn these since I was young and I am old now and they are consistently awesome

it is almost impossible to find an all black comfortable shoe in a size 20 This shoe is really nice with a good price and fast shipping

These shoes are really easy to clean with a wet rag or towel

Great shoe super comfortable and goes well with school uniforms too

Adidas done it again nice sneaker and delivery was prompt

I was very careful when wearing my new Adidas and try not to bend it when I walk But the shoes started to have wrinkles and looked old now I am very disappointed the shoes is expensive

Classic Stan Smiths with supple leather upper So comfortable

If you have ever owned a pair of Stan Smiths there is not much that needs to be explained This is an all purpose sneaker and Adidas staple This particular color way added some cool new features to it while still maintaining the original vibe I love them and plan on wearing them more around spring

Because they look and feel exactly what I thought it would It met my expectations

Dress it up dress it down This shoe is for everything

Very comfortable shoes with great support on the heels Took no time to break in and they go well with a million different outfits Excellent shoes for the money just need to make sure to wipe off smudges and spills quickly on them with a d and towel

Product was actually a gift for my father he has had these when he was younger and loves the look and comfort

My shoes came as if one of them had been worn with the leather on the inside of the left shoe showing signs of wear The shoelaces were not tied together like a new shoe would have Just seemed off Besides that everything is pretty nice albeit the shoes felt slight larger than my actual size

Great pair of sneakers but you really need to take care of it though

As a college student I am always on my feet walking from here to there and with colder weather coming up I wanted some shoes that were hardy and fun to wear These have met all of my expectations They go with ANY outfit and are so comfy you just never want to take them off Walking is a joy when your shoes are like this If you are on the fence BUY THEM NOW

classic and old fashioned but this is the point that gather my attention

I xef xb8 x8f Love the shoe but it feels a tad bit tight but it is fine I xef xb8 x8f got a 6 5 in men but next time I xef xb8 x8f will get a size up

The shoes fit style and are extremely comfortable

I love this product because I can put my name on them

Stan Smith is a must have no questions about it

it is very confortable The quality its fine it is like in the picture

look exactly like the pictures and excellent quality as usual

stan smith always great

These Stans are my first purchase off of the Adidas website and I am very pleased They look very sharp and are comfortable

I love these shoes simple design executed perfectly They get more comfortable the more you wear them

I have gone through who knows how many pairs of white green trim SSs since about 1970 They look and feel great with any casual wear They do not actually wear out just get so dirty scratched that is becomes time to pass them along Recently bought my 1st pair of other than white green black and glad I finally did They look great too

classic style iconic silhouette that goes with everything

Iconic the original that all designers have copied need more colors in Stan smith i own all of them currently

Welcome back Stan Smith I would highly recommend purchasing this product

I finally got bought myself a pair of Stan Smithand I am very pleased with my purchase Not only were they very reasonably priced but the quality is outstanding I believe that every man should own a pair of white leather sneakers and Stan Smiths were the original They go with anythingwhether you are wearing athleisure wear shorts and a tshirt jeans and a button down or you want to dress down a suit these shoes do the trick

I like the style I do not like the leather quality or arch support The leather creases on the inside of the shoe too much I would suggest more arch support on the inner part of the shoe to prevent creasing

Well made and last longer than most similar tennis shoes Wear them for everything

I love these shoes I had to buy a size up from my regular sneaker size

since it has all size with the same kind for my family

Because this shoe has class and is comfortable I realy love the look

The sneaker is overall nice quality and comfy it is simple and goes great with anything Only complaint is that it runs big I had to exchange it in store I am a true size 9 but exchanged it for 8 1 2

Look like the original Stanall the way down to the colors

Excellent item everything is perfect Adidas is a great brand

I liked it because it was the style that stood out

I was hoping they might stretchbut no such luck

I enjoy the reliability of the product The look has a universal appeal

I like his product because it is very stylish comfortable clean look and it is just great I have gotten so many compliments about my shoes They are great with daily outfits and everything

After first getting the og Stan NavyI thought the colorway was super clean but for me the stiff quality of the leather really ruined the experience for me over all After trying on these lux leather ones my opinion is that this should be the standard for quality on all of the Stan Smiths So soft and buttery



Its nice and wide works extremely well with black pants great confidence booster

These shoes fit great and look great and there very comfortable

Nice shoes comfortable and fit well I recommend them It is annoying that my review has to be a certain length

good looking shoe could use a better sole goes well with all dress style

These are EVERYWHERE in New York Which is a good thing I wanted them months ago and I did not buy them I could have beat the crowds it is never too like Now I have to buy my GF a pair

Look great Light Feel good on Could be a little wider and a little more arch support Great buy for the price

it is very comfortable and fits perfectly true to size

I have been wearing this shoe for 4 decades for Tennis I find them comfortable on the court and I can count on the quality and performance it is not their fault if I miss a shot

I like this product because it is nice and casual and can wear it with anything

TOO BIG Mensize 9 5 looked and felt like size 11

Clean looking white leather or black Boost great

Had these same shoes in the 80and glad they are back

The shose very Comfortable I buy this shoes give my friend more

Love red and love the Stan Smiths but I wish Adidassizing was consistent Had to go down half a size my true size is 10 5

liked the shoes but sole wore out quickly working outside

it is just like the og Stan smiths with much better leather The sneaker is just a little bit larger than your actual size but not large enough where you would have to go half a size down

I love the look of the shoe that is until you start moving The leather is very thing so when you move in the shoes they look all wrinkled and the leather spreads over the sole making the shoe look ill fitted

The style the color the overall shoe is dope

I have been wearing these for 30 years They never go out of style comfortable and they last

These are my first Stan Smith shoes I buy and let me tell you The comfort is real I am a daily walker and my feet do not hurt I definitely will buy again

Love the stan smith shoe for years Finally got a pair in black And they are awsome Just as comfy as the others

Purchased these shoes as a gift and he loves them

I wish the tongue was original thin leather I do not like the thick paded tongue

excellent material beautiful design

Super rad Love these Good cop for sure Looks good with everything

Love it cool design But little bit hurt when you walked in long time

I like adidas shoes stem smith white nice and clean

I like my product because it was exactly what I ordered and I received it with no issue

Adidas sent me these shoes used There were scuffs on the bottoms sides and top Also the shoes were already creased BEWARE WHEN BUYING THESE

My teenage son bought these shoes The higher quality leather was worth the price point He loves them

Not much cushioning and as I said although size 12 usually accommodates my orthotics these were a poor fit

The fit is perfect the style is timeless and the shipping purchase process could not be easier

Great price for such a good quality shoes Also very light and easy on my feets

it is perfect for a casual date I highly recommend them

it is one of the best shoes i have purchased that is Adidas

I have been a Stan Smith Sneaker fan since the 80Love the fit Everyone keep asking where I get them fromAdidas com

I like it is Classic style and goes with everything

Both my boys 20 22 have a pair and love the comfort and the style

it is a good looking quality stylish shoe it is comfortable and low key

I am very pleased with these sneakers I had a pair as a child and always liked them I do think that they are a bit overpriced should be more like 50 a pair but I was very pleased with the speedy and free shipping Already received a few complimentsthese look great with jeans

These are the only casual shoe my boyfriend wears He loves them and they fit him very well Have to buy a new pair every time he wears out the old pair Great product

Fantastic shoe Work well with everything Happy I bought these

I would forgotten how much I missed my Stans from back in the day Lately I have been updating my wardrobe including my shoes As I got older it was easy to go for the slip ons for work and play and it suddenly hit me that they all look the same It was time for a change so I knew my first pair of sneakers had to be some white leather Stans They are were even better than I remember and the fact I that could personalize them was so cool My wife was somewhat shocked when she saw her name on one and mine on the other A fitting tribute to myself my wife and Stan the Man Adidas rocks next week we will be in Manhattan for my birthday and we will be stopping by the flagship store so I can pick up my new Superstars

These sneakers are really comfortable and stylish I think that these fit me well personally and they are a great buy

Consistent quality that has remained unchanged but is still just as functional as ever

does not go out of style it is a simple design

Feel great about my purchase Great style and comfort

They wear well and last long and have been available for purchase since they were invented

I love everything about the Stan Smiths from the quality of the leather to the lightweight and comfortability of the shoe to the classic look and style This shoe is very versatile allowing you to rock them with different outfits The only thing that I hate about the shoe is the way it squeaks when I walk or simply step from one foot to the other With some adjusting of the tongue and laces the squeaking will temporarily go away but will return as I walk I do not know if this problem happens to anyone else but this is one of the reasons why I do not rock the shoe too often the squeaking is really an attention grabber especially in quiet areas

Been wearing Stans since the 70classic styling This new version is narrower and not stitched all around on the sole like previous editions but lighter weight Give them a try

These fit perfect as always but one of my shoe had a blue mark on it otherwise they are very nice shoes

Stan Smithare a very nice casual pair of shoes perfect for any event that does not include alot of walking

Style like the shoes want a Black Trime pair All the Best

These shoes are sharp and perfect for casual wear I was looking for some great sporty casual shoes and these right here are it

I have been wearing these shoes for forty years as they fit my foot very well These new ones no longer fit and the overall quality is not as good They are to small and the arch support is now missing no longer comfortable to my foot Will need to find something else

These shoes run big so in the future I would order a size smaller Otherwise very happy with my purchase look and quality of the shoe

Exact size color my son had been looking for as he was unable to find in store

If you wear these chances are you have good style These shoes look good with most outfits They are a great shoe for summer paired with causal clothing

Because the unique color looking quality and classic Stan smith model

Love the colorway and its versatility with any type of outfit Best purchase of sneakers I made all year

Classic stylish shoes can not go wrong with a pair

Beautiful clean design I really like them My heel pops out just a little bit but overall that is the size I need to have with Adidas

Uncomfortable good shape good material average stability

very uncomfortable returned it for a different style Stan Smith

Loved the product but I had to exchange the first pair because they run too big so I had to size down from my original shoe size

I absolutely love Stan Smith original sneakers best quality and will always be an amazing classic style Must have

Would like to return the material feels cheap and not sufficient

I like the style of the show I hate the fact that the front rips easily

Great sneaker great fit Very happy Highly recommend

Simple classic style shoes Have been wearing them for years

It goes with every outfit even formal wear on the go and even to the office

The sneakers are really comfortable and good for the summer time because they are not too hot Got a lot of compliments and I am planning on buying more in different colors

This shoe is very nice I ordered the Navy White pair and it looks very good The Navy is really dark and looks black unless you look closely Order half a size smaller than usual if you are looking for a good fit

Amazing fit and super comfortable Looks great with any outfit

They look dapper with the right clothes I am going to order another pair

I like the product because it goes with most of my clothes and I like to match when I wear stuff so yes They are very comfortable and stylish and I would recommend these to a lot of people

It has a clean smooth look and design It is very grippy I feel secure like I will not slip it is comfortable

Really comfortable Looks great Would buy another pair

I play tennis and I really wanted a shoe to play good in and this shoe was perfect

These shoes are a classic and look better the longer you wear them I customized a pair for myself

Wish the back was green like the white ones I think I would look better

Leather lining makes all the difference for a comfortable fit and ware

Great shoe may want to have the show a half size larger but regardless is fantastic in terms of quality and fit

Pretty good price for a pair of shoes I absolutely love

The size that held my heel was too short The size that was long enough did not hold my heel and felt like a clown shoe

I have been wearing only Stan Smithsince 1972 I buy 10 at a time because used to worry they would be cancelled Only complaint is you used to cushion the tongue but stopped Why

Very confortable nice look very high quality sport shoe

THE DESIGN is great because the shoes is versatile and can be worn different ways

Casual Style Very comfortable Good price I love it

Perfect fit and very comfortable I thought that it would get dirty fast but boy was I wrong

I love these shoes super comfy and I love the look

Great look and fit Will purchase another color soon

It fits really nice very casual and comfortable very stylish with skinny jeans and jogger fit

They look nice but they feel a little uncomfortable maybe because they are new

These shoes are really comfortable they match with any clothes

they look dope and you can wear them with everything They are also very comfortable

just overall an awesome shoe great value for the money spent

Past years insoles was more arch support Now flat

Absolutely too narrow Plus they are monogramed so I cannot exchange them Will not purchase again

I was so happy to get these shoes as my FatherDay present and I love that they are as comfortable and cool as I remember them

Great shoes very comfortable and can wear them with about anything Would definitely recommend to buy as many as you can

Got them for my brother as a gift He loves them

The shoes look great they are comfortable and I like them a lot

be careful if you customize it I paid for the customization to add my name to the shoes Never happened

Classic and stylish sneaker that works with suits or jeans without missing a beat

I would tell people to buy this product only if you have narrow feet Wide feet people stay away

love the look love the look love the look ok

i put the shoes on and i was transported back to the days when Stan Smith was still playing Then i climbed a flight of stairs and that high was quickly gone i have always loved the classic look of these shoes and nothing has diminished that

They look great with anything you wear also very comfortable

Have own a pairof these bad boys for years and they remain the same every new purchase Please do not ever change

Purchased the all black Classic Clean What more can you sayBuy the other colors tooIf you do not know how Stan Smiths feel look smell tasteetc then you do not know sneakers

Great shoe at a great price This is a classic for a reason

I have been buying Stan Smith for years The top of the line is the most comfortable

I like this kinda style because of how casual it is It does not stray too much on the eye to be focused on which is nice

Looks fresh Fits perfectly Really comfortable Nice

Nice clean look would recommend to all people that want something simple

it is just what I needed and it fits well and is stylish

Very simple and easy to match with Ideal for minimalist people

Looks great with a lot of outfits Wrinkles easily though and a bit stiff at first

Shoes had creases in them prior to wearing them

These shoes are longer for sneakers and run on the narrow side I would say that it is true to size for length based on Brannock but it is narrow so you may need to size up The shoes are very comfortable but I wish these did not have the padded tongue although it probably helps with the comfort

great classic style I like the color and the softness of the uppers

My son really enjoys the look and feel of these shoes

Love this shoe it is so versatile and easy go to sneaker

Very bad quality on wearing just 2 times It looks like when someone order online Adidas send the worst things that they have I will not recommend

I love it bc it is comfy and amazing you should buy and cop

My only problem with these shoes is that they are a little narrow in the toe area Wish Adidas came in wider widths As we get older our feet our less forgiving with a fit that is not totally comfortable for athletic shoes

Authentic classic but still feels contemporary and cool

I like that shoes I macth the shoes with my family everybody likes

Fit and Fashion style comfort color retro ease

Plenty of room in the toe Pretty comfortable after working on a concrete floor with no mat for 10 12 hours

Nice classic shoes from Adidas Sometimes you have to go with originals

These Stan Smith shoes are very comfortable and look great with all sorts of outfits Great walking shoe Can wear with shorts or jeans and look great Nice job with keeping these shoes around

I love the Stan Smith shoes You can dress up or down The most comfortable ever All my family is in love with ADIDAS Always

It was a mensneaker it was too large Just need the right size

They are cool No really they are cool Did I mention they are cool

I really like the shoes comfortable stylish reasonably priced

Customised lettering could be larger Otherwise they are great

it is a great looking classic and feels great on my feet It works great with many different outfits

My wife bought two pairs several months ago she recommend it to me and I am the fans now

I absolutely love the shoes They go well with any clothing

Very comfortable but it is half size bigger than Superstar

Comfortable and looks great Shipping was very quick

good value for price and quality and good fit also

Great shoes they are lightweight and easy to walk in

Love it My go to school for staying casual at school

Not upto the mark quality not as i expected product looks different in real and in picture

The Stan smith is a solid shoe I think I messed up and bought a half size too big which causes it to tease oddly in the toe are Other than that the shoes are super comfortable and you can tell they are well made

Timeless design Awesome clean lines classic look and comfort New pair ever year in any color since I was a kid Highly recommend

Great shoes for casual wear Recommend 1 2 size down

I find the Stan Smithto be simple stylish versatile and affordable I am very happy with my shoes

I used to have a pair of these shoes back in the 80They are extremely comfortableso you can imagine how thrilled I was to find out that they were still available

I love these classics These are summer staples and are a must year after year

These are not bad I am curious about the boost version now Buttery soft leather too hey you can not go wrong with these I am still breaking them in so the comfort is not A1 yet I hope

Cool trying to change my babymother types of shoes and she really likes it Thanks Adidas

This show goes with everything A great price point for a show that never goes out of style

Quality of shoe was not there and uncomfortable Runs a half size big

Nice quality leather The color is of white with a slight greenish cast which probably wont be noticeable after they get dirtied up Otherwise I love them

Classic Stan Smith design with a more premium feel One up those guys wearing regular Stan smiths

The shoes is comfortable to wear without socks as a kick around sneaker and a completely versatile item for my wardrobe

I have been looking for these forever Almost as good as they use to be

These shoes go with about any outfit and are very high quality I wear these almost daily and they still look new

Fashion shoe Will be good as walk around shoe Like the choice

Have had a pair previously and bought a second pair because they are the most comfortable shoes I have worn

Very comfortable casual walking shoe Satisfied that they do not need any additional insoles for proper fit

So I was watching a Netflix show when I noticed one of the characters was wearing these familiar white tennis shoes with a green tab on the back instant flashback to my teen years I lived in these shoes as a teenager But never thought they were still around to actually buy anymore I could not remember the name of these until a quick Google search lead me to Adidas website where lo and behold there they were the Stan Smith originals Added to cart immediately so happy with these Thank you Adidas for bringing back a great memory from my childhood

Stylish shoe for a good price Came in a good condition without any blemishes

I have had these sneakers in the past and it does seem like the quality of the leather is not as good as it used to be It also feels as if they fit a bit narrow

I love the quality and the feel of them The look old school and cool

I always wanted to own a Stan Smith shoes They are very comfortable and make a great summer shoes

Quality poor I wore it once and started folding

Fashion younger sports I like it

I like the product do to past purchase experiences

Love the style and shape the package came on time

Very nice and look so cute first time just place one pair for my hubby and he liked it so much then I placed 3 more pairs for my self and my two little boys

because the shoes are composed from too much plastic

The leather exterior is stiff and shiny This is not the right shoe if you want a casual look Seems solidly constructed A little uncomfortable due to the stiffness

I bought these in the same size as my old Sambas and they fit perfectly and are comfortable to wear all day in our busy shop I probably walk several miles a day and my feet do not hurt at the end of the workday will have to see about the durability as time goes by

I like this show however it does not come in a 12 1 2

So glad you brought these back Great fit quality leather and they look great Love them

They are comfortable stylish classic and the personalization bit makes a ton of a difference Definitely recommend it to everyone

They are Stan Smiths what is not to likeSmith

I love the designs and comfortable materials will buy more

This product is great quality and very in style now

Great classic shoe with great comfort and looks which goes with anything

Shoes are top Classic look that can be dressed up or down

I like shoe style so much so simple and perfect i think it is one of the best shoe that adidas produce and for sure superstar also

I love the shoes but they are hard to style Overall great

it is classic it is comfortable It goes with everything Whether you are a sneakerhead or just looking for a pair you need a pair of classic Stan Smiths

good fit quality and looks These shoes are pretty fresh and have a great light feel to them I got a matching pair with my girlfriend and they look pretty lit Also these shoes look great with shorts which is important for this summer season fit is a little narrow so i wouldnt recommend for people with wide feet

Perfect beater shoes I wear them almost everyday and I get a bunch of compliments

This is my first time to wear Stan smith and it is comfortable

I got these shoes mostly for work and they have been perfect so far I am pretty much on my feet 10 or so hours a day and these have held up nicely I have been wearing them for about 3 months or so and the only think keeping them from looking new is the wear marks on the outside where my feet bend while walking Otherwise they fit true to size I did not have to break in the width like I normally do on new shoes and they have stayed comfortable

on my left shoe the dye started wearing off I work in a office with carpet I was very disappointed so I will now have to purchase another pair I am somewhat skeptical about buying another pair from you or should I go buy a store where they would replace them if this happened but I do love the shoes I have worn stan smiths for 30 years

Wish the leather was a little softer and less likely to wrinkle

Great looking shoe comfortable even after a lot of wear and weather Simple ordering and received as described Will be buying again

Love it but wish I could customize with metallic trim

I like a lot the style of the stand smith you can wear it with everything

Very good stylish shoe Not really comfortable but I did not really expect to use these to run a marathon

Great as always I have worn them for years Never had black ones before Just as good as the white ones

I am able to be are united with adidas through this classic This shoe serves along with spiritual redemption with me personally everything sort of relates to each other

So simple Goes with almost everything It works with almost every type of outfit

I have always liked the Stan Smith sneakers and have owned several pairs in white I was looking for a dark sneaker and was glad to see different colors were now available I love my black Stan Smiths

classic style that never fades

I have been buying the shoes for 40 years they are still the best

They are comfortable and trendy perfect pairs for summers

Want 2 more

I purchased the upgraded Stan Smith shoe with the softened leather gold foil logo and off color outsole The leather breaks in quickly and feels very nice The shoe is comfortable Structurally the shoe seems like it will hold up well but the white leather shows lots of surface wear quickly The white colorant on the leather wears off very quickly I do not mind having beat up looking kicks but if you are into yours looking pristine keep shopping These get that dinged up looking patina pretty much immediately

simple and fashion

Comfort superb I get compliments daily universally stylish

it is classic Stan Smeezies can not mess that up I only wish I could keep my strings cleaner

Great summer sneakers Very comfortable and stylish I got the white with dark blue Adidas heel patch which goes great with all of my shorts I also enjoy my Gazelles but the Stan Smith is a classic summer shoe In terms of sizing I buy my Stan Smitha half size larger than my Gazelles and they fit perfectly

I like it because they are very comfortable and look nice

Excellent everyday shoe The silhouette is super sleek with a low profile three stripes logo on the side and the stitching around the toe seems like it will keep the sole from separating They are also made of really soft feeling leather I am sure that these will last a long time but I am already noticing some stretch marks on the leather I guess it adds character and it probably can not be avoided with leather but I like my stuff to stay pristine It is pretty easy to keep these clean though so that is a huge plus

go with anythingdress up or down

Great reviews and I like Adidas I have good luck with this product

This Shoe runs small comfort level is stiff shoe looks good tho

this is my 14th pair of stand that should say it all

This is my 1st pair of Stan Smiths I ordered the all black pair I was immediately impressed with how comfortable the shoes were and loved the styling of them However after a month of wear the sole of the shoe developed a bubble with air trapped underneath I was able to exchange the shoes for a new pair for no charge but after another month the bubbles have formed on the soles of the new shoes as well It seems that this just happens to the soles of the Stan SmithsI have other Adidas shoes Samba Superstars and this has never happened to them

Perfect width for my foot Easy to clean and stay looking new

very comfortable and stylish classic shoes for everyone

Always fashion very good choice with this eternal chose

Just like the classic old School style just like the ones I had in high school



I bought it for my husband He loves new shoes it is very comfortable and nice

I like this product because it is very fashion and I use comfortable

Perfect price And comfortable i would recommend it

I love the shoes and my name printed on it but I made a mistake on the size and it is too small

I always want a pair of it and nice looking and price

Classic style Looks great I am glad they brought these back Very comfortable

Good Idk why they make submitting a review so hard tho

This shoe is great for the price and also very stylish

These shoes are so classy They go with everything you wear and make your look complete

Great purchse the product delivered fairly quickly fits well is comfortable and looks great What else is there

Clean white for tennis and personalized was a great addition

These are awesome I walked in them for a whole day and I did not have any problems They are both comfortable stylish and very versitile I would recommend to most but not to individuals who can not keep white shoes clean

I HAVE TO WEAR BLACK FOR WORK AND THESE SHOES FIT TE BILL THEY CAND BE SHINED UP TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS SHOE I have BEEN WEARING STAN SMITHS SINCE THE 70 LOVE them

Clean crisp classic dress up or dress down crisp white

beautiful and comfortable really nice sneakers

These sizes sell out very fast and they are in high demand

Finally some all leather white simple day shoes tennies that do not look like anime characters

Love the style of the Stans However I should have tried them in a store first

Great customized product with my nickname on it



Comfortable versatile stylish shoes I am thinking of buying another pair

Looks great and very comfortable to walk in My go to for the summer

Like the styling and quality of finishing Good value for the money

These shoes are so cool in person like I always see people in social media stunting these and honestly I get it now They are phenomenally stylish and well made My only real beef with this productlike many otherswas the size But that was entirely my own fault I normally wear a size 8 in womenand I went by the size chart and ordered a 7 in mensince I believed that would be the appropriate equivalent Well I was wrong and the shoe still came out to be too big I ordered it again men6 5 and now hope it fits when it arrives So fingers crossed

The shoes are very comfortable and look very nice Because they are simple they go well with any combination of clothes which is great Overall the shoes are amazing

Great pair of shoes you know exactly what you are getting when you buy these Stylish comfortable shoes

GREAT SHOE CLASSIC VERY COMFORTABLE WOULD DEF RECOMMEND

Fits exactly the way I like and amazing quality of course

Classic classy shoe Shipping was very fast inlike many other brands

it is very nice shoes White with collegiate red is very good combination

I have been wearing Stan Smiths for 25 years They have neve let me down

Good looking and quality sneakers Will buy again

Nice looking shoe and is actually pretty comfortable Would recommend

Still a great shoe I wore these shoes when they first came out and they still have the same comfort and quality as the original Ware them as everyday shoes

Great shoes Simple and classic Love the way they look

the product is made in such a way that it makes it hot inside the shoe need to make it bit airy

The shoes are very comfortable and they look great

The shoe is one size to big compared to other Adidas shoes I got a 9 1 2 shoe because that what I wear when i buy other Adidas bought these and the show was too big At the same time they managed to be too narrow

I have been a fan of this style of sneaker for about two years now and this is my second pair This time I opted for a smaller size because I found the first was probably too big and was happy with this decision My only grievance is that this particular pair seems to have a sort of abnormality in the leather on the right shoe near the toe I probably could have asked for an exchange but I do not want it to go to waste so I will put up with it until it is time for another pair

Loves it Wrong size returned to repurchase new size

Great quality comfortable look and feel timeless

How where its made the material and care tips also

The most beautiful and elegant shoes I ever have it is classic and a must have one

Super fresh very good looking Only downside is they are not as comfortable or as breathable because of the leather

Menfashion staple suitable for every style you can think of I am mad I waited so long to purchase some

In the past over a three four years ago I have always bought 1 2 size smaller Anyone have experience with the sizing recently

They fit my high arch and they look good They are durable and comfortable

I have the all black and wear these anytime there is a formal or business casual dresscode The leather is soft and high quality looking and the black sole makes it perfect to conceal in business environments it is MUCH more comfortable than wearing a dress shoe and holds up just as well it is more comfortable than any Nike I ever owned but not as comfortable as some of adidas high end shoes But it is timeless classic and can be worn with anything For those looking for comfort and not concerned with price there is also now a boost version of this shoe

got them for my bf and he loves them I love them to

perfect price for the shoe just super comfortable love this Stan Smith

Beyond a beautiful looking shoe has maintained it is level of bright bright whiteness and feels of great quality I walk up down 3 flights of stairs every day at work and the stairs are coated with an abrasive kind of stain aimed to improve traction but my feet are too big and if I do not let enough of my foot hangover the stair the back of my shoe rubs and can scratch I have avoided scratching my Sam Smithas easily as I have a variety of other brands and shoe types from Pumas to Fossil boots to Redwing Boots I love these shoes

Love this sneaker it is super comfortable but order a 1 2 size down as they run big also if you have wide feet you might want to consider something else as these run a bit narrow I love them though and had a quick and easy purchase they arrived at my door in no time

I do not know why adidas quality in Jordan is not that perfect I have heard it many times that the quality here is lower than other countries For the size when i went to the shop they told me they do not have 36 2 3 and they gave me 37 1 3 But in general I am in love with them

I like the product but ran a little small but you never know with the women to men conversion Returned and exchanged no problem

Great original style and comfort The velcro makes it look more unique that the regular lace ups

Is Classic and Cozy You can wear it with everything

Comfortable clean and pairs with anything absolutely in love with these sneakers and I know they will become one of my wardrobe staples

My boyfriend loved the sneakers very comfy need to get half size bigger

the outsole fell off but every thing else is good i hate how i cant wear them i might have to super glue them

Have always been a fan of Stan Smith shoes and Adidas brand in general I wanted an all white stan smith so I decided for a customized version I normally wear size 6 but since customize version can not be returned i decided to go to the Footlocker and try the Stan Smith with the green heel patch I tried size 6 walked around the store and it was perfect Size was good I ordered it and waited patiently for it to arrive To my dissappointment the size 6 is too big I can put in both my index and middle fingers in between even after i put my foot in I can not return the shoes and now i am stuck with one that does not fit So dissappointed i still want my all white sneakers but now i am debating if i should just go with another brand or try to customize it again one size down

Great shoe super comfy and trendy goes with anything Ther is honestly nothing bad i have to say

Usually a spot on size 8 5 but ordered it in an 8 because it was the only size available and I really wanted these and they fit

This product is great My only complant is that I am having major heel slippage If anyone knows why that would help I orderd my true to size

Cheap but not the shoes Instead of skin substitute Drawings brands never seen Insoles are torn Do not buy

Very comfortable shoe This is my husbandsecond pair He just loves them I would recommend these shoes

Sized down 1 2 size Quality is great just like the good old days

I like it because the bottom of the shoe is hard and it last very long

A flexible and supportative shoe Newer shoes are too stiff

I love the sneakers I wish they did not run big

really liked it Hopefully everyones can get a pair Very good quality

Amazing shoe I really do not need any other shoes except this You can wear them with anything and last forever Thanks Adidas

Extremely comfortable shoes that look super clean as well However I tried walking with them in some rocky ground and when i got home I found them very scuffed and paint scratched off Disappointed

So comfy and stylish best shoes I have in my collection

My first time bought Stan smith adidas brand I love them Very stylish and classic They gonna be my favorite from now on I ordered one size down it fit me perfectly

Comfortable great shoe for the price Would love to have in additional colors

Once again I have ordered from the website 1st mistake I own 7 pairs of Adidas So can anyone tell me why these are the wrong sizeIf those 7 I have 4 yes 4 different sized shoes Why is a size 12 not a size 12 all overGo in a store and save yourself this drama Apparently 12 inches varies from manufacturer to manufacturer SO over this waste of time SOrt it out please

Im normally a size 88 5 so I ordered 8s and they were definitely too big I would reccomebd going a full size smaller than usual 7s fit well

I like the clean white shoe look with simple design The sole has small pads to reduce the cleaning of mud from shoe bottom My feet feel cushioned

I am usually a size 8 in shoes but for this I got a 7 and at first they felt a little uncomfortable but I just had to break them in

This is the second pair of Stan Smith I got and perfect about everything Comfortable when wearing it Style and fashion

easy to buy

trendy versatile sleek comfortable and good looking pair of shoes

Clean Comfortable Fashionable Simple Everyone has it

I love them because they are fashionable and comfortable Also because the leather stays white for a long time I used to wear them in the 80when they were in style and I am happy that they are once again a fashion trend Glad you are offering them in Pink

Not what I expected Would have like it if it was more like matt black

Shoes look sharp Simple style and comfortable Would buy again

I love these shoes bc they are so stinking cute Poppies are my favorite flower and I have gotten so many compliments on them They are a tad bit bigger than I expected but not too big for me to wear Love them

Classic affordable and iconic This shoe can be worn with almost anything

The Stan Smithwere monogrammed and arrived factory direct from Portland Great experience and price The monogram is a nice personal touch great for gifting

I love thevfact you can customize a great classic shoe

ADIDAS quality is always outstandingit is also very stylish and in fashion

its great shoes fit fine they were cheap i am happy with my purchase

Perfect the stan smith shoes are the best ever

Perfect shoes sooo comfortable and sizing is accurate Must haves

I feel that adidas has changed there size chart 10 5 is no longer you have to size up a half size

These shoes crease way to easily I have had them for less then a week and they are already very creased No excessive activity was done in them Lastly they already came somewhat creased when shipped to me

These shoes are comfortable and stylish at the same time I wear them with slack kakis and jeans They give my feet the support and freedom I need to be comfortable on my feet all day

I would size down a half size but these are perfect I wear them almost every day easily my new favorite shoe

I purchased a pair of Adidas tennis shoes years ago They are my favorite pair of casual shoes They are leather with a very soft cloth material interior lining I love those shoes but they are falling apart I wear them without socks very comfy on the beach I have been looking for a similar pair for a few years The Stan Smith shoes are very similar in external appearance but lack the comfortable sole and soft cloth lining of my current Adidas I will keep hope alive

The price point is perfect you get what you pay for The fit is nice too

I love these shoes I wear them all the time They do run a little large so I ordered down and they are perfect I am usually a women8 5 9 and I got an 8

I think the color is cool and the material is super comfy The best thing about it is that you can pull up any look with this pair of sneakers

I love this pair of adidas They are a classic and they go with literally any outfit I especially love the green part of it because it makes it stand out a bit

With an arch insert

I love these shoes these are a great shoe for everyone

The shoe is nice Very versatile and great for those casual on the run looks over it is a great shoe

I can wear it with anything basically all season shoes

Too big just did not like them returned they run very big

Got white Stan Smith shoes because my favorite leisure shoes were black Stan Smith shoes that my wife said made me look like an old man

Perfect balance of style and comfort Sleek while durable Overall great shoe

A true classic I have been wearing them since 79

Looks great and seems pretty resistant to getting dirty These shoes do run really big though

I like the style of the products but what I do not like how much the shoe creases I have only wore them twice and there is already crease marks even though I have been very careful about them

Classic shoes They are super comfortable and stylish

Perfect shoe to use in basic streetwear fashion Either these basic ones or the Raf Simmons and you are good to go for a long time

They comfortably fit but are a little too wide I like the style of all black shoes I like the stan smiths and I get a lot of compliments on them

good product with ugly face on shoe tongue not sure why adidas decided to put stan smith face on a tongue but on white sneakers it is quite noticeable I would refrain to put any face on a tongue especially old guy with not such a good looks I have been buying stan smith shoes for many years because of they comfort and simple look not because I am a big fan of that guy

I used to wear these shoes many years ago Glad they are back

Super comfy looks great with almost everything only better pair is Raf simmons stans

I have worn Stan Smiths for over 30 years They are my only go to shoeGreat quality all leather product My last pair lasted 3 years and going strong I have worn mine on musical tours all over the world Keep up the good work

I bought these in my true size 6 5 mens and they were very tight for a while until I broke them in and i think the leather stretched a little It was very painful for my big toes I will be honest I will probably buy another pair in a 7 These have a classic minimalist silhouette that goes with virtually everything Everyone should have a pair of these and they are very on trend

I wore Stan Smith in the 70and loved it Now I am loving it again

Everything it says to be Comfortable stylish and affordable My boyfriend loves them

Love them I had to order a youth size 5 5 I am usually a women38 5 and the 7 5 was too big for me Finally got the right size after ordering twice

Super preppy old school Ran large I wear a true 6 and 4 1 2 fit perfectly

Price was good perfect size for me when i wear it is feel comfortable

Stan Smith Pinwheels Holy Grail of shoes Literally everywhere I go wearing this I get huge positive energy I visited SamTailor in Hong Kong and the suitmakers were immediately freaking out These guys hang out with celebrities every day for sure they want their customers to be happy but they were genuinely elated I was planning on wearing a custom white suit with these Stan Smiths Out here in Asia the design is so much more future than in the USA I really hope Adidas continues pushing the envelope and making some seapunk vaporwave tumblr cyberpunk style shoes for the kids Especially back in the US not many companies are really pushing the limits of design in that way yet I know based on my Stan Smith pinwheels that Adidas is one brand who is actively stepping it up Please make some vaporwave cyber shoes

I got these shoes because of the style but I was not sure how comfortable they were going to be or how well they would fit but I love these shoes I show them off and they are super comfortable and I can just slip them on I do recommend getting a size up

Good quality comfortable timeless design The Adidas Stan Smith are a must have in your shoe collection

I wanted leather tennis shoes I had these as a kid and loved them They lasted forever and they are great to wear all day The leather is supportive and my feet do not hurt do not get hot

I love this style shoes it is very cool and comfortable

Thank you Adidas for continuing to make these wonderful sneakers

Classic pair great quality with reasonable price

I love these shoes They look great and go perfect with pretty much anything I am so happy that I bought them

My Stan Smiths are sporty yet fashionable They are comfortable walking around town as well as running on the tennis court

I loved it I would recommend go half a size smaller

Good looking shoe that is also comfortable Fits as expected

These are my babiez A foot love affair if I may On my third pair diz is only th beginning

Should come in different colors

Super coolness that even my kids wanna rock Loving the new color options but I still own a few

I just plain love these shoes They are cute I am a 60 year old female and I get lots of compliments on them I wear them to work too

I love adidas and have bought so many shoes from them over the years These Stan Smith shoes were the most uncomfortable shoes I can recall owningand are made from materials that seem rather cheap

look the same as the old ones butt the new ones have no arch support at all Why pay for quality and not get any more than a discount store

On the surface the shoes are quite simple it is amazing that they look so amazing with such simplicity involved Adidas nailed it with these

My hubby has been wearing stan smiths for 25 yrs will not wear anything else I guess that is a true testamonial

I have quite a few Stan Smith and this will be my special occasion pair Kudos to the person that designed this

I bought this as an everyday walk around shoe and I was disappointed The shoe is uncomfortable and made walking around difficult I was excited by the look of the shoe but was very disappointed when I actually started wearing it

Love it Very simple and comfortable Would def recommend this

Adidas Stan Smiths were great in the 70s great in the 80s great in the 90s great in the 00s etc As long as the clean simple white leather tennis shoe with the green tag at the heel exists the world is a better place

I love the way these shoes fit They are so comfortable I love the iconic design but I am a little concerned about how I will keep them clean My only issue is that i had to buy an entire size down I am typically size 13 in pretty much every shoe brand but these were far too big for me I would recommend going 1 2 to a full size down

Prefect comfort look and feels very light on my feet Best shoes ever purchased

I will definitely buy more Stan Smith pairs Just love them

I have been using Stan Smith since last few years and now I do not even consider buying any other shoes

The only little downside is how easily the shoe creases which all depends on how you use wear the shoe aside from that I highly recommend this shoe to anyone unsure wether to purchase a pair or not

So i bought the newly stocked ones and let me tell you that the quality on these are bad but not horrible The soles has excess rubber cuts excess glue marks the holes which make up the stripes had cracks on them Its those small details that throw me off but overall i liked it Good quality leather and the form is just right Sizing was on point so go TTS

I am 6 5 in the runners and size 6 for women in Superstars so i ordered 6 since it is a sneaker but i came small to me

I like this shoe you know it is a little bit too big im a true size 9 but I have no clue why it is a little bit too big plus I have more Adidas shoes in on my Adidas shoes are size 9 and they fit me good I buy a lot of the distractions designer ones from Stan Smith Shell Toes I got my boots my boots 2 keep making the design at least be true to the size

My soon to be ex wife and I got a divorce and the only thing I got to keep was my vast collection of shoes This will only add to my collection Thanks Adidas

The shoes were everything I hoped for and even looked better in person Great buy that I would recommended to anyone

Love themthis pair is unquie as it elevates the Stan Smith Classic into a fashion and elegant shoe Well done Adidas

Stan Smithare clean and a solid shoe for summer months They run true to size I am a 11 5 12 in sneakers and got 11 5 as they run a tad bit wide If you have a wide foot go up 1 2 a size Otherwise great shoe clean design I recommend

LOVE this Stan Smith Shoe it is been a hit when I wear them

I really like it It looks great and it is comfortable

Shoes look awesome Totally different than 99 of other shoes

I need the shoes of kids about 4 this shose is too big to fit in it

I love this 1973 original Stan Smith I am OLD SCHOOL CLASSIC CLEAN and sMOOTH

I got the red suede Stan Smith for my wife and she loves the shoe true to size and very stylish

These are great Fit true to size maybe get a half size larger than usual for a less tight fit You will not regret this purchase These shoes are comfortable warm sturdy and match everything I have owned 2 pairs one with a green heel and one with a navy blue one Both look great but I slightly prefer the blue one

Love the pony fur and the pattern a very big fan of ADIDAS but these fit so weird long gunboat shape and flat sole that clomped when you walk returned wish you would bring back the boat lace dlx my favorite cheers

Make sure to check if it is menor womenDefinitely go for 1 size down if you are a female shopping in menshoes

I was worried about this shoes because the superstar are really narrow but i tried on and it was amazing

Look and feel great Like them so much I got the snow leopard ones too Really wanted the BBC black ones but we are sold out I recommend you buy these before they sell out

Great shoes can not wait to wear these once all the snow melts Super comfortable all purpose perfect

The title does not mean I want to write a few words

I really liked the shoe I will wear them right Trust me 

Stan smiths are really well made and look good with everything

The sizing was the only problem while purchasing these shoes I wear a WOMENS 7 5 I ended up buying a MENS 6 because for women getting menstan smith adidas recommends getting 1 5 SIZES DOWN this is just because the shoes usually run a half size big other than this the shoes are perfect and super comfortable They are super cute and i get compliments all of the time Also they are great for people with high arches like me

i love the color the price and free shipping reading the reviews about the size i ordered half size smaller i ended up receiving the correct size i ordered but smaller for me i should have stick to my original size now there is no available size on the color i wanted i still gave adidas 5 star and would recommend this product because of its quality and appearance

They are pretty comfortable and they match with almost every outfit They are great

I love how these shoes look but I have to make sure to wear bandaids until they are completely broken in because the back is pretty stiff Also they are just a little bit narrow but nothing crazy it is to be expected with new shoes

the shoes came on time i was surprised when I got it addressed to my work love it

These shoes are bomb advice all to buy a pair

I normally wear a size 13 adidas but had to go down 1 2 size in this particular shoe and that still left some room to breathe Bought one of each suede color Great shoe Casual yet stylish

The shoes have style but they are so uncomfortable Literally hurts to wear do not buy these just buy something else

Fits perfectly the materials are 100 percent genuine and premium it is my 3rd pair of Stan smith this year

Very comfortable and awesome color

The orange red is much more subdued onlinemore of a bright neon in person Love the feltnot sure why they did not just use the same color as a tennis ball

Masterful rework of a timeless design Loving the Chicago Horween Leather upgrade Definitely have to do the same in the Shell Cordovan next

I got mine personalized which takes them to another level for me

very good shoe

Im US 9 Womens I got 8 5 for these shoes however then run 2 sizes bigger than usual I should have gotten size 7 instead Hope they will restock been wanting these shoes for so long

I love the color that is on the back looks good feel green when I wear the shoes

Just bought this shoes this week and after 2 days it was delivered Fast super fast shipping Been looking for this shoes and my size luckily I was able to purchase it only The quality is perfect and the style is vintage With Adidas Stan Smith you will not go wrong baby its off the hook shoes I will pair this with my skinny and jogger pants

All in all is a great shoe Goes well with a lot of my clothes the leather is nice and soft comfortable to wear really no complaints with it so far The only thing for me is that my foot is kind of wide so it fits a liiiitttttlllllleeeee narrow but hardly noticeable Love this shoe would definitely recommend

Stans are the only court shoe I have worn From squash to racket ball over the last 30 years

I was so happy to finally get a pair of these I got the polka dot ones with the gold stripe adds a really unique but subtle touch The polka dots are actually navy so they are different than shown but I actually like it a lot better than white I am usually size 7 7 5 ended up going with a 6 and they fit perfectly so definitely size at LEAST half size down

love them 5

These Stanare amazing The leather quality is like no other sneakers I have ever seen I want to buy a second pair just to save for when these wear out PLEASE adidas make these in Black I need them in black notice I said need not want NEED They are worth it buy them now

I have been wanting to get my hands on a pair of the Stan Smiths in New Navy for a while but they always seem to be sold out in womensizes No problemI thought I will size down in the mensizeI was surprised to see that the official Adidas sizing chart only accounts for one size difference between the Menand WomenUS sizes ie a women9 5 is a men8 5 when typically there is a 1 5 2 difference for most brands I ignored my instincts and went with what the Adidas website stated and ordered the men8 5 for myselfand just as I feared the shoes I received feel a full size too large That being said they are still comfy squishy sneakers and I can pull off the larger size if I wear a thicker sock They do not look like clown shoes on my feet despite being too big and they are so stylish and cute No regrets over here but if you are a stickler for size I would recommend trying them on for fit in a store first

Ecstatic that Stan Smiths are once again readily available I am on my 4th pair

I only have good things to say about these These shoes will 

excellent product love the quality the design all

The Horween Leather is amazingly soft and accommodating for my wide feet Good fit looks great well tanned They are like the Loni Anderson of footwear WKRP Loni Anderson

I sold my car for these shoes 10 10 would do it again

Very nice and comfortable

DO NOT TAKE THESE SHOES OFF THE MARKET THEY ARE GREAT AND I HOPE YOU ARE SELLING ALOT OF THEM THE FIT IS GREAT

I have been wearing this same shoe the exact style for over 40 years It is the only tennis shoe I wear Over the years friends and family have given me other tennis shoes to wear and they just do not measure up to the Stan Smith I am a professional photographer and am outside on my feet up in all kinds of terrain and this is my everyday shoe The last for a very long time and are a great value I have only been able to find them on direct order for the past few years but as long as Adidas keeps making them I will keep buying them

One of the most versatile shoes you could buyyou can can wear with formal wear like suits or casual wear like denim

I have worn Stan Smith tennis shoes both for casual and performance on the court for over forty years Was and still is the most comfortable and stylish shoe ever made Not into some flashy design and colors Especially do not need my shoes to do that on or off the court actions speak louder than shoes

i received my stan smith with different laces than the ones online The ones i got are white with black dots that do not match the shoes at all and that look very bad Very disappointing They could have At least made sure the online description is correct or sent the right shoes as per the description I would not recommend those shoes unless you do not mind receiving surprise type of laces

Good price on these and with the subtle customization of the heel tab it really makes them special Aside from that your typical awesome black leather Stan Smiths

I bought these shoes because I am a sneaker head and I LOVE Adidas However my last 2 purchases I have not been happy The sizing is off These are more than a whole size too big I also opted for the customizing and now I cannot return them So I lost money Honestly I am not sure I will be making anymore purchases

Great shoe that combines a classic look with great comfort and performance

I love the simple lines understated entire package of this combo is there anything wrong with this shoeNo Nada Nyet

I am 7 in tennis shoes i a am a woman and i ordered 5 5 they fit great

Great shoe

Love this shoes I thought they wouldnt fit me but the are grear

so glad I made this purchase and at a great price

I usually wear womansize 6 my feet are 23cm I buy this shoes in mensize 4 5 and they fit for me perfect However after I wear them my feet feel a little bit moist and sultry Overall I really recommend this shoes They can wear with jeans dress and any other clothes

So clean and so comportable

These look like a cheap knock off with the weird puffy tongue In Europe they get the original style tongue Why does the UMarket always get the bobo versionI sent these back and ordered a pair from Europe The leather is also much nicer on the version the rest of the world gets

So yeah They are really comfy and lots of cusion in the shoe which I think is great I already have 2 pairs of stan smith LOVE YOU GUYS

This shoe was a very must this is my second pair of stan smiths and overall they are growing on me really lov them and the only complain is the creasing on the toe box of the shoe but overall its a great shoe

Love my stans all 5 of them

This shoe is nice shoe with good quality leather and has lots of colors to choose from They are very comfortable and run true to size I also get a lot of compliments on them Overall Adidas did a great job on this classic

the show is great especially the color way I picked out it is sure to turn heads I love them and expect me to purchase more color ways

I honestly can not believe how narrow these shoes are especially being a menshoe on a womanfoot I have many Stans and they are really comfortable usually A seriously cool looking shoe but there is no way i can wear them and that was even going up a size because my regular size was not available Hopefully it will work for some but I had to send these beautiful shoes back because they were so uncomfortable

It is my first time to purchase online in USA Good experience for me Thanks

i was scare cause i didnt know how is was gona fit but it was perfect have gotten alot complement on them

great shoe very nice and comfy but when I got them they already were creased along the sides this upset me very much

This sneaker is comfortable and some designs are a must grab They should make many more

Everyone has their classics and must have shoes and Stan Smiths are definitely it for me Fits true to size very comfortable and stylish at the same time

just as I expected

The quality of the leather on these shoes is awful Adidas has sent me two pairs now and the leather on each pair was creased horribly out of the box I have attached some photos

The appearance is definitely impeccable One uncomfortable thing is that after walking for 2 hours wearing them you will feel your heel a little pain maybe that will be improved after this polishing period with the new shoes

it is a very comfortable sneaker with lots of style

I like the shoes and enjoy the comfort of them The only issue that I have is when you walk the toe area slumps in

Adidas never fails They always produce amazing products that not only feel good on but make you feel good because of the comfort and style they provide

I got these and they are everything i hoped for They are good casual wear shoes with a hard sole and lightweight top Looks great and makes you feel good wearing them No regret in the purchase

best looking sneaker i own its a summer staple i didnt think they could improve the stan smith but they did well done adidas

I bought a custom shoe size 7 5 in women and they do not fit at all They are 2 sizes to big Is am a true 7 5 in most womenshoes Normally in athletic shoes I would by an 8 So be careful when ordering customize shoes I am not able to return The custom shoe does not have the same feel as the original Stan Smiths which I did have So really disappointed with the product It has a fake quality to them like a massed produced product not done right I was so excited to sport them

looks great feels great

So comfortable and extremely good quality leather molds right to your foot I been wearing them almost every day and i have 20 sneakers in my collection

Runs about 2 sizes large I bought an 8 5 and it is way too long will need a 6 5 but they are sold out and these are too long for me and I normally wear an 8 5

I am a frugal shopper and rarely do I pay full price It has to be something very personal and special to melet alone an on line purchase without first seeing the product But when I first saw these bad boys advertised I knew that I was going to get a pair Now that I have them I am thrilled beyond measure

I bought my first pair of Stan Smithin 1985 and have worn at least one pair each year since then

simple sneakers good

Great shows Great message Great cause Love them

Graet shoe i could not wait to wear it i received many complements on it due to colors and representing who i am thanks adidas for not excluding anyone

I will definitely get one for my son

I own about 5 pairs of Stan Smiths in different varieties including the tennis ball shoes This most recent pair I purchased is the best yet The two tone mesh canvas outer and the padded tongue and heal make them extra comfortable and they look great This pair has definitely joined my classic Superstars at the top of the rotation

Because the womenstyles were all sold out I ordered the stan smith in fairway white in a man7 5 I usually wear an 8 in womensizes The shoes are soft and comfy and fit perfectly with socks on

Runs big I usually wear 6 5 in women and bought a 5 5 which fit well with still a lil room Overall cuteness

My only complaint is the insoles seem to be glued on and I am one of those people who uses inserts Had to rip them off to get mine in but other than that I am loving them so far

I am a size 9 in menand I bought it size 10 PERFECT LOVE IT Great for mentoo

Glad to have this in my collection and it is a perfect summer shoe

I love the fit I love this shoe

Good quality

Fits awesomely they might look better with fat laces but not mad at the one that came with them They look good in person and even better on your feet got alot of attention because of them at a bbq

I wore Stan Smith years and years ago and I am now reminded of why I liked them so much These shoes are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned Because I have a wider foot and am on my feet much of the day I ordered a half size larger They fit perfectly

I love this design Its simple but not that simple

just wish i knew i was a 7 instead of a 7 5 i usually wear size 8 in shoes but had to size down i got the 7 5 and it was still too big but they are amazing and really comfy and they have a vintage look that is really cool

The shoes looked fantastic except that I got very disappointed when ny pair arrived They are too big for my usual size at least 1 full size bigger I could have exchanged it for a smaller size but it just felt too much of a hassle

This is the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have ever had and I have 3 pairs of stan smiths The padding is awesome and I absolutely love the color

Best shoes ever nice color and really comfortable

beautiful shoes there should be hi top model Top ten high model is the same all ugly hip hop ish look sneaker styles seem to be getting pretty bad every year whatever makes money I guess

Fits great At the age of 50 This shoe takes me back to 1977 when I bought my first pair this is my 5th pair love the classic look and feels good on my feet I like the white shoe with the green tab on the back of shoe

I live this classic Adidas Original but it runs a 1 2 size too large Had to send them back and get a 1 2 size smaller than my regular women8

I purchased these for my pre teen boy and he loves themthe classic style is coming back

Great looking shoe but also extremely light and comfortable

I wear them to the gym and they are very comfortable on the treadmill for an hour and the same on the rowing machine They are good looking and fit well

Awesome Great product and fit

Love these shoes Go nice with jackets

What I expected

Great show with great style Very comfortable with the Ortholite insoles Light weight material is breathable to keep your feet comfortable all day Has a great vintage look and feel and looks good with jeans I was told by Adidas size was the same as the Superstar but had to send back and go up a half size from my Superstars

Back in the 70s when these were introduced they became an alternative to rock instead of the Superstar or Pro Model that people were balling in These are the closest to back in the day with the premium leather used and the embossed design tongue The description mentioned a pearlalized leather but these are more of a higher gloss leather like an ilcea calf skin Adidas has done other pearlalized leathers like a purple Superstar done for the 60th anniversary but these are not for what it is worth

I recommend Stan Smith to everyone who love to be in style and fasion together with quality I ha dthis shoes for so long even when i was in college and up to now i really love the comfort and style For me Stan Smith is the best for any age love it so much

Really nice shoes

Ive been always wearing adidas shoes i just love them and these stan smith pair is not an exception im so happy with the purchase especially love the leopard print part Thanks

Would Recommend And Has My Approval

Everyone should own at least one pair of Stan Smiths

These are Stan Smiths but they are not the original Stan Smith Millennium tennis shoes that I have been wearing for years they are close but the soles are not correct I was so much waiting for the return of the Millennium shoe and was disappointed that they did not bring back the shoeI have been wearing for years I am down to my last pair that was purchased online used and will have to be purchasing something else and Sure will not be a shoe from adidas because the quality and style just is not there any longer I am truly disappointed with the release of what they call the Stan Smith I have attached a picture of what a real Stan Smith should look like

100 good the love shoes fell in love with me

These are the classic Stan Smithwith a twist They are comfy and are sure to garner compliments for their whimsical styling I am a female who wears a womansize 7 and I bought these in a 5 5 and they fit great Perfect to wear casually with jeans or dress them up with a skirt dress or slacksyou can not go wrong

Did not fit well and the quality of the leather was horrible

A good shoe I like classic Adidas shoes I do not like boost I do not like how Adidas is making almost all their running shoes with boost Adidas please make your future athletic shoes with more variety not just boost

They look sharp

Stan smith Adidas shoe is a great shoe

I really like the shoes are very comfortable

These shoes look amazing They have a great silhouette and the design is marvelous The shoeall white color with a subtle flash of green looks great I highly recommend this

Big Adidas fan from years gone by

plz reply fast

So glad that they have been are released Only issue is that after 6 months of normal occasional wear they are pretty well done for

I have been wearing these since 6th grade 45 years and never thought to go any where else Always comfy and have great support for someone with a high arch Thanks for bringing them back

slightly weak

These LOOK LIKE Stan Smiths Stan Smiths used to be the best shoes ever Now not so much I have never owned a pair of sneakers that clunked when I walkedbut now I do I have no idea what the new sole material is but it is hard and unforgiving Stans used to have awesome arch support cushy insoles These have the barest minimum of insole padding It makes me sad really

I have been using this sneaker since college uptil now Last time I bought this was a little less than a decade ago and been trying to preserve it since I thought I would never find another one ever So glad to know its produced again with much more flavours Great job guys Thank you

I have been wearing stan Smithsince the 70When you took it off the market I shopped every store internet flea market that I could find just to get a pair My children sent me the ad that you put Stan Smithback on the shelf I could not be happier Bravo Kathy

My son says these shoes are very comfortable and he loves them

I referee and these give comfort and performance

These Nike shoes are always comfortable and fit correctly I have never had a problem with them Third pair

Have bought numerous pairs of these My husband is hard on shoes and goes through 2 3 pairs per year He has worn this same item for several years He requires good support due to foot problems This shoe has served him well for several years Just bought him two more pairs to have on hand

My Dad just started therapy classes and he needed better shoes so for this great price he purchased 2pair black and white He loves them

Great support very comfortable I can fit my store bought insoles in easily Only reason for 4 stars is feet can sweat in these

The pad on inside back of shoe is too big wont allow heal of foot to seat correctly thus making the shoe feel sloppy and not comfortable

I wish you companies would send these reviews after Christmas since most purchases are gifts

I purchased the all black shoe for work hoping it would make my constant walking on concrete more tolerable The result was better than expected This is one comfortable shoe I liked it so much I bought a second pair

I took a close look at my 2013 Air Monarchs that fit comfortably and I do not see any label that indicates they are Wide shoes The current Air Monarchs I just received are very tight a little too tight to make me think they will not break in after a week of walking like my old 2013 Monarchs did

I have tried for years to wear more fashionable shoes when running or going to the gym but I keep coming back to these They are heavy compared to shoes made specifically for running but these are the only shoes in this price range that I can run 3 miles in and my feet do not hurt afterwards I have flat feet and bunions so I am a special case Dad shoes for life or until I have bunion removal surgery on my feet

Now I know these shoes get classified as dad shoes but I do not care what anyone says these are lowkey fire

This is an old model sneaker and I am surprised that it is still being produced by Nike but it appears to be a popular shoe which is fine My father purchased this same shoe about 15 years ago and then he purchased a pair last week which I promptly returned for him They look clubby uncomfortable and completely out of style I guess they are OK for the grandfather look but my dad needs something more comfortable in terms of fit and sleek in terms of appearance and durability he is a morning walker and this is not the shoe for that considering the hills in San Francisco

Definitely recommend these but I wish they would make extra wide in different colorways That light green looks awesome I used to wear Air Jordans until I turned 50 then I had to wear wider shoes

This has been my go to shoe ever since they replaced the previous Air Monarchs I go through a pair every 6 or 7 months but recently the last three pairs the sole has been coming loose from the shoe in the toe area First the blue part followed by the white on both sides The makers of Shoe Goo like me because I use it to repair the toe area and keep the shoes servicable There must have been a change in the adhesive used to affix the soles to the shoe because this never used to happen and I would wear out the soles before any other part I guess I will have to search for another go to shoe since this pattern has developed

This shoe is the king of all Comfort is no problem with these shoes I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a shoe to last them a long time

The date was November 10th 2005 Will Smith was still making good movies Lance Armstrong was an American hero and everyone disliked Alex Rodriquez I was turning 18 years old with my whole life ahead of me when my sister handed me a glowing package that though tightly wrapped looked as if it was barely holding back a piece of the sun When I opened the box I heard an angelic chorus sing smelled the desert after a fresh rainfall and saw two dozen white doves whisk into the sky At that moment my life changed

Bestest shoe ever Been buying an wearing these shoes for 20 years Just wish they came in different colors

I have bought these in the past and really liked them but my last pair in less than 2 months where the toe of the shoe and the sole meet came apart and look terrible and also water leaks in now when it rains I am on my feet all day at work and do a lot of walking on my job and these just do not last

I have owned many pairs of Monarchs Always happy with the size and comfort of these shoes As a teacher I am on my feet for many hours per day They are great walking shoes

I have bought numerous pairs over the years I wear them for work I do a lot of walking where as they are comfortable and definitely made for wide feet the last couple of years they only last about three months before the soul comes apart from the leather in front of the shoe as I am writing this I am looking at the front of my shoes and they have come apart I bought them three months ago They used to last 8to12 months

I never almost never get tired of buying these shoes They are great knock about shoes for walking working or just plain standing on your feet all day Very Comfortable If it were up to me I would give them 6 out of 5 because they are very affordable

These are good shoes for puttering around on the weekend or in the office The squeak is real I tried using foot power but that only worked for a week I had some old inserts in another shoe swapped them out and no more squeak

I got the extra wide and they are extremely comfortable I use them mainly for casual wear The wide sole allows me to walk long distances in comfort A very good shoe especially for the price

I bought a black pair then bought 2 more pair at a great price are you kidding me AND I play golf with them they feel great but I also wear them other times but I got a ton of nike the best i quit wearing golf shoes 12 years ago and wear strictly nike shocks and got tons of compliments on them but my one foot has been hurting so I changed to these mainly cuz of the leather you know it gets wet on the course AND these are so perfect 5star baby

I use them for gym workouts they are very comfortable wearing them and lightweight

I got this a a gift for my boss who is on his feet 12 hours a day He loves the feel and they are very comfortable

Very comfortable and durable niceee on grass or on the hardwood this sneaker is tops for is price

Good shoe for the price Very comfortable if your on your feet all day like I am Good padding and support

I have owed about 10 pair These are great They last me about 6 months to a year I always have 2 pair the nice clean new ones and the worn ones I walk the dogs in and mow the lawn with

i have a air bubble in my left shoe that will no go away and is extremely uncomfortable even with a gel insert its highly noticeable while walking and running the quality of this product is sad

It embraces the foot but the material outside does not look good as it is in pictures

I really like this shoe in terms of style The classic Nike swoosh and the great arch support are a plus for added comfort when walking and running The only downside is the shoe is a little narrow on the insole and there is a little tightness in the toe area Maybe I needed a wider shoe

The fit and feel of these are great but the squeak is overwhelming They squeak is so bad you can hear them 2 rooms away It was awful could not stand it sent them back After looked them up and it is a known issue If they could fix this I would buy them

I have several foot issues I need a wide shoe that is also strong These are the only shoes that have fit the bill Thanks Nike Please keep making these

My husband has been using these shoes for years They are very comfortable and he loves them

Have worn this shoe for years as specified by my foot doctor Last three pairs have had the sole come loose and have not had help in replacing Have been told that the problem has been fixed so I purchased again Shame on me now Am trying to see what Doc suggests now Disappointed

I bought this set of shoes to wear everyday I picked the color black so it would not show dirt I wear them while at the gym Just right for walking on the track or treadmill I use them when I am on the stationary bike and at the end of the day my feet are not tired I recommend these tennis shoes for any one looking to buy at a reasonable price

Been very happy with them Great everyday and athletic shoe Good casual play in the gym and outdoors

I totally love these shoes They are extremely comfortable I wear them in a factory environment and my feet do not hurt at the end of a 12 hour day Only problem is these shoes squeak After about four months they have started squeaking This is my fourth pair and all have had the same issue I usually buy the standard white but this time tried the black pair and it is squeaky also Hopefully this can be fixed by Nike Any suggestions on a similar shoe that will not squeak

I like the shoes so far They did run a little big and was rubbing but was able to adjust I wish there was some better colors for the shoe but since I only use them in the gym not a big deal

Love these shoes On my 5th pair now The 4Efit perfectly and I love the Style Love the Nike com website for additional styles that my local outlet store does not carry Best customer service Period Already placed a 2nd order Looking forward to my Air Jordan VIIINike com gets an A

I love these shoes I know that Zappos has them in a White Cool Grey Anthracite color I just wish they came in XW I would buy 10 pair in that color I understand having the boring colors but maybe have a pair in some more modern colors as well Thanks for making them in XW for us big guys

I have been wearing the Nike Monarch airs now for over 4 years and I am on my feet for more than 10 hours a day They are the best fit and comfortable I have found in any brand No squeaks and very durable

Liked DislikedHas anyone experienced the soles coming apart from the sneaker itself I love the sneaker but every pair I have had always seem to have the same issue I normally purchase 3 pairs at a time because I love them but when I told Nike they said that they were too old Even though they were brand new and unused So I am just curious if any one else had this issue

My second pair I ran the other ones in the ground This time I bought the black ones in wide Very comfortable all purpose shoes Never had a problem with the squeaking as some complained about

The squeak everyone experiences is caused by a loose outer sole Nike get your act together and either redisgn the sole or use better glue to keep it from coming loose

I just purchased my 3rd pair of these fantastic shoes so needless to say I love them I am 75 and use them to just walk in and wear daily I am diabetic and these shoes go easy on my sore feet I just ordered the black so I can wear them to church I do not like the squeak but will try washing them as suggested in another review I am ordering the white pair today and will order the black and white pair next month

Very comfortable Only second to nike fingertrap airmax training shoes came out in 2014 not available now Lets see how durable these shoes turn out to be

Comfort looks great durable and a great value for the price I have morton Neuroma and the Air Monarch IV is the only shoe I can ware without an insert I try to walk 10 Miles a day and have little to no discomfort at night I use the extra wide for traveling When I am sitting for a long period of time in a plane or a car my feet naturally swell and the extra wide make walking comfortable I purchase two to three pairs a year to make sure I have a comfortable pair available I am on my 6th pair I have tried others shoes at first but keep coming back to the Air Monarch Now it is the only shoe I will buy

These Air Monarchs are comfortable but they are somewhat squeaky My feet are somewhat wide but I find that the regular width comfortably accommodate my larger feet The insole is nicely padded but I do not expect it to stay that way for long I would recommend purchasing a high quality insole if you plan on using these shoes daily I have not had my pair for that long so I cannot comment on durability That said they do seem to be well constructed for the price

I have been buying this shoe since Nike came out with it To those who complain of squeaks throw them in washing machine and air dry I use mine for work and play the Black model will pass as a work shoe at a glance and they just last I am in mid 40s and in Skilled Trades and have worn Gym Shoes my whole life and Nike is the best quality out there I have other brands but they are clean and in bags in truck for wearing in clients homes but these are everyday wear

Ivery had nothing but problems with these shoes They constantly squeak I follow the instructions to stop the squeaking but it doesnt matter This is the last pair of Nike I will be buying

I have owned many pairs of this shoe and every one of them developed a squeak I have been able to fix other pairs by putting baby powder under the foot liner but this latest pair will not quit Sadly this pair is headed for the garbage Nike why can not you fix this problem

These joints are my go to shoes when I am stepping out No other shoe compares to the level of the Monarch The ladies love it and my feet love it Monarch Szn for life

Please fix the squeak

This shoe has been the one I have purchased for the last four times I need shoes the reason I have bought them consistently is that they are so comfortable The only thing I do not like about these is that after a year they start to squeak when walking I talked to a sales person and they said that it is the sole that is squeaking two items in the sole rubbing against each other

These sneakers although look a bit bulky and the design seems a little dated they are VERY comfortable stable for working out and walking and most of all the leather upper makes them very strong for an active lifestyle

This is about the 6th pair of these shoes I have owned over the years I love the comfort and the overall look of the shoes I will continue to buy them as long as they keep making them Price still continues to be very reasonable

It is easier and faster to order online

These are my go to sneaker for style comfort and Durability Would not wear anything else Great job Nike

Perfect shoe for cross training Comfortable and long lasting Worn these for years

This is my second pair of Air Monarch IV shoes I can not beat Nikes for fit and wear I have a narrow foot A and am hard to fit These shoes are would width but the design allows me to tighten the laces down and get a good fit I have been wearing Nike shoes for over 25 years and find them to be the most durable and well fitting shoes for the price on the market

bought these for work because im constantly on my feet for long periods of time cushioning is great while not the best looking shoe dad shoe it makes up for it in comfort

Excellent pair of shoes I use them for walking Very comfortable Fits great

The Nike Air Monarchs are the best and most comfortable sneakers that I wear I have purchased these sneakers for the past 3 or 4 years only because I get them dirty and li will continue to buy this brand and style for many years to come GREAT job Nike

Perfect carbon copy of the original white version Didnt know there was a different color

Fits and feels great Just what I wanted for working on my feet

This is my husbandsecond pair He has one foot that has been injured years ago and has to be selective on what shoes he wears He said these are the best and most comfortable shoes he has had

Use these for umpiring They are great Fit is spot on

I have two pairs of these one in black and one in white and black with red logo While neither of these pairs are as comfortable as my old Air Monarch Iiis the gold standard in comfort these are plenty comfortable Similar to the IIIs these shoes are incredibly durable and look sharp even after extended wear I like how well the white and black pair go with well white or black athletic socks For an all around any activity type of gym shoe at a reasonable price its hard to beat these

On my feet all day walking best shoes Ive ever had on the job

I recently repurchased these shoes The old shoes held up great after almost daily wear for over two years The new pair was significantly narrower Holding the bottoms of the two shoes together the width was over a quarter of an inch on each side for the same size 11 5 would shoe The sad thing is they do not offer a Wide only an Extra Wide

The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn I have bought several pairs and I have never been disappointed For some reason I have developed a problem where my feet really hurt and these shoes are the only ones I found that bring me any relief They have great support versatility comfort and they are moderately durable The black shoes are great if you have to dress up for work because they can pass off as dress shoes with their simple black design

I bought a pair of these for work and after 5 months the glue seperated on the front of the shoe These shoes are by far the best for walking and arch support They have good traction and are very comfortable to wear If you are looking for a shoe that gives and gives for standing long periods look no further this shoe is for you I just hope they fix the glue issue

I have owned 6 pair and the last two came unglued within three months I am 67 and use for walking and boating No abuse

I definitely recommend them

I have loved these shoes in the past but the last 3 pair I have gotten start squeeking and it is VERY annoying

This shoe is true to fit and excellent during my workout I am going to get another pair in a different color I am very pleased

Love the shoes great for playing tennis This is my third pair

As I have aged the front of my feet have gotten wider making it very difficult to find comfortable shoes The Air Monarch is the best fit for my feet that I have found and my custom orthotics fit well in them My only complaint is that the leather material on top that has the holes for the laces is turning pink I have the white black and red shoes but I am puzzled as to why some of the leather is turning pin

Love the shoes last along time Ive had three pair and just rotate out very comfortable

I have been wearing the Air Monarch shoes for over 15 years I buy 1 pair every 6 months I wear them every day for work and for leisure I will REALLY miss these shoes if you ever discontinue them

could not have gotten a better shoe for every purpose under the sun except swimming

This shoe cradles your foot and makes you feel shore footed This is a very comfortable shoe to wear

This is my second pair of this style I work as an instructor for the laborers union and I am on my feet on concrete floors all day and outside doing hands on These have been the best shoes the most comfortable and keep my feet from aching When these wear out I will be buying another pair This pair was every bit as comfortable as the first ones of this style I wore

I buy these shows to wear at work I spend a lot of time on my feet I can wear these all day and they still feel comfortable

Not used as a trainer rather for daily wear Comfortable fit for walking throughout the day generally walk approx 2 miles during workday Holds up well in different weather rain sun etc and stays relatively nice condition through wear

This is a great shoe to wear when not playing soccer

The sneakers are very comfortable and the size fits as expected

Shoe first of all is dope I got the white ones and not only do I wear them to train but I also wear them casually and let me tell ya the ladies love them

This is my second pair of these shoes and after about two weeks of wearing them they start to squeak They sound like you are stepping on a squeaky toy The first pair I thought it was due to a defect and I went and purchased another and it started with these now I work for a Sheriffs Department and need to wear all black shoes I will never by these again

I bought this shoe for work and I could not be more satisfied with this shoe It is really comfortable

10 10 Would fight for your freedom again

Very comfortable They have good soles for stopping and starting on the court The price was great

feel better on my foot and clean up nice

Was a regular buyer of Air Monarchs for working out and as a work shoe The past 2 pairs I have bought have had defective heal cushions that move and bulge making the shoe un wearable

Man i sold my AJ3and my Banned AJ 1so i could buy 8 pairs of these So worth it Heel cushion feels like you are ballin on a golf course Leather feels fresh off the baby calf Price point is on point But my favorite part about owning this heat is the neckbreaking looks i get from the ladies Gucci belt whitebiker denim and Snow White Monarchs with the hits of Halloween Black Fit of the century

I got the shoe for work First day wearing them very comfortable I look forward to being very happy with them glad I bought two pair

I have purchased probably 20 pairs of these shoes over the years They are super comfortable and come in wide sizes Here is the problem the last TWO pairs I bought have turned blue The white leather looks like they have been covered in pool cue chalk I wear shorts until November so it is not from blue jeans I think it might be defective sole material rubbing on the shoes but it is ALL OVER the white leather so that seems a stretch I have never had this problem before I have pictures I would love to send to Nike so they fix this shoe I do not want to switch shoes but these defective shoes literally look ridiculous they are so blue My students howled with laughter when I wore them to school the first day Please Nike fix these shoes

This is my second pair i have purchased in the last 12 months After about six months the toe pulls away from the sole of the shoe When this happens the shoe is ruined I can not walk in any wet weather because my feet get wet I walk about 5 miles a day Is there another cross trainer that is more durable let me know

I have been very pleased with this shoe thus far it is very comfortable and was reasonably price I wished I could have found a white pair

This is the 2nd pair of these shoes I have owned great looking and very comfortable

If you need black comfy walking work shoes these are the shoes for you I have been wearing them for 20 years and they last the longest out of all the work shoes I have bought

Most comfortable shoes ever Period Highly recommended

I got these for my husband and he is more of a boot guy but he loves these so much he ask that I get him another pair

Second pair in 10 years I am on my feet all day managing a warehouse for a large beer and beverage distributor and these shoes have not let me down I was extremely pleased when my wife was able to locate them still available on the website for order

I have worn Monarch Air for years and other than the squeak they have been perfect It seems as though the squeak problem has been solved but another has popped up My shoes are turning blue I bought one pair 1 year ago and after a couple months they started turning blue The other pair I bought 6 months ago and they too are turning blue It appears that the dark blue sole from the opposite shoe is rubbing against the other shoe and the color is staining them I have used everything possible to clean them and have used white shoe polish but nothing helps Has anyone else had this problem with their white Monarch

Needed a comfortable shoe that I could stand in for 6 to 8 hours and it had to be publishable leather This shoe met my job requirements and my comfort goals I ordered it one size larger and added comfort gels to the insides Perfect My knees and back no longer hurt at the end of my shift

They were just what I expected and was shopping for Comfort and durability

We love these shoes but is really a shame that you do nothing to solve the issue

I have an high arch so I have to add an extra inner sole into my shoe I run almost 35 miles a week in these shoe and Prefect weight slightly heavy

I bought these black Nike Air Monarch IV primarily for work I have foot issues due to diabetes I have not found one of the other brands for diabetes that fits as well or lasts anywhere close to NIKE I like the sole of the shoe as I do not feel everything that I am walking on when outside I normally wear the white Nike Air Monarch IV for everything else

Let me start by saying that normally I like your products as does my family I am a FedEx guy and I am required to wear black shoes with my uniform I am a size 13 and it can be difficult to find comfortable shoes Which yours are My issue is this Whatever material that you are using in the heel of the Air Monarchs squeaks With every step squeak squeak It sounds like the shoe needs oil

very good and durable I have been buying air monarch for 5 years now very happy

I needed a new shoe for c and the shoes came in record time But they are too heavy I am sure they are Durable because they are so heavy The soles are thick and it just made it hard to walk cute I am 52 years old and I have never encountered such a heavy shoe Can I return themNike service is great though so you do not have to post this if you do not want to Thanks though

Shoe is very comfortable with cushion flexibility and durability Great to weight lift and cross train in Supportive yet allows for quick cuts Amazing and solid all the way around

First pair lasted 4 months the second pair lasted 6 months Both pairs the adhesive that is used for bonding the upper shoe to the lower sole failed The shoe is used for walking

This of course is only one of the benefits for me along with I can walk for miles now and feel comfort and stability in my gait As a senior I always am fearful of falling with this ailment but this shoe is by far the best on the market Oh yes being a senior I use these for exercise and walking not for sports

I have had lots of sneakers over the years none have lasted this long

I was Very disappointed with this pair A week after I took them out of the box I notice that the leather started to scratch off The same happened to the soles A month later the entire upper of the shoe started to peel off Another month of use and the soles broke entirely apart from the shoes

Wears like iron under all kinds of abuse and cleans up easily and quickly

I purchased this shoe for work purposes and I am totally satisfied I do a lot of walking and this is the most comfortable shoe that I have had on my feet in a long time

these shoes are awesome

My wife started wearing the Monarch about 10 years ago Previously she had continual problems with her feet Her doctor suggested that she try a mens shoe in a wide size She chose the Monarch wide and her foot problems were cured I tried the Monarch also and liked it We have been wearing them ever since

I have worn these for years the new shoes start squeaking after a short time Nike shame on you for continuing to put out something like this Why ruin your reputation fix the stupid squeaking issue Look on the internet youtube posts forums

These shoes are incredibly comfortable for running As many of you know they have a big squeaking problem The solution is to turn up the volume on your headphones Problem solved

Very comfortable shoe good for my back pain but they are soooo noisy Sorry Nike

This shoe really disappointed me I have always been a Nike fan and purchased these due to the amount of side and top padding that was built in and at the time they were comfortable to walk in Over the past year that I have owned these shoes they never broke in hurt my feet and constantly squeak on hard and soft floor I am not sure who could use these for training or running

I have been wearing air monarchfor a long time I can always depend on Nike to send me a pair that fits and is a good product

And unsafe

PS I do not wear jeans

Purchased a couple weeks ago for work Have worn the shoes to try to break them in The shoe platform I have no problem with it is the insole THERE IS NONE They have no cushion at all I mean NONE They state full length air What does that meanMine rarely squeak but maybe I do not hear the squeak because the soles of my feat are screaming at me I have bought CHEAP shoes that feel better than this and these are only about two weeks old ANY help or advise would be appreciated

Fit is perfect comfortable and wears very durable I wear these almost every day and they take a beating Great support and comfort at the same time

I have alot to say but i am short on time I love the shoe This is my fourth or fifth pair of Air Monarchs I wear them for walking running My current pair is the black ones but I did not like them from the start I normally buy the white red and black ones I just bought a new pair today I run on the outside of my feet I think it is over pronate or supinate Whatever the term but the outside of my feet especially my left foot really hurts I did not have that issue with the white red and black onesso I bought another pair today I have also bought these shoes for family and friends who have started fitness routines to help support them in their fitness goals Awesome shoe I do admit that the Air Zoom Structure 17s look interesting I might try them on my next purchase Hopefully the price will drop for us poor people lol Until then these shoes are excellent Good luck

I love this shoe These are one of the most comfortable and highly durable pair of shoes

I have had several pairs of the Monarchs I am 6 5 with a rather small foot Size 12 and they fit great They do have a tendency to squeak badly I fixed the squeak by removing the insole and dumping powder in and then inserting the insole After 24 hrs of wear the squeak is gone

was skeptical about this shoe after reading the reviews decided to give them a try very glad i did i read about the sound they make but have had no problems with that would highly recommend this shoe

I purchased these shoes for my husband a year ago since these have been his favorites for yearshe can barely stand to wear them as they started to squeak days after he started wearing them We were about to purchase another pair but I now see from other reviews that this problem is not exclusive to his shoes alone I would think that Nike could do a better job than this

I purchased 3 air monarch type shoes One pair last Christma 2012 one pair over the summer and the last pair around this Christmas 2013 each time with in a few days of purchace the shoes squeaked and continured squeaking the entire time they were worn

I have a Mortonneuroma and the Monarch is the ONLY shoe I have found that lets me walk pain free I originally bought them for walking because they are so comfortable I just bought two more pair just in case they are discontinued I wear them everyday

this is actually the only sneaker i can wear because of the 4e wide width to soothe ankle arthiritis and swelling and low back and leg pain

 mon Nike 90 of the feedback on this shoe is squeak related what is your official position on this Talc powder really just FIX it

These Monarch Air are not comfortable They hurt at the top of the heel portion Most importantly is the sole extends too far at the heel and I trip going down stairs

I am so disappointed in this shoe It squeaks so bad nothing seems to help them This is a shame cause Nike was the only brand I wear that fits well and this Monarch was one the few that is all black which is great as casual wear but this squeaking I just can not stand it any longer I have only had this shoe for two months and there is so much wear left in the shoe but I can not stand the squeaking I have doubts now that I will ever buy another pair of NikeDO NOT BUY THIS SHOE YOU will REGRET IT

I have worn Air Monarchs for several years This is one of the few shoes made in solid black which make them easy to wear for casual dress They are quite comfortable and can be worn all day without any discomfort to my feet

On my second pair should have learned after the first Not long after getting the shoes the incredible squeaking started Based on the fact that it is a comfortable shoe fit well and assuming I just had a bad pair I went back and got a new pair when the current ones more squeaked out than wore out Not more than one month into the new pair and it is squeaking as bad as the old ones Holy cow Like I said I could understand one bad pair but twoPlus I see lots of other complaints about this issue I will not be buying again which is too bad cause they were comfortable

These shoes squeak so bad I can not wear them in public My wife can hear me take every step from all the way across the house Sounds like rubbing two balloons together and lified it is not just my shoes eitherthere is more than one person on YouTube who have exchanged the same Air Monarch model multiple times and every pair squeaks Just go to youtube and search air monarch squeak for many results and lots of bad advice about how to fix the problem though ripping up the insert and putting a bunch of talcum powder under it does help a little

Ordered these online as not available in black at Sports Auth Had reservations due to the many comments from other reviewers about squeaks etc but after multiple months of active daily use the shoes remain dead quiet Makes me wonder if those prior authors had another agenda Before buying online tried a pair of the whites in a store The comfort of this shoe far exceeded that of all others I tried Because of that I took a chance despite the alleged sound issue and am glad I did Nike keep on making these

Bought these for my son for football training and he loved them Very comfortable

I have been buying NIKE Cross Training shoes for as long as I can remember and primarily wear them for everyday use I generally purchase 1 pair every year For about the past 7 years I have been buying Air MonarchThey are reasonably priced and very comfortable They fit me like a glove Unfortunately for about the past 3 years my Air Monarchdevelop a very loud and annoying squeak after 2 or 3 months People can hear me coming from 20 feet away Last year I tried switching brands I honestly prefer NIKEbut cannot tolerate that squeak Internet searches blogs and videos reveal that this squeak is a common problem I tried a suggested internet fix on a pair of my old Air MonarchThe fix entails lifting the insole and making an incision in the canvas at the ball of foot area and or adding powder then replacing the insole I believe this fix releases an air pocket that causes the squeak It did work My Air Monarchare completely squeak free I would like to believe that NIKE has the knowledge and craftsmanship to permanently resolve this issue for the consumer NIKE please make be a believer I really do love my Air Monarchminus the squeak Thanks

First the bad The shoes squeak after a while There I said it it is an obvious flaw and nothing is perfect

I used to wear nike sneakers all the time when i was younger Since beeing older and on a budget i bought other cheaper brands My feet have been hurting more and more as the years go on and i made the decision to go back to nike My decision was the right one These sneakers are well worth it They are very light and comfortable for all I do not to mention they look great Thanks so much Nike

I bought this shoe for everyday wear Found to be comfortable no matter how long I wear them

This shoe is very comfortable on your feet especially if your require to be on your feet for a long period of time I use these shoes for work and I am require to be on my feet and moving around and allows me to do my job instead of worrying how sore my feet will be at the end of my shift

The shoes began to squeak as if the glue holding the sole to the upper failed You could feel is separate when you walk This shoe is a miserable replacement for the excellent Air Definition IV I have looked everywhere in stores and online to get the old version and it is gone forever I will not buy another Nike until they bring back the Definition

I am very disappointed with these shoes Within one month they started to squeak I cannot wear them anywhere Never buying a Nike product again

I have owned a few pairs of these shoes and will continue to buy them simply for the comfort They are just my running around shoes and my current pair is almost 2 years old and almost as comfy as when new Love them

I have had 6 pairs of the white air monarchs and had no problems with them I bought a pair of black ones because the store did not have my size in white I liked the looks of the black ones but after a couple of weeks they started to squeak loud enough that I would not were them in public I returned them to nike and they replaced them with white ones and there fine I had to pay to ship them to nike was the only lose to me Paul

HORRIBLE SQUEAK UGGGHHH I tried these shoes on at the store and they are some of the most comfortable shoes I have worn just loved them A week later they started developing a noise as if you were rubbing wet rubber gloves together it started low but now after only a little over a week they are horrendous I so upset I have to return them and just cannot believe how loud they are The noise completely overshadowed such a great shoe This issue needs to be addressed

I was having trouble with my heels hurting so I went to the store and tried on every shoe that either had an air ride or plenty of cushioning Nike Air Monarch made my feet feel the best so I bought them Within a week or two they started squeaking When I asked other people what makes a shoe squeak they tell me it is probably worn out and clearly that can not be the case The squeak is very annoying and very embarrassing to me

Shoes are comfortable but they squeak all the time I use them for work and customers get a good laugh over it I want a refund or replacement

Nike Are you seeing these reviewsThe Shoe looks and feels great but no one can stand the dam squeaking Fix or recall them already

I have worn Air Monarch IIIs for at least 8 years I never noticed any squeak But now after reading all these reviews for the Air Monarch IVs and putting on a fairly new pair of IIIS I liked them so much I would buy some extra pairs in case they discontinued them sure enough even my Air Monarch IIIs are squeaking These shoes were manufactured in 2008 Amazing that Nike has still not corrected the problem in almost 5 years

I tried adding baby foot powder as stated in other reviews and it worked

Let me start by saying I have been a loyal Nike customer for 3 decades Never had a problem with a shoe before until now I have owned other Monarchbefore and they were all great Been wearing the new Monarch IV for a few weeks now It is a very comfortable shoe with great forward and lateral movement A very comfortable shoe to wear to work or to work out It is even a great looking shoe I wish I could rate this shoe a 4 or a 5 because of these high points but I can not The problem is the annoying squeaking and quacking duck noises the shoe makes I feel like a clown walking around wearing these noisy honking shoes People at work can hear me coming down the hall from the other side of the building The noise these shoes make has become so loud and annoying that just after a few weeks I have decided I will not wear these in public ever again I am hoping to return them but if not then I will turn these into my official lawn mowing shoes

I have had the older style of Monarcs and had the same squeak problem but after readingtsloven NC Coast post about how to fix the squeak I will now buy a new pair Just grab some baby powder or foot powder and gently remove the insole and dump a lot of power inside put the insole back in and the jog in place jump around and the squeak starts to go away I had to add more to my left shoe because it still had a slight squeak the problem comes from your feet sweating in that enclosed leather shoe it is the sweat add powder

I have purchased this shoe several times as it is the only one my husband wants to wear He works on his feet all the time and says that the Monarch has the best comfort of any tennis shoe he is ever worn We will continue to buy them until Nike does away with them hint hint do not

I purchased a pair of Nike sneakers about a year ago and after a month or so they started to squeak very loud I bought another pair of sneakers different brand and relagated the Niketo my daily bike rides I recently needed a new pair of sneakers and thinking that the squek was just an anomaly I foolishly purchased another pair of NikeOnly took two weeks for the left one to start squeking I will never again purchase a Nike product

I have purchased Monarchfor years and within the past couple of years the shoes developed a loud squeek The replacement shoes sent to me are from 2010 and will shortly most certainly develop the squeek

If you already purchased these shoes cry now You are doomed DOOMED In just 3 months you will start to notice a litte squeak And in no time at all you will be squeaking down the halls at school and church forcing everyone to akwardly stare and snicker behind your back I feel remorse for you but they are quite comfortable that is a plus It will help ease your pain

I like the full length air sole I have not been able to find another shoe with it I like the extra wide I like that the Monarch comes in more than one color now I weigh over 300lbs so these shoes take a beating I am on my feet all day working long shifts over 10 hours I have been wearing the Monarch for many years I did get bored of wearing the same shoe for so long that I did attempt to find another shoe that I could wear After shoe salesmen sold me their best shoes I ended up throwing them out and buying another pair of Monarchs over and over I have not noticed much difference between the Monarch III and IV The only thing I would change would be the pivot circle on the bottom the squeeking has always been bad but with the III the squeeking started when the sole started to wear away Now with the IV it has started right away I have even tried to shave the circle off it helped a little but still squeeks

Shoe has a good fit Size is right on length and width The shoe feels a little heavy towards the front A good value in a all black training shoe

I wear these shoes to work On my feet all day on concrete Fifty one years on the job and i have found nothing comparable to these

So far these shoes have been working well for me They are comfortable I walk a lot on concrete surfaces during the day and these shoes really help with walking fatigue So far after 1 week these shoes have not started the squeaking that seems to be a problem with these shoes the past couple of years I had some of those shoes and one started the squeak only after one day of wearing I hope that Nike have looked at their quality control as it seems this has been a real problem lately

Gave shoes as gift for Christmas Son was very happy with the size fit and look

I have had at least 10 pairs of the air monarch and have found them very comfortable I stand and walk on concrete all day The last three or four pair has a horrible squeek

I like these shoes They are very comfortable and fairly durable BUT they make noise When we go to the library or in a quiet store I feel like I have to stay still or people stare and giggle because my shoes make loud noises It does not matter how I walk slow or fast or on the toes They still squeak LOUDLY PLEASE fix this I do not want to change to a different shoe Thank you Air Monarch IV

This is my second pair of these shoes THe last pair are about a year old and probably have a couple of hundred miles on them The right shoe of that pair developed a slight squeak towards the end

this shoe use to be really good every since they changed the bottom and the sole this shoe is terrible seems every 3 months i send them back when you walk they have this stupid squeeking noise that can drive you crazy i have been buying this shoe over 9 years all of a sudden the change to the shoes has make it bad nike will not do anything about it i know alot of people who wear this shoe they have the same problem nike do something about this shoe if not i will just keep returning them just received a new pair about one month now this pair starting to squeek when you walk the bad thing is i only wear these shoes for walking thank you for changing a good shoe in to a bad one Thank you Erik Empert

This has been a very comfortable shoe every day use and hiking great the down side is they are the most horrible squeeking shoes i have ever herd on carpet and tile and cement floors just about any surface the same thing if you need to not be noticed in the office or church or library do not buy these

Yeah they SQUEAK that is been bad enough but now after 8 months and still good tread the glue has failed and the SOUL is detaching itself from the shoe DurableReally hard to justify buying this shoe again

I am a senior and use my shoes always have 2 on hand and replace every 6 months for long walks daily and sometimes switch and wear all day for comfort

I walk 10 miles a day 4 days a week on concrete floors and this is the only shoe available any more that gives me the confort and durability that I need I have a very bad back and this shoe helps me get through the work day The company I work for requires upper manage personnel to wear an all black leather shoe and no other shoe maker has one available

I have had a pair of these air monarch shoes since 2009 and they are the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever had one thing that makes them better is the phylon core in the midsole I just ordered 4 more pairs in 2 differant styles I hope nike never stops making these shoes because ever since I broke my foot a year ago I cant wear any of my other shoes because of the pain Also they have been a very durable and long lasting shoe for me I read some reviews that said these shoes squeek when walking in them I have not noticed that at all WAY TO GO NIKE KEEP MAKING them

I like many others who write love this product but am fed up with the squeak I have bought 4 pairs with the hope that the next pair will be squeak free No luck I need another pair right now and I will not buy the monarch this time they are extremely comfortable and wear well but what a shame Nike can not fix the noise The 2 star rating is only because of the squeak

I ignorantly ignored the other reviews thinking the whole squeaking situation would not happen to me but it did After about 2 weeks of intense conditioning and training the squeaking began Every slight motion or movement you make with the shoes on makes this hellish unrelenting loud squeak I have been wearing these things for about a month and I am about to throw these things away and buy a completely new pair of shoes DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES These are without a doubt the worst pair of shoes I have ever owned They may fit well and are moderately comfortable but the squeak is so loud and obnoxious it ruins the shoe entirely Do not make the same mistake I did heed my warning

The Monarch III was better looking than the new one the silver swoosh ruined it The squeakiness is completely embarrassing They do not last very long either shoes should last for yearS not one year

These shoes are extremely comfortable howeverthey do develop a squeak after a while Ive noticed this in both shoes and its really quite annoying Another thing is that they do get pretty dirty I ordered the white ones I found the best way to fix it is to wipe them oof with leach overall they are good shoes but Nike really needs to fix teh squeaky problem

Please bring back the Air Definitions These replacement Monarchs are lower quality and fall apart quicker I actually grabbed an old pair of Definitions outta my closet that I wore for six months prior and they are more comfortable than the Monarchs I have worn for 2 months that are falling apart

Wish Nike would make more shoes for people with wide feet

Noticed the Squeaking very early on The shoe is very comfortable but i cant take the squeaky shoes in my quite office

Nike do you read these reviewsI have been buying your NIke Air shoes for many years because of comfort and durability and these have to be your worst effort yet The squeeking is so loud and annoying that I am ready to throw them out and switch to another brand

the shoes really are very comfortable but as so many other reviewers note it does not take long before they begin to squeak and then for the squeaks to become constant and maddening

I thought the first pair was a fluke however this last pair purchased 3 weeks ago has begun to squeak in the right shoe I have noticed that you can even make this noise by pressing in on the heal logo on the sole of the shoe Yesterday at an office I heard a familiar sound and looked down to find another person wearing the same shoes making the same squeak

These are very comfortable shoes and I have bought at least ten pairs over the years but the squeaks have gotten to me Used to be they would last a few months but the last pair was only good for 3 weeks I am sure Nike is well aware of this yet they have not fixed the product so I am done with Nike

this is the most comfortable shoe if you are on your feet all day but very squeaky the first pair started squeaking after a couple months I thought it was a fluke then the second pair started squeaking after only two weeks now I have to send them in and pay shipping and be out my shoes wow what an inconvenience I have bought nike my whole life thanks nike im not happy at all and will never buy this monarch again I see all the reviews are about squeaky shoes nike should fix this and make it right with all of us

I have bought Monarchin the past and have been very pleased These particular shoetend to squeak from the left shoe from the cushion under the front pad of the shoe I thought at first it was a defect in the shoe so I exchanged them and within 2 weeks I had the same problem Although the shoe is comfortable the squeak is very annoying and I would not recommend

Poor rating because of the squeek These are the most comfortable shoes when you walk a lot or on your feet BUT after a short time they squeek and it is pretty embarassing and annoying Nike should really fix this probably because what I see on reviewsI am not the only one that says these are the most comfortable shoes but will not buy them again because this is the 2nd pair I have bought and the first pair squeeked but thought maybe it was just an unusual thing but seems it is pretty much what everyone experiences NIKE fix this squeek so we can have our comfort back

I am on my feet all day at work literally 7 out of 8 hours These are the best shoes I have found They have stopped a lot of the pain that I have had in the past with other shoes I have had three pair of Monarch shoes and am ordering another pair tonight Never had a squeek except when coming in out of the rain After shoes dried they quit squeeking Gotta think that is more than luck however I will keep in mind the fix another person posted about with the 3 in 1 oil if I ever have the need

I first noticed the squeak at 2 months in 1 shoe At 3 months the other shoe also squeaks Now I am like the clown with horns on his shoes honking with every step it is awful I wish I had not bought them

I speed walk 20 miles a week These are the most comfortable shoes I have At two months they developed an unbearable squeak Store I bought them from would not take them back Online search showed this is a known problem with this shoe it is a shame because they are very comfortable and are wearing well Just can not wear them in public Would have been five stars except for the squeak

These shoes are very comfortable somewhat durable but the squeak is unbearable

I wear a 7 wide so shoes that fit are hard for me to find I am on my feet all the time as a college student and a custodian These shoes are super comfortable and have helped solve some of the foot problems I was having So far they have lasted 7 months of everyday wear and they are still working I have not had any problems with them squeeking I am definetly going to buy these again when my current pair wear out I just wish there were more color options in the wide maybe there is but they are just not available right nowI would love to have a pair of these in black

I started wearing Monarchs back in the 90s Pre Monarch II III and IV Original version NEVER squeaked I wore these original shoes for nearly 10 years 4 6 pairs without a squeak When Nike brought out the Monarch II they started to squeak The squeak is internal to the shoe construction and has been present in every pair I have purchased post the original Monarch These are the most comfortable shoes but the squeak is unbearable I do not know why they do not fix and why I keep trying buying these shoes I am returning my 30 day old Monarchs today

Got a pair of Air Monarchs about a week after Christmas By February I could not stand it any longer The shoes were squeaking so much that people knew I was coming and they would say here comes the IT guy at work So I contacted Nike sent back the shoes Turns out this must be a major quality concern for Nike because if you search on google for nike air monarch squeak you will discover that this is a BIG problem do not buy these shoes if you are a jewel thief you will get caught Something inside the soles are giving out But on the flip side they were extremely comfortable Glad I got rid of these

The iv version are solid and fit well at first they feel comfortable The only problem they squeek after 30 days especially if a little rain gets them wet I had several pair of Monarch iii and they did the same thing my guess its the bladder that holds the air squeek squeek annoying as it gets

I have solved the problem of the squeak 3 in one oil Take the inner comfort pad off and lube the inner area Line with some paper towel to soak up the extra oil and your done

Nice shoe SQUEAKS and Nike has know about this for some time but still seems to NOT fix the problem do a google search to verify this AND Nike wants to make ME pay for shipping to them

Just like the other review says the shoes SQUEAK When you are trying to sneak up on someone with the line of work you can not be wearing these shoes Bad thing is its past the 45 days to return them

Very comfortable Look Good Keep my feet dry in inclement weather Had to get rid of my first and second pair before their time due to squeaking Went to other brand but came back to try again Now about to throw away my third pair due to the loud squeaking noises they make when you walk even on carpeting You cannot wear these shoes in public once they start to squeak

Very comfortable But squeaks too much Returning it to Nike

I have owned several 4 pairs of these shoes I am on my feet 10 hours a day on concrete I can not find a more comfortable pair of shoes out there My only complaint is that EVERY pair has squeeked Some just one shoe but moist have been both shoes It does not matter what surface they squeek internally Please fix these shoes they are so comfortable for what I do

Very soft

These are good for daily use a little heavy but great and comfortable

I bought these for work and I am moving on my feet all day I am a sucker for retro style nikes and these looked durable They are on the heavy side of things Think Air Max 95 They are tanks compared to my air max 1Style is nice but the lace system is a little weird with only four lace holes on each side Took about two weeks to totally break in and actually feel the air max The look is a little busy from the top They seem very well made and for the price on here they are a steal

These sneakers pair very well with a nice Victoria Secrets Pink Sweatsuit for a nice casual day A nice athletic sneaker with a trendy appeal

It was the best shoes i have ever played in though would be too narrow but nopeCOMFORTABLE

Fits my feet like a hug and makes a visual statement

Size 9 5 These are very comfortable I have a somewhat narrow foot I usually wear a 10 for my everyday wearing shoes but I like a tighter fit when I play sports These never feel like they are about to come off even when I am pivoting as hard as I can The grip to the court could be better at the first but either I am getting used to it or they are getting better as I break them in cause it feels like the grip is getting better over time The compliment I have heard most is a variation of I like your space bootsThose look like space shoesetc The bright color usually draws some looks as well I am loving them so far

It just looks soooooo Good And also is really comfortable because the insoles and the outsoles are so soft

The shoes is far too narrow and the primeknit does not stretch to allow wide feet comfort This is not for guys wide feet but I love the design Sorry I will stick with my Propheres

easy to break in great fit best shoes over all so far best shoes to play basketball

Amazing comfort and fit even for a laceless shoe and for it to be for basketball it is amazing

Fits tight no blisters and great support and comfort

The shoes are too narrow and my foot did not fit

Probably my favorite fitting shoe I really do not know what everyonetalking about that they are hard to get your feet in like these people are straight bustin a sweat trying to put these on or something I mean its a nice snug fit but its not that hard cmon people

I love the design on these but it is hard to get your foot in the opening and I even bought a size larger and it is too small

Bought these shoes for casual wear not for playing basketball and they can be a bit difficult in that sense I went true to size and found them to be a little too narrow in the front causing uncomfortable compression of my feet and making it difficult to extend my toes upward I tried going half a size up but found that there was too much heel slip as a result I found a compromise of true to size with the insoles removed and that has been great for casual wear over the course of a day Definitely a little arduous to get on but once they are on they are not going anywhere

I love the design when I first found out on IG I bought it without hesitation The shoe is not letting me down It fits like compression socks and it is so freaking light that you do not even feel you are wearing a pair of basketball shoes This reminds me of the crazy light but it performs much better I am going to wear this pair for a long time and I am waiting for the next ADIDAS laceless basketball shoes

Adidas has made laces obsolete with the N3XT L3V3L shoesYes a little tight on the upper but the added pressure is needed for a basketball shoe with no visual or adjustable laces Still form fitting and comfortable enough to play and walk in A

Good shoe but tough to get on I was skeptical of the laces but offers decent support

Shoes were really supportive on the court and the ankle support

Super comfortable best arch support of any shoe want a second pair I just got mine and put them on first time By far the most supportive and comfortable shoes I have ever had on my feet In width I may have benefited from ordering half a size larger Otherwise I am ready to order another pair and hope they release more color ways of them

I was more than a little curious about a lace less basketball shoe and had to give them a try After about three weeks of use I am quite impressed The fit is right on very supportive and comfortable Great traction even on somewhat dusty floors Cool modern styling I get lots of positive comments

the shoe design itself is interesting enough to warrant a purchase but these are too supportive to wear as an every day or style shoe

I bought these to try out the laceless technology and I was thoroughly surprised I love the lockdown grip comfort and style No one knows what these are when I wear them at the gym The surprise when they realize the shoes are Adidas is hilarious I do not really wear high tops but these are cool

I love the look of the shoes BUT it is only made for people with narrow feet I am trying to find a solution for it on how to stretch it out So far its ok at first I couldnt even get it in looked through Youtube for solutions Is there anyone with any tips on how to make the shoes fit

Nice shoes and laceless cool shoes and comfortable

Futuristic in design and very stylish A bit narrow and can be difficult to get your foot in I recommend going a half or full size up depending on your comfort level Overall a decent shoe

i recommend this shoes very comfortable and very fashionable

Super comfortable great color I could wear them all day

These are wonderful to look at and sight see throughout the world They are so comfortable and I truly recommend FYI go up half a size Very happy customer

My only complaint is the sizing run small With these and all Huarache remember to order a 1 2 or full size up

love the color way Best pair of hauraches I have

I know the shoes looked comfortable but wow do they feel amazing once you put them on Definitely buying another pair different colors

These sneakers are sooooo comfy I love them very much I love the colors best sneakers

Best huaraches they are really comfortable and I really like the color on them really recommend getting this

First of all i Want to say is ComFortable Im a 41 years old up and about kind of guy I have a knee operation and The shock absorbency is amazing totally allows me to be out there walking for miles I know is a running shoe but I cant tell you that it is an amazing shoe over all I have purchased about four pairs in the last six months so I never run out them sincerely Lenny Alvarez

Great show Easy to clean Matches well with anything outfit

I have several pairs of Hauraches and these take the cake You can stand theses all day great summer colorway I got a size up which doesnt work for the mid strap Hauraches or the the south beach ice soul color way mid Hauraches

Fantastic awesome comfortable majority georgus shoddy

Its very cheap and affordable Great for summer shoes

The best white sneakers you should buy Not only are they fashionable they are very comfortable to walk and run in I would reccomend this shoe to anyone that need support on their feet or if you need run around shoes You wont complain about them at all

Great comfortable shoes runs half size smaller then normal so would recommend to order half size bigger

Great shoe Nice to have the Huarache in multiple colors

I love my sneakers They are very comfortable and stylish

They are rally good shoes and they are very comfy from the in side and do not worry about the spine breaking on them you can step on it without worrying it breaking and overall really great show

Very satisfied and pleased Name was not on box for

The MenNike Air huarache premium shoe is a great classic shoe Fit is about 1 2 to 1 size small so please make sure to go up in size like recommended Great colors and great shoe Have 6 pairs and counting

Great shoe for workout in but also great to wear for casual days

Sick liking shoes they are suede so Im guessingmight be difficult to keep clean

Ordered my normal size 10 5 received tried on and noticed they were a bit snug Especially when trying to put on and having the laces loosened all the way

Go a full size up My size is usually 8 5 so I ordered them a full size up 9 5 and they fit me perfectly good pretty good quality Im so happy with these sneakers

The huarache is one of the most comfy and plush shoes out there They come in a variety of color 10 10 would recommend

The shoe fits great Its very stylish and looks great with my Air Jordan jacket It is my go to shoe at the moment

Got these to walk around campus and they work great

The shoes run small so be sure to get a bigger size than normal I wear a 12 but a 13th in the huarache were perfect Amazingly comfortable and holds your foot like a sock

Shoe was exactly what I was looking for Great product

Serves its purpose Light and fashinable new look to an old favorite

Nice looking shoe with lots of comfort Older style look that never gets old

Love the fit and feel of this Nike tennis shoe I would clearly recommend it to anyone I can keep it on for hours and my feet remains comfortable

Great shoe for running snd training I got two pair

Runs very narrow Fits like a sock If you have a wide foot must try on to check fit

Love Nike love hurraches they are my favorite sneakers of all time Nike your the best

They are comfortable light weight and make you feel faster You can also wear them when ever and where ever

Super dope and comfortable order half size up

When I first got the shoe I tried it on and it fitted really good So I wear a 9 5 but in hurraches I got a 10 5 Overall great shoe good materials and nice colors and great for running

Had the shoe in no time True to size I would order from the site again

I have about four or five different colors of this shoe This shoe is comfortable lightweight and durable The other thing I like about it is that they are very fashionable as well I will always buy the shoes when they come out in different colors

I just love huaraches especially these ones These are possibly the most comfortable ones to date Keep keeping us satisfied Uncle Phil Knight

I ordered my Nike Harauches online they came very quick and in good shape I will definitely being purchasing more online the service and updates are awesome and your garaunteed the best quality Thanks Nike

I love the comfort of the shoe and I own several pairs of Huaraches

If you are looking for overall comfort this shoe has just that If you are looking for stylish this shoe has many styles to suit everyday attire

ITS AN AMAZING SHOE WITH ALOT OF HISTORY GREAT HEELand fRONT BALL OF FOOT COMFORT I LOVE HURACHED

A very comfortable shoe I always wanted a pair but never got around to getting some glad I finally got a pair love them

Quality was poor There was a lot of glue around the sole and a wierd white line between seams near the toe I ended up buying another pair from the mall and swapping them out Didnt want to deal with returning them

These are one of the most comfortable sneakers I have owned They do run a little small But after being broken in they were fine I would definitely buy another pair

Great fit just a tad smaller then reg size but over all great fit

Very comfortable shoes and affordable I use them on a daily basis recommended

Great looking shoe but not comfortable at all at least for me I tried to break them in but to no avail I could not get any comfort out of this shoe This limited me in comfort and distracted from my workout

Love these sneakers they are soooo comfortable Will buy another pair

10 out of 10 would recommend these shoes over close to any other shoe The comfort that you experience while this shoe is wrapped around your foot simply cannot be explained and you must experience for yourself It feels as if you were walking on a cloud made strictly of angels feathers and unicorn tears

They are comfy after you get through the small fit phase I am a size 12 in men and I ordered size 13 from reviews I read With thin no show socks they are super tight So with that size up if you can do a size up and 1 2 I advise do it I will see if stretching it by wearingmlonger might help but for now they are right fitting

These slides run SUPER small and tight Definitely size up

I would hate to say that this is the first time after purchasing several nikes that the quality of this shoe was beyond disappointing The excessive glue on the sole one tongue shorter than the other the list goes on

I stayed cautiously optimistic after reading other reviews but I am glad I chose to order them anyway These are great shoes and really comfortable I have not had any problems with the Velcro straps I kept other reviews in mind and I do not over tighten the straps Great shoes

I bought 2 pairs for my sonOne plays HS basketball and wears a 12 the other plays rec basketball and wears a 9 The son that plays rec only wore the shoes once and the right shoe Velcro strap kept coming undone during his game My other son has not had any issues at all with his shoes and he is played 15 games thus far So there seems to be some inconsistency in the manufacturing of these shoes

Wore them only on a court and the velcro would give out every game and the sole started to rip off only after like half the season

Overall very conf for the first month then I started getting a pain in the middle of my foot and the Velcro came loose every time I would step and my foot would flex Also they are not very breathable I suggest buying them fit basket ball and not casual wear

Straps work just fine you just have to tuck them in on the one side

Im having an issue with these shoes and it is pretty sad that my daughterteam chose to use them for their games I come to watch the game but unfortunately I am watching them strap the velcro more than play the game I have seen all the bad reviews these shoes have and Le Bron should be embarrassed to have some shoes out under his name with such bad reviews These shoes are a joke the strap needs more thought These girls need to be able to play without the worry of a strap coming undone

My son loves LeBron James basketball shoes I have been buying them for him the last few years This last pair I purchased only lasted one game before the Velcro gave out Now he carries electrical tape with him and tapes them up before the game Very disappointing

These Lebron Solider 12 are almost perfect They are very snug gives you traction and they are durable I have worn this shoe to practice yesterday I preformed better than I did with my previous shoe I will write a review a month later to let you guys know the true durability

I love Lebron James and I have been wearing his shoes on the court for a while now but this year when I purchased these they snapped on the first day of practice I love the way they look and while they take a while to break in they are always comfy when you dohowever one of the strap holders broke on the first day and is now being held together by a string which is not good looking in any way shape or form I would not purchase these shoes again unless I wanted to mount them on my wall and I definitely do not want that now

I love the colors and it fits great very lightweightIt hugs your feet Did a lot of walking and it was the best

Not the biggest fan of the shoe laces so replaced them easy enough but shoes fit great and can run around all day in them

Fits much more comfortably than the standard 270 The sole is a little narrow around the heal and middle of the foot but you get used to it and it doesnt make the shoe any less comfortable Fits true to size whereas i had to size up half a size for the regular 270s

Son loved them and he is not always easy to please with tennis shoes

I am not a sneakerhead or a shoe fanatic Recently I have been stopped and given so many compliments on the color and hoe well the shoes look on me I have been taken back a bit Glad I made this purchase

Not only are they eye candy but they feel amazing Very different feel than the Air Force 270s Personally I think they feel better than the Air Max 2013 14s I suggest if you are thinking of cop a pair to get up on them quick like

These shoes look great but my god my ankles rolled in immediately like my foot was slipping off on the insole Maybe because these are the flyknit version I will have to buy inserts to counter this Not a huge deal since these are not a performance shoe Other than that I do like the cushioning Zoom air still better though IMO

The flyknit gives more comfort and it is really good for just walking or lifestyle wearing

I am so happy that there is a fresh lifestyle silhouette other than the NMD and UltraBoost from adidas I am so tired of those shoes and adidas has been really milking out their popularity The 270 is the amazing shoe that I was waiting for The design is so fresh and newa well needed break from the now commonly found adidas lifestyle shoes that you see everywhere

Very stylish and comfortable Personally I think these feel better than the Air Max 2013 14 etc Much different feel from the Air Force 270s I own the White Racer Blue Total Crimson Black and the Work Blue Brave Blue Total Crimson White editions and would definitely recommend cop at least a pair Bouncy and purty will make you gain 2 in height wearing them

I personally really enjoy the Flyknit 270 to the normal mesh ones The only think I can recommend is to go down a half size They fit big Overall comfort is fantastic

Love the black flyknit version they are a lot less obnoxious and can be worn just about anywhere I usually wear a 10 5 in Nike Free Roshe and other flyknit running shoes but I am a 10 in these

I had to put inserts in these to make them fit just right Order a half size smaller unless you are ordering tight shoes already Super comfy though

The shoes look great and are very comfortable I can wear them all day with no problems

Very nice good look I recommend for guys look this price thanks



I bought these shoes out of my undying love for Kingdom Hearts and their uncanny resemblance to the main character Sorashoes from the second game I am keeping them for SO many reasons Every color option for this shoe comes in different materials so be aware that your results my vary The Laser Orange Black White color option is amazing The sole is VERY thick with a lot of cushion the most comfortable I have ever owned The materials above the sole are reminiscent of kevlar or nylon only on this color option just like a c and Ing tent or duffel back making them extremely durable but also extremely LIGHT Even as a boot the lightweight materials do not constrict or rub at my ankles at all letting them perform as running shoes if I wish without any problem at all The front toe section is coated with a rubberized material only on this color option that makes them resistant to scuffs and scrapes but still cut with dozens of breathing holes to keep your feet cool Excellent shoes that are definitely one of a kind

Great comfy fit straight out of the box black black black is very subtle I can wear them anywhere They take rough use and weather wear I use the secret pouches all the time Nit the cheapest but he best hi tops I have ever had

Just got yesterday and i love them Best180 i ever spent on shoes Getting 2 more colors the blue and tan and pink ones would love more colors but black and green the first color way is very nice

I bought one for my son at first and it was so comfortable according to him Then i tried it myself and i was sold so i bought two different colorways I wished they would restock on the white colorway on my size Anyway they feel great and comfy they do not slide on the foot bed and traction is good

I bought 2 pairs white and black of the Adidas Voloomix Sandals for a really good deal My son and daughter needed new pairs So when I saw this deal I jumped on it I am not sure if these run small but my sonsandals are a bit snug he is 13yrs old 511 and skinny wearing a men13 Bottom line they LOVE their Adidas sandals

I bought all three colors 2 for my son and 1 for my husband They both love them My son received many compliments when he wore the tan and white He loves the style and look as well as the comfort

I normally wear 9 5 but sandals only have whole sizes so I went half a size up to 10 It is roomy but not too slippery Very comfortable and looks nice too The only concern I have is the arch over the feet it looks like cotton material on the inside so I am not sure how it would hold up in the long term against water and in showers etc I imagine some dirt will build up

Automatically put my feet in these once I see them by the front door

A very comfortable Great deal for the price Would recommend

I like the slides because they were an unusual color After I broke them in they are now very comfortable

does not slip as much Nice Slip ons even better for the price

Very comfortable and stylish I love it I would recommend this shoe and the price was awesome

I liked it I will recommend to everyone

These are a great pair of Slides very comfortable I should have listened to others when reading the previous reviews The slides do run large I am normally a size 10 and these fit like an eleven So do order a size down from what you normally get

These are great looking sandals and comfortable too But I have to echo what others have been sayingThey are way too big I am a ten but should have ordered a nine I will be exchanging or returning them

This sandal looks and feels great however I had to send it back because my normal size 10 was too large So word of advise order a size down from your normal size

fits great for womensizes its recommended to go down two sizes for me one size was enough

They call these shower sandals but I use them to run out to the garage from the house and other errands like taking the garbage out feeding the dogs and checking the rain gauge Comfortable easy to slip on and off and weather resistant so even in the rain they work perfectly Maybe not your typical Adidas use but for me it is 5 stars

These are now my most comfortable shoes They slip on easily and are so light you could forget you had them on

Maybe its the shape of my foot but they feel funny after a while

Great look out of this world you wont be disappointed

Not very comfortable rough inside Would not buy again

I like these shoes a lot because they are very comfortable to wear and there not to tight I also like the color of the shoes

Super Comfortable fits perfect Definitely would recommend this shoe to a friend family member

I was skeptical purchasing these shoes at first because I was not sure how comfortable they would be even though the midsole looked like a big marshmallow Well those marshmallows help my feet stay comfortable while I stand on my feet for most of the day at work And surprisingly the unorthodox sole shape provides a decent amount of responsiveness during exercise and movement I do not recommend playing competitive basketball in them due to lack of good ankle support but a nice shoe to walk around in or exercise occasionally

I am just worried about the laces tearing up what isholding them in the future

Great shoes wish I had another pair super comfy great basketball shoes

Still is in very great shape unless you do not take care of them but overall nice color way and great Originals

Came in on time 2 days to ship 2 days to arrive and was neatly packaged with no signs of wear It was a pleasant surprise to see it with a good amount of boost and feels great when you put them on your feet

really clean design and odd definitely a fan of this silhouette

Yes These shoes are comfortable and have great ankle support

The design is really cool and the soles feel great My only issue is that my feet are just a little wide for a shoe this narrow However this is a really dope sneaker nonetheless

For the most part they were comfortable except for the fact hat there was no ankle support The lacing system was loose Then while playing in a basketball game the right upper inside panel on the outsole tore open seemed to be a defect in the boost overall a comfy but poorly created shoe

Still have to wear them in a bit to test the quality Awesome looking shoe looks better on foot Boost is soft and responsive Used them to hoop for a bit even though they are street sneakers and they actually performed pretty good outdoors

Boost feels good except for the tongue Wish the tongue would be softer

Got them for my 19 brother and he loves them

There is a slight flaw in this pair of shoes So it does not look so good

They are great shoes Highly recommend Super comfy boost Breathable upper

My husband really likes the different shoes Its color matching is in line with our aesthetics very special and comfortable

From a comfort and style perspective this sneaker is absolutely amazing The only issue is the white part of the sole that comes to the tip of the sneaker it appears to be a magnet for dirt I wish the bottom sole would have been all black leaving the boost as white

The Boost pods they put on these shoes are amazing I work 12 hour shifts and my feet NEVER hurt the entire time I am so glad I bought these shoes

Very interesting design Quality and materials are top notch

These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and on top of that they look so cool with jeans or track pants The boost is amazing it feels lime im walking on a cloud I could stand all day and not get tired My most favorite shoes ever

Light weight for the size of the materials Great bounce to the sole Very comfortable

I really like this he style of this shoe as it is a little futuristic and that is the look that I was going for when I made my purchase This style may not be for everyone but I really like it

Looks great Runs a little bit smaller than other adidas shoes I have purchased Still deciding if I want to try hooping in them not sure if the lacing system would hold up so great But just for everyday wear super comfortable and overall great purchase

I purchased these from the Adidas store in Deer Park New York and the staff there are the absolute best The BTW are like walking on clouds

Would not recommend not comfortable Very awkward shoe very little support

It is very comfortable and beautiful shipping soon good deal

They are very different on foot then just looking at them So comfortable

The boost is so amazing on these Super comfortable

If your looking for an all day shoe this is for you

Would recommend to anyone who has not tried boost

I see no reason why people are not rockin this it is one of the best boost sneaker out there with a great price

The sole is nice but the uppers do not quite seal around the top of the ankle The lace situation is more hype than function Probably a great walking around shoe

 xc3 xbaper confortable and great for daily life things

Great for hooping styling Incredible comfort and bounce

This shoe really surprised me I have been wanting to try a pair of these for a while and the amount of boost is unreal

This Crazy BYW is one of my favorite shoes that I own It is very comfortable I would say that the comfort level of this shoe is if not equal is just right next to the 93 17 This shoe may look like a basketball shoe but i will suggest to not play ball with it because it do not have any kind of support in it It is more of a casual lifestyle shoe than basketball shoes

they are the most comfortable shose in the world

Very comfortable pair of sneakers and they look great

This shoes are comfortable and also good for girls

Real cool product its something that you do not see everyone wearing which makes it unique for me would definitely purchase again and i cant wait to purchase other products

Great shoe great boost A little too tight but overall great

not good for play basketball because that is too loose

Cushion feels like pillows Only gripe is the upper material is flappy and kinda sloppy The lacing is not ideal either but for casual wear in the gym it gets the jobxe2 x9c x85

these looking amazing on breathable and comfortable

Bought these shoes for work since I am on the go all day the boost on these is so comfortable and I have zero foot fatigue after a full day of wearing them Would definitely recommend these if you are on the fence

Love the design and comfort is great too I like how it feels like I am walking on air

I like the product because it is very comfortable

Love these shoes Super comfortable with 2 5 inches of boost almost twice as much boost as the Ultraboost They call these crazy for a reason

Not sure why requiring minimum characters in review comment

The shoe is very lightweight I really like the hodgepodge of fabrics and patterns Allows me standout amongst the sea of Jordan sneakers Idk how well this shoe is on the basketball court bc of the design of the laces and eyelets but for casual wearing they are as comfortable as house socks

Brought shoe was a little too small But otherwise they are pretty nice for the cost

Recommend this product very light and comfortable

A really great shoe is comfortable goes with most styles but my only complaint is the lacing system Because it is so wide across the shoe the shoe wrinkles You can try to tie them tighter but the wrinkles are still prominent

Once shoes are broken in they are very comfortable

I am a big fan of the overall appearance of the shoe the comfort of the shoe is a plus as well especially over long periods of time standing on my feet My feet did not hurt or get fatigued at all and with the different pods on the mid and outsole I could feel an immediate difference from an ULTRABOOST yeezy or I 5923 which I own multiple pairs of And seeing this is my first byw I have purchased I will be buying more

I have been looking for the shoes for me and finally got the answer

This pair of shoes most probably will make you fall on the floor if you are running

The Deerupts have to be one of the best shoes made by Adidas I numerous Adidas Alphabounces and NMDs which are amazing shoes but the Deerupt beats both shoes in comfort

Really like the style very unique funky looking shoe My work requires me to be on my feet on a concrete floor the comfort of these shoes are up to the task

Not as good as i hoped Especially for the money Not the support wed hoped for in a basketball shoe The pictures also look better than the shoe

The shoe is extremely lightweight and has good grip They are also very stylish on the basketball court

My only complaint is the plastic plate that was connected 2 the suede was ripped totally disconnected from the shoe

Been playing basketball in these and have been killing it They help my drip and my swag Been shooting lights because of these Nobody can guard me They are CRAZY

So much boost is packed into this sneaker that it feels like you are walking on clouds

Shoe is very comfortable but a lil small not a big deal cause they are still comfortable Style and price were awesome

this shoes are definitly comfortble I like it so much

I do not like The shoe is too big by me I want return the shoes Give me the money back thanks

yes I do like it ITS COMFY AND I ENJOY IT EVERYONE GIMME COMPLIMENT

The big name is enough Adidas is the best

I was not sure what to expect until I received it but I got to say I am impressed Comfortable and stylish I totally recommend it

I have been watching these for quite some time These are not in stores where I live so it was hard to make that decision to order because I rotate between a size 13 and 14 with adidas depending on the shoe and did not want to be disappointed if they were either to small or too big but I got the 14 and could not be happier It fits perfectly This shoe is amazing and the comfort level is by far one of the best boost shoes I have had PERIOD The quality and materials of the shoe are great as well and I will most def be buying another pair in the near future

It looked like a type of Jordan and since Im only loyal to adidas I wanted to see how they would look But I was blown away by the level of comfort aside from the cool look

Love these cuz they are so comfortable to hang around in I would not do more than hang out in these since they are so spongy Great price and great boost

The BYW is probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn Easy transition form casual to athletic On the basketball court there was no feelythat the shoe lacked support necessary for quick stops or changes in direction EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT I can not express that enough Overall extremely happy with the buy and the experience

Feels like walking in space literally like I am on the moon Crazy comfortable

Just got the sesame CW The shoe itself is great and the materials are top notch but I am considering returning because they were packaged carelessly They arrived completely bent out of shape creased all over and there are already scuffs on the suede I would expect much better from adidas especially for such a nice shoe Otherwise they are great Great boost and very HQ suede The only thing to note is that you cant really wear them with anything other than joggers or track pants Even super skinny jeans seem to bunch up with these

This product is awesome that is it It looks so good on foot and brings a lot of looks I get questions about them all the time and everyone loves them They are so dope

Very comfortable great fit and love the look Totally recommend

I like these shoes a lot but if I wear them for a long time they can get uncomfortable on my feet

Bought the Crazy BYW for the wife and is loving it The shoe has so much BOOST so comfortable and stable She loves wearing it loves the way it looks on feet more than her Ultra Boosts but only cones 2nd to her Triple White Yeezy 350 V2s With everything said my family does not have any plans on going back to the check mark brand As the saying goes BOOST IS LIFE

Seriously big fluffy sock is a very good description

These are extremely comfortable having a few different colorways of this shoe its definitely comfortable One gripe about it when lacing it up something I do not usually do Ultraboost etc the material doesnt stay laying flat which causes it to look at bit strange on the medial side of the shoes

I got these shoes cause I really liked the style Great for walking around the city However they are not the most comfortable shoes The sole is designed to look round yet at times it feels bulky when you are walking around which makes it uncomfortable for long walks I also do not like the shoelaces They are strapped in a way that makes the shoe tongue look weird when fastened These are things that I notice I still like these shoes very much and have gotten lots of compliments with them

Bought these online my dude Really comfortable I stand a lot so when everyone else is complaining about how tired they are I have no idea what they are talking about The individuals that notice my shoes they express how much they like them and would like a pair of there own can not blame them for wanting something like this

different feel from ultra boost but still very comfortable my only issue is I think the shoe needs a better more gel like insole set up do the the way the boost is split up

Awesome shoes lite comfy great looking I am super happy with design as well

Good Looking and comfortable shoes and my kid loves it

Weird Bounce to them when you walk Seems a bit unfinished still love the look

I had a pair of crazy 8in the mid 90and thought they were some of the weirdest shoes then Amazingly 20 years later and Adidas is still keeping it weird These things are crazy comfortable with Boost which is the only type of sneaker I will purchase as long as it is available but with the weird pod sole and thick plastic arch support you feel like you are walking on the moon Only real complaint is the tounge is suede and not padded and therfor it is super easy to tie your laces a bit too tight from a comfort level Hoping they do an all black model at some point which I will cop in a heartbeat

This sneaker is a unique design Very fresh and futuristic

Ever since the byw came out I have been wanting a pair But I was never in love with any of the colors This pair however is super clean it is boost seems super bouncy Which I think is because the boost has more room to move

they are really comfortable and very unique I highly recommend it if you are looking for an exotic style

Comfort level far surpassed my expectations Love the shoe

Very comfortable and flexible The soles of the sneakers are very unique

i know this shoes kinda looks weird but believe me its an awesome alday wear anywhere shoes its design makes it more cool than the rest let the truth be told nothing comes close to boost when it comes to comfort

Love the look Wish it were the all yellow version

I got these because they remind me of 3 sneakers A cool amazing look less the huge size rice tag These are a cool shoe and I have received tons of compliments on the unique look of these definately part of my weekly rotation comfort is great after the first wear they are a bit narrow yet fit true to size

The shoe is lightweight a nice snug fit good stable grip Fashionably diverse can wear anywhere on any occasion

I overall love my Crazy BYW shoes The color way is quite attractive and works with a variety of outfits I have received several head turns wearing these out and about The Boost throughout the sole makes each step have a delightful bounce and makes tapping your foot a comfortable experience My only complaints are that the shoe is a tad bit narrow and that the mesh in the toe box allows a little moisture to come in when it is raining out

These sneakers are incredibly comfortable on the basketball court Use mainly indoors but are equally as impressive out doors can not wait to try new color ways

These are very comfortable and I love how these standout with the colors going on and the extra boost They are kinda slippery on tile The quality could have been better but it was acceptable for the price These are by far my favorite pair of adidas I own simply because of the design the style just grabs my attention

Nice design The shoes 1 2 size too small I am waiting on my new size to come in Also there was glue on the toe of the shoes

The shoe feels premium all around Looks great on foot and definitely one of the most comfortable sneakers I have own The silhouette definitely grabs attention as well

This is the most slept on color way of this shoe I think this might be up there with some of the comfiest pairs of boost shoes that exists out there besides of course the UB and the 350 

I ordered size 10 5 as usual for Boost shoes but these were super roomy to the point I had to return The lacing and random cords around the shoe were weird and something I would probably snip off but the overall quality was excellent The stretchy fabric in the toe box was sturdy the stitching was on point and the boost speaks for itself They are very boosty 

Feels like your on a yacht of boost Stylish and comfortable One of the best boost shoes ever

The byw are super comfortable and light enough for the type of shoe they are A little thin for someone with a wider foot like me but still very comfortable

Comfortable and looks good Great price for the shoe as well

Purchased the black and white Crazy byw and had to get the whites Crazy comfortable and gets the right attention Must haves

Plush ride I do not think they would be great for basketball for some people I mean I would But these are definitely a casual shoe Fit is great and TTS for me Lockdown seemed alright even with that unique heel shape on the upper If I find another CW with the same  or discount I would guarantee I am copping it

Great materials good comfort laceing system is a bit weird Cant complain for the price I got them for

This is a great looking and feeling shoe the only issue for me was the quality on the bottom the glue is not the toughest or most durable but other than that the shoe is great for my taste

Probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn The boost on these shoes are crazy Adidas definitely payed attention to detail especially with the different textures on the sneaker Very versatile with different outfits

if you are detail oriented do not get these shoes if you are about the overall look and do not care if you yourself know there is a scuff or a loose thread somewhere get these they are like chuky y3s and they are great for the court otherwise pass

I am so disappointed that I want to exchange this shoes for a pair of ultraboost ATR I just do not know how Pleases help me

Like the boost on it top could be a little more comfortable

Very comfortable Feels like I am on planet namek I would definitely recommend

Comfortable while standing a lot especially for work

These shoes look fire on feet Whoever copped congratulations and to those who did not you all sleeping on these crazy boosts 

While I am a little concerned that the strings holding the laces down might break in the future I really liker these shoes

For those people that know knows and the people that do not know get with the game one word adidas for all your shoes needs

These shoes are so amazing comfort beyond my wildest expectations Every time I put them up it is like I am wearing them for the first time

as always adidas bring great product to the consumers always getting the good brand thankz adidas

love the materials and most of all the midsole boost pods I get positive attention when wearing these can not wait for more colors to drop

I am a first time owner of any adidas and I have to say for the first time in my life I get to say boost is life I had to buy the white pair Definitely will recommend

As above xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Was looking for something different and I do not regret this purchase They are both comfy and stylish BUT they are not instant comfort like regular boosts or I owns Instead your foot is molded to the boost

The pods under foot feel a bit weird kind of do not feel leveled with the ground The fit is TTS but a slightly snug TTS I personally think the silhouette is fire others may not agree

Excess glue on both pairs Sole toe cap very sloppily put together

it is a very comfortable shoe that is perfect for my wife feet They have ankle support that allows me to play basketball and the boost makes them comfortable to walk around in all day They also look a little better in person than in the pictures

Excellent looks needs better insole or midsole If you have normal or wide feet it feels awkward when you walk Needs more stability or you will trip

Love the fit love the comfort Awesome shoe Recommending it to everyone

While hooping abrupt stops makes my feet slide inside the shoe I just wish they had like a solid leather panel around the lower part of the foot to control the inside sliding The show is awesome though very good on comfort

Not a fan of the way this shoe fits or looks Still love boost

Great and comfortable shoe but laces are poor quality and I feel it is a bit too loose

I had the shoes back in high school and they were comfortable then with the added boost pods I think it is even more comfortable now only downside is that it is a lifestyle shoe not meant for basketball no ankle support at all but as a lifestyle shoe for looks and comfort it is great

Like the shoes look very nice and great comfort Only problem was glue and traction

it is got boost comfier than the Ultra and they look fly

Upon receipt my pair was definitely not brand new They were not packaged quite the way I know deadstock is

I really like this colorway Very comfortable shoes but a little bit hard to wear on the daily Mostly because of the style

it is stylish and I like it but I am not sure about front area strength near the toe

At first the plastic arch support was too narrow probably because I have wide flat feet But after a couple wears it forms to your foot and is super comfortable

These shoes are great they fit comfortably just as I thought they would and they look even better in person

I was sceptic at some point before buying them but i like these crazy style kind of shoes When i opened the box i was like wow they look better than the pictures Very comfortable and soft The Boost is so squishy They need to loosen up a bit for this size but they are ok They are not the kind of shoes that deform with size they just look the same on any size3stripesstyle

These shoes compare greatly to any of the high fashion uglyhype sneakers that are all the rage right now but for half the price

Amazing fit style quality overall great sneakers

I can wear these anywhere

These shoes are awesome by the way not at all knocking the shoe If it had a bit more stability or maybe make it a little wider in the mid foot white thing lol But if it had those fixed straight up this would beat ultraboost no joke Only thing adidas plz plz adidas do not be afraid forget the haters any throw a pound of boost next time I kept hearing these had mountains of boost and in a sense it does but I was expecting that but got kinda that it is hard to explain But it is awesome comfortable just wish you put it like the eqt how that actually rounds under your feet but these are like shaped like the ultra boost But not even kidding because the harden vol 2 has boost but like has something over taking it away But yes these need even more boost come on adidas just give us hills inside and compensate by making the upper higher the eqt was awesome but really tight upper So please adidas meet in the middle Even if it is just for casual not performance is fine God bless hope this helps

Ive since returned them and still have no boosts

I ordered these for my son who wears an 8 5 in mens He has a little room at the toes but at his age that is a good thingroom to grow He put White bungee lances on them and now he just slides them on and off This shoe is made from high quality materials You will not be disappointed

Unique looking Different kind of comfort because of the decoupled outsole Premium materials Only complaint is it should have been a one bootie upper instead of traditional seperate tongue Runs true to size Wide footers should not have too much of a problem with this shoe

byw are super comfortable Love the quality and appearance I can not wait for basketball version Thanks Adidas

Adidas has plenty to choose from between comfort and lifestyle wear Perfect combination

And it is not a basketball shoe is a casual wear out

Very versatile very comfortable and a very wise choice

Different lots of boost Make your feet like your walking on air

Took the shoes straight out of the box and very unimpressed with the quality Glue issues and shoes are not as clean as they can be Was going to play basketball in them but I am just so unimpressed Comfort Is crazy but quality is not there

I do not play basketball I have only worn them two time how is this happening I feel like I need another pair of shoes I have not ran or nothing

I was immediately interested by the style of this model and being a fan of boost it was a must have They are extremely comfortable for any situation I work on my feet all day and love them

Love the new byw model Super compfy and just looks so dope A must cop My only complaint is I wish it did not have the weird looking thing on the heel but you get used to it Fit is TTS

If you buy any new model this year buy this one This shoe is completely different in style fit and comfort Unlike other boost models where although you are comfortable you feel like you are sort of sinking the boost in this shoe really feels like it is elevating you It does not feel like you are touching the ground with these shoes Not as supportive as an ultraboost but definitely a shoe I can wear all day The shoes look amazing on feet and definitely breaks necks which is crazy to say about a GR Bottom line Comfortable different and crazy

Loved the sneaker can not wait for more pairs to release

the amount of boost on the shoe is insane feels like I am walking on clouds

I bought the preorder thinking they were basketball shoes but they are not Super comfy beautiful and gave me the nostalgic feeling of Kobe first line of adidas I ended up returning and I am waiting on the actually basketball version to come out

Stylish and comfortable One of the best boost shoes ever

One of the best newer silhouettes from adidas The materials comfort and style are beyond what I could have expected So excited for more colorways to come

The BYW has some quality control issues with the gluing the fit it is a little narrow and the lacing system is strange Even laces tight they are too loose in the heel

These look cool but are NOT comfortable IMO The toe box is tight and not comfortable You must go a half size up in these The materials are all really nice But after being spoiled by Ultra Boosts these are a torture chamber on feet

These are more comfortable than any Nike sandals I have owned including the Jordans

The sole was comfortable but the slide was too narrow Had to squeeze my foot in every time

Bought these for my boyfriend because he kept complaining about wanting a pair like my cloudfoams for women Long story short he loves them and they fit perfectly he is a 10 5 11 and the 11 fits him perfect

If you are looking for a comfy pair of slides then this is the one to go for

First time buyer from the website Comfortabl slide

I own these slides in a few different colors The memory foam bottom makes them so much more comfortable than others I wear them a lot With socks At the beach At the pool To the store And the quality has held up well so far Thanks adidas

Perfect exactly what I wanted I would buy again

Very comfortable and stylish I am thinking about buying a 2nd pair

 Sensorykidsloveadidas

Very comfortable slides Great for doing chores I am a size 9 in ultra boosts nmds I read the reviews saying the sizing was small and ordered a size 10 US Fits great

So so comfortable after my tried my on they wanted to get some to

Bought them as a gift to my husband and he loved them He says they are the most comfortable slides shoes he has ever had

Super comfortable less shock to shins compared to other sandles

Very comfortable highly recommended for everyone I bought 2 pair

Uncomfortable and narrow did not like them squeezed my toes

Cloudfoam is super comfy and make my feet feel like they can relax The all black goes with everything in my closet While they are slightly big I feel like my feet can spread out

These material of the shoes absorbs water The water will come out continuously and makes the shoes very watery

Look and feel great got great online reviews from many buyers

I had a pair of these that my boyfriend kept stealing so I bought him a pair and he is super happy

I wore these when I was in Cabo walking back and forth from pools the spa and to my room these were super comfy yet had awesome grip when walking on slippery pavements

it is comfortable and the all black color matches almost everything you wear

Not the same as the old cloud foam slides from adidas These are made of rubber like material No extra padding or cloud foam outside the soles Very simple basic

The comfort is next level By far my favorite pair of slides Highly recommended

I do not like the slides They cut the top of my foot

These slides are so comfortable I wear them all the time My feet are happiest when they are in these

Cloudfoam on these slides are a genius move Along with easy light materials this is an awesome pair of slides The material does start to show wear and tear after a couple of months though but should be expected

the best sandal I ever have I recommend this product

These are the most comfortable Adidas slides I have worn

These slides are easily the most comfy slides to ever bless my feet Feels like I am walking on some all natural sweater pups Thanks for the perfect amount of squish for my feet

I love this product because it is great to change into after a workout or match

Heavy duty slides Especially loving the sleek minimal design

I like the look and feel The comfortability I like the color gray with the stripes you can walk around with the sliders with some nice shorts or some nice linen

These slides are so comfy I like wearing them around the house because they give my feet so much support

I have always worn flip flops these are my first pair of slides the first thing I noticed was how solid they looked and felt After trying them on They are so much more comfortable then I imagined they would be I wear 10 half shoes and got size 11 and they seem to fit pretty well

I recommend these to anybody wholooking for comfortable slides it is difficult to go back to wearing shoes when these feel like walking on a cloud

I highly recommend this slide its very light in weight and super comfy

Great style exceptionally comfortable Would definitely recommend

My boyfriend loves these slides They are so comfortable Also the design is simple but stylish

Probably the best slides on the market Easily the most comfortable sandal or house slipper you could buy Cloudfoam is pretty much like an awesome memory foam mattress for your feet Highly Recommended for lounging around

These are essential Built tough while seeming sleek in design

These are the most comfortable flops I have ever had

They are very comfortable and were a big help to my injured Achilles

Love it also would love to get the swift run barrier shoes in black size 12 plz contact me when available Thank you

These are the worst slides I have ever purchased The cushioning under the foot is very good however the top strap has a poor design that caused excessive rubbing on my upper foot and toes After walking about 200 yards I already had nimberous blisters I would return these if I could Horrible

The comfortable and cushy it is from the inside of the sandal

One of The most comfortable sliders sandals I have ever worn Lots of Kristen feels like you are walking on clouds They do run slightly large you may want to consider one size down

I like how soft they feel and the all black is nice and low profile

Spot on with the cloud name Extremely comfortable My feet thank you

I like these and wear them all over the place comfortable for slides

Adidas sandals have always been good I am happy with these but they do run a size small

I love cloudfoams I ordered a pair of slides for myself and decided to order them for a friend as well Unfortunately when I reviewed the package the slides did not even come in an Adidas box like mine did The slides came in a clear plastic bag just thrown into the brown box Another thing is the right slide feels much more cushion than the left shoe My slides feel really mushy where as the ones I ordered for my friend do not Not too sure if that is how the shoe fits but I was not too pleased with the second pair I ordered

This sandal seems like it is made with quality and should last

they are comfortable I can not wait to wear them in the summer

Size is half size smaller

The cloud foam feels like walking on comfort pillows

Very fashionable product and lowkey also feels comfortable

It is very comfortable and stylish I would def buy

Great fit and comfort and durability and I recommend them to family and friends

Name Cloudfoam fits perfectly for the product This has the making of a best seller slipper only if you can come out new designs Those simple colors ar nice but what if adidas can come out design your own or exciting new colors

I wear them everyday Would buy again if they broke

I like everything and hate nothing Great shoes at a great price

I bought a whole size up and it was still too small

I bought my regular size and they run a bit big but not to the point where they are floppy I wear them with socks but without socks they are still comfortable Cloud foam are my favorite from adidas

I really recommend this product so comfortable and high quality

After a long day of work or when you get done with playing your sport these are the most comfortable slides to put on and lounge around in The quality is great aswell

These are the most comfortable slides in the market

The padding under the tongue like the explorer slides other than that amazing perfect comfort slides

I like it but 9 normally fits and they slide off I think I would need an 8

Quality is great and fits good price is fair for the item

I love everything except the water resistance They are light soft and comfortable They look great and match everything The only downfall is that I can not use them around water because they dry extremely slow They stayed wet for 12 hours in my bag after using them post shower Still I would buy them for other uses

The cloud foam makes the product very comfortable as well as the product being slides they are light and easy to wear

Very comfortable and affordable Convenient for an everyday wear

I FEEL LIKE THE QUALITY ON THESE SLIDES COULD have BEEN BETTER ESPECIALLY WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BAND THAT GOES ACROSS THE TOP OF YOUR FOOT OVERALL THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER SLIDES THAT I HAVE PURCHASE STYLE WISE AS WELL AS COMFORT WISE

Comfortability Color Design Size which was a perfect fit

Like that it is very comfortable and very versitile

I did not like this product because it is not comfortable at all It is not that soft as it is supposed to be

Very comfortable and so soft Love to wear these everyday

They are Very comfortable They look good and are good quality

Honestly feels like I sink into these

These slides are the most comfortable slides I have ever owned The comfort is amazing no other slide I have worn even compares

The sandal is super comfortable for around the house I would love to have one that has a thicker sole to wear outside

The fitness center I belong to in Illinois sells this and similar Adidas slides for people to use in the shower room After buying it I noticed that it and all the other styles of Adidas slides they had have a tag attached with the following messageNot for shower useThe website does not mention that little detail

this is for myself and love the color and the fit but most of all i love the cushion to me it is better than boost

recommending to everyone

Super comfortable I bought one for me and my husband Best slides we had so far

Super plush super comfy I use them as house slippers Really glad I purchased these

These are the best most comfortable slides you will ever buy These are perfect for lounging and they feel like you are walking on clouds I do wish there were options for half sizes but I got an 11 and they still fit great

It is just as expected It is really comfy and practical

Great comfort Best slide I have ever owned Very comfortable The Grey slide seems to be softer on top of feet Material is like a memory foam

They are very comfortable but mine are a little big because they do not come in half sizes but other than that they are great

I bought these for my whole family Training or not these are very comfortable to walk around in

Great pair of slides that I bring to the pool and beach

Awesome pair of slides Easy off and on and very comfortable

The fit was a little larger than normal so go down 1 size in what you usually wear in a slide Everything else is great about this slide Comfortable stylish and good quality

Great quality sandal but unless you have paper thin feet these will not fit I have to return for my boyfriend

They are so comfortable I am obsessed with them I do not ever want to take them off I would 100 recommend purchasing them Kong

The best ever i like how they feel very nice you have to buy it so nice

These slides are out of this world

From the simple appearance this slide does not seem too fancy However the cloud foam cushion is the most comfortable cushion for any slide out there it is better than the memory foam because it does not wear down or fatigue I have had a pair in black for almost 2 years and it is still just as comfortable as the new pair I just bought

it is just okay had more comfortable slides from other reputable brands

just like walking on cloud this is my 5th pairs and i am gonna keep buying this with different color

Very nice Good comfort Lasts for about 100 days of wear

Nice look very comfortable but get a half size smaller they run big

Very comfortable and light weight feels like you are walking on a cloud

True to size and very comfortable for around the house and For casual wear

I like them for comfort and style I bought some for the whole family

Very comfortable and goes with everything Item came very quickly

The shoes will mold into your foot the more you wear it

Product seemed to be made cheaply and rubs on my toes and top of feet very uncomfortably it caused a little blister on the top of my foot and it is not bareable to walk in these unless you have socks on Do not recommend

My friend recommended these since I was looking for some slides and these were prefect They are so comfortable

I bought 2 pairs as a gift to my hubby and son They keep commenting about how much they love the shoes I ordered size 9 for my men who wear regular shoes in size 9 1 2 to 10 1 2

I have three sports scandal cuz I feel comfortable as long I walk someplace I wear all day I love it

A gift for my son he loves them Very comfortable lightweight and perfect fit

These are sooo cheap knowing how comfy they are Totally worth the price

I tried these on at the store and they had the most comfortable footbed I have ever experienced Very cushioned yet supportive I like the all gray color At first my husband said they were bulky and the design and color were not very attractive but after he tried them on he said he has thinking about ordering some for himself because they are so comfortable

The material is firm but when your feet is on there it is cushy and so comfortable I bought one for myself and I bought one for my wife Now daughterkeep taking her slips so I will have to go get them some

This is my 2nd pair of sandals by Adidas They are well built and are VERY soft I highly recommend these shoes

Very comfortable to be at home and on the go I recommend it

Comfortable light cute love the color And give another pair to my mom

I did not like the style of the slider Also were not that comfortable

Best slides ever Soft comfortable Love the mono

Best quality price my son and husband love it

Very comfortable and lightweight and like the look

The advertisement looked like it would fit but the shoe was much too small for my feet The sizing chart was not as accurate as I would have wanted

Love these sandals Feels like walking on clouds I got these for Christmas and loved them

it is the absolute most comfortable slide I have worn

These are a go to after long run Bought multiple pairs All great but recommend sizing up

Super comfortable with great fit Material is durable and light weight

These would have been perfect but the tops should have velcro so they are adjustable for wider feet Unfortunately they did not work for me so I will be sending back

Super soft and comfy for every day slides Would buy again

Very comfortable Nice quality All black with no logo

My husband thinks these are super comfortable and fit him perfect

I have owned many pairs of slides from all brands and I must say that these are far superior than any other slides on the market For the comfort and style you get for the value is unmatched They fit perfectly and snug The cloudfoam is out of this world and simplistic look truly stands out I highly recommend these for athletes and for the average joe In my opinion the greatest slide Adidas has produced

Love this slider Very comfortable and true to size

The Cloudfoam footbed feels really soft out of the box I have not worn them much yet but they appear to be fairly durable

The cloudfoam is super soft and springy They fit like gloves and run TTS Highly recommend these

I sat by a heaters and before I knew it my slippers was in a different shape I would love to get them replaced with another pair

Just what i wanted very comfortable they feel amazing

Overall was happy how comfortable these Slides are I am buying another pair

These slides are so comfortable Feels like I am walking on clouds

My favorite slides due to the comfort I am normally a size 9 1 2 10 in women and ordered size 7 in men and the fit is perfect because I know they give a bit more the more I use them My previous pair I had bought a size 9 in women but since they stretch a bit next time I will get 8 in women Either way happy with both purchases

the most comfortable slide on the market great recomendation by ohitsteddy

Buy with confidence I love the softness and design

Stumbled over the slippers a couple times bc the top easily folds over Very comfortable though

I wore these to a Spartan race in October and 3 other people ended up wearing them or trying them on for various reasons but everyone was losing their minds about thr level of comfortable

Unbelievably comfortable Better than my previous slides Love them

The super cloud foam is hands down the most comfortable

very comfortable a big fan of the triple black colorway normally a size 9 but ordered a size 8 so keep in mind that they run big

Great slides super comfortable and looks great with everything

Super comfortable and look amazing for casual wear

Great slide for everyday wear and looks great as well

These slides are so comfy it is a must get for literally everyone

The cloudfoam is very comfortable Wish it was in more styles

Love them so much I bought a few different colors

They are super comfortable could not ask for a better product Thank you

The previous version of this slide had foam padding on upper and thus was more comfortable This product is OK but not exactly what I expected

Sizing is different than other Adidas products and it does not fit correctly The width is odd also because the width of the base is fine but the straps are much smaller

Nice soft shoe and fit Easy to wear and great I would bye another on in a great color

This was an amazing holiday purchase Never had a more comfortable pair of slides

Best slides ever worn fits great great price fast delivery

Awesome sandals Glad you got them Kind of wish I got the grey with white stripes though

Really Comfortable so soft walking on a cloud I wear them everyday

Probably the best pair of slides i have purchased to date

My son has long feet but slim He is usually a size 10 5 but it did not come in halves so he opted for size 11 but it was a bit loose

I was just looking for a plain black sandal and I am so happy I found these They look exactly like they do in the photos and the name Cloudfoam is more than fitting

My grandson practically wears only slides These are his favorite

there slides are great Simple and the dark color will keep the slides looking their best Bought a pair for my husband and teenage son both solid black

The cloud foam makes it feel like I am stepping on my bed

Comfy look great materials are well made could not go wrong

Product was great In good condition and very comfortable

Soft and light weight Perfect to take on vacation

Sleek and comfortable I can not travel anywhere without them

Feels like walking on cloud I need to buy a few more

Mine felt so great I bought a pair my dad and brother

They are so good Someone ask me if they could have then and I just could not share

perfect best slides I have ever bought have 5 pairs everyone in family has at least 1 pair

 stripesoverchecks all day

I really love these slide and how they feel on my feet They are so comfortable and really take a load off of my feet after a long day of walking It feels as if I was walking on clouds I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for really comfortable slide but keep in mind that they do kind of run a 1 2 size large So if you wear size 10 you should get size 9 5 for a better fit

it is like walking on a cloud Look great can wear with anything

Bought for my son for xmas so not sure how they hold up but had him try them on and he fell in love with the comfort

By far the best slides I have ever owned I have now bought my girlfriend and my dad a pair as well Who is nextHaha

One of the best slides I have A must buy own for everyone

great sandals for many occasions can use for sports or just around the house cloufoam on bottom is awesome

Comfort and stuly are amazing There is no sandals that even comes close

Its looks good and its comfy I like the all black color

I like the softness of the footbed and understated style

Great comfort a little tight around the toes initially but it fits my overall feet well The soft rubber is really flexible as well

These are the most comfortable slides ever I bought two pairs

Must have for anyone in athletics Super comfy especially after wearing athletic shoes gawd Simply awesome

Amazing quality and very soft Plus who does not love black slides

These are the most comfortable slides After a long day these help with rest and recovery

The idea of having cloudfoam technology on slides is like having boost

Love these slides They are the most comfortable shoe slide I have ever worn I can not take them off I just purchased another pair because I never want to be without these I will always have a backup If you are thinking of purchasing these DO IT You will not be sorry True to size I am a women size 9 and purchased men size 7 perfect fit

Just a little wide And now I know adidas runs a little big

The monotone color is appealing The CloudFoam is comfortable I like them

This slide is the most comfortable I have ever worn Recommend getting a half size larger

These slides are basic but perfect Nothing fancy but the fit is right and very comfortable

They are very comfortable I like the look and feel of this product

Sandal sliced my side of my foot The sandal is soft but stopped wearing after second time due to sandal slicing my foot because it was so narrow Very disappointed

Very comfortable to wear and perfectly fit on my feet

Everything is good except the front of the top strap it is really thin and somewhat sharp so it digs into my toes when I walk

These slides are super comfy and affordable I would buy another pair in different color

Make Flip Flops for people with wide feet These are way to narrow

I was skeptical when i heard that these slides would be the most comfortable on the market So i ordered a pair and fell in love i will say however go true to size for more narrow feet and up half a size for wider feet My feet fit perfectly but next time i order a pair Imma order half size up

Comfortable but the material already started to go bad for some reason I only wear these in the house

It feels like you are walking on pillows and lightweight

These slides are like walking on heaven The look is perfect no logo just plain black

it is like stepping on foam however try not to get them wet or they will soak up the water

Very kind product guys the sandals are really comfortable

The product is made with the best quality and care

They fit prefect

I was spectacle buying sandals online but glad I got these Super comfortable as soon as I put them on Will be looking for an additional pair

These by far have to be most comfortable sandals I have owned

These slides although a little wide were still very comfortable

Love it and I bought 4 pairs to last me years in case these go away one day

The cloud foam makes this one of the most comfortable slides to wear

I would have really liked this product if they were not too small for me I really wish they were a little bigger I would have loved them

By far the best slides I have had to date Like I said I should have bought them sooner

By far the best slides I have bought again should have bought them sooner

These are extremely comfortable I could walk in these all day long

It broke within a week after i got it The strap came off I am disappointed with the quality I got rid of it

Great slides for all around use very comfortable and great quality slide

Bought a pair for inside and a pair for outside Love them

Received a very poor slides Straps are almost separating from the soles Rough edges of the straps

Great slides very comfortable house shoes and I love the all black

Exceeded my expectation Towards this product great quality

The foam is just exceptional It provides my feet with comfort to another level

it is an amazingly comfortable pair of slides but as other reviewers have mentioned it is half a size too big I am a US 8 and wish they would have had a US 7 5

ordered size 11 but they are much bigger than my other size 11 adidas slides

Best slides EVER I ordered 4 for the family The comfort is out of this world for slides it is like boost on slides

I love this product I use them daily If I am not in boost I am on Cloudfoam

The were awesome Would be ordering again They were all perfect and wonderful gifts for Christmas

FEELS LIKE YOUR WALKING ON AIR SO SOFT SPONGE FEEL

Comfortable but too narrow the sole sticks to your foot and absorbs too much liquid Adidas sizing chart is way off

Amazing look and comfort wil buy again and again

The most comfortable slides I have ever worn Color is nice and clean

In the first moment I was not happy because it not fits as I expected Hoewever I start to use every day and was my bad because it is perfect

I have higher arches and these fit so nicely Like I am walking on a cloud

This is a very good looking zlide in person Very impressed and love the comfort of it Keep Adidas Great

It was a little narrow but it was very comfy Would reccomend

as always comfycloudfoam killing the slipper game and looks hella sexy in the mono black

It is comfortable However the disadvantage is that it is very very hard to dry when dipping into the water

Fits great love it my gf keeps stealing it from me

I would go one size up but other than that they are perfect

Best slides I have owned More comfortable than my actual shoes

Extremely comfortable Would recommend I got them for my husband had to get a pair for myself

I wear lots of these types of slip on sandals These are by far the absolute most comfortable ones I have worn to date They are light and the texture is perfect

My husband loves these slides they come in super simple colors and the foam is softer than most of the other slides he has so they are a favorite around our house I Totally recommend I just bought several pair for our extended family Xmas gifts

Very Dope Got them in a steal price Very comfortable and hyoebeast look

Super comfy and for the price could not beat it They do run a little big went full size down from adidas tts and fit is perfect

I really like this product soft touch and good support

Grey seems to be different material then black Grey smoother

I love the cloud foam adilettes Most comfy sandal ever

they are really comfortable it feels like you are walking on clouds love them

i got size 11 and i wear size 11 for shoes but these were too small

Very Comfortable helps a lot with my bad knee Great Quality and very stylish

very comfortable they are good to wear on my feet

This was actually the softest slides I have owned and it fits good

The best slide I have purchased Would highly recommend This is my second pair Comfort is a premium

Returned This version had foam padding on inner side strap Now model changed no padding Looks cheap and not as comfy

I have recommended this sandal to friends most comfortable sandal ever

Title says it all Loved it so much that I bought another pair in a different color

great casual sandal for running around doing errands So comfortable

A little on the tight side but overall great slides

These slides are very comfortable Nothing really special about the design but still an overall great pair of slides

They feel comfy on feet not a bad purchase true to size

it is very comfortable and fits perfectly This is not my first purchase and surely will not be the last

The Adidas Cloudfoam Plus Mono Slides are very flush it feels as if you are literally walking on balls of foam

very comfortable should have bought another pair

Great comfort and lightweight Just do not get them wet or they will have a strange smell Lol

I like this product because the color of the slides looks really good They are also extremely comfortable to wear

The shoes are extremely comfortable and feel like I am stepping on clouds

Love them they are the best pair of slides I have ever owned

they are easy to wear and style also they are comfortable

its Very comfortable and had pretty looks you should try it

Soft and comfortable lovely gift I am happy with my choice

These are the most confortable slides in the market hands down

Very comfortable and better looking in person definitely would buy again

Very comfortable flipflop I can walk in them all day with ease

My foot does not fit in the slides They need to make a wider slide

By far the most comfortable athletic kind of slides I have own

These are very comfortable great width just a bit long i have almost tripped a few times on the front of the slide

These all blacks are where it is at so comfy and perfect

If you generally wear a half size you all probably want to size down So comfy though

I really like this product because I just slide them on and BAM comfort

Yes comfortable although first one started ripping so on my second pair

Comfy I could wear there all day Look nice too

do not buy this Hurts the foot

PERFECT FIT GOOD QUALITY LIGHT COMFORTABLE GOOD

My life changed when I slid into these Great for just wearing around the house

Super comfortable I got them originally for house slippers but I had to get another pair to wear outside

True to size fit well Good arch support Would recommend

These mono slides are minimalist yet classy The only thing that bothers me just a tiny bit is how the top part sort of digs into my feet Nonetheless exelent product

I purchased the grey colorway and loved them they are so comfortable and the straps are suede and looked really nice However the black straps are matte plastic and look really cheap they are super comfy but only getting two stars since I was expecting the same suede and got cheap plastic

These cloud foam slides are unbelievable I have never tried on a slide THIS comfortable before It is like walking on pillows all day Granted these are not ones you would like to get wet for the fear of them smelling stinky but for every day use these are amazing The size fits true to size I could see if you have a fat foot how the width part may be an issue but it is pretty wide unless of course your width is beyond a normal fat foot which in that case you may want to invest in a slide that has a Velcro adjustment

I wish I can enjoy these super soft slippers Unfortunately my wide feet push the sides of it a bit and I can feel my foot hang off the side which makes it not as comfortable

Wish they had smaller sizes left available to purchase but love the sandal

It is so comfortable wish I could wear all day Best slider I have ever worn

The foam tech is amazing Feet sink in and are cushioned Very comfortable after a long day of balling or being on your feet

These have to be the best slides in Adidas lineup I love these need more These are amazing You will not regret getting these

Amazing comfort and quality Feels like I am walking on a cloud

Most comfortable and durable slide ever I wear these inside only and they are nice and cushy

The foam on these slides are super soft and comfy I would recommend them

If you have wide feet maybe order a size up or do not go with these as they are too narrow

Love my new pair of slides very versatile to wear with naything too

Most comfortable slides I have ever worn after a long day of work on my feet there is nothing like slipping these on around the house

Best slides on the market Very comfortable True to size

Really love the cushioning and wearing around for the night Not the greatest to shower with since the slides soak up the water And take a very long time to dry

Extremely comfortable on my feet I wear them everyday They are super light as well

Cheaper materials are now use they do not feel as comfortable as my first pair that I bought last year the upper part of the sandals is now made out of plastic no longer has cushion on the inside will be returning 3 paira that I bought on sale

These slides are very comfy it feels like walking on memory foam I have bought slides from many different brands These are by far the best I have worn This is my second pair I have bought

One of the most comfortable slides but you must downsize a minimum of 0 5 1 full size

Super soft like standing onjelly Difinitely good buy

This is a very comfortable slide with a support for the arch of your foot I am very pleased with my purchase

Extremely comfortable Easily comparable to boost level of comfort Great slides for lounging around the house and stuff

I like this slide and I highly recommend this because it is very soft comfortable and a treat to my feet

These are some of the best most comfortable slides I have ever owned I have a few different colors now

If you go looking for a better and more comfortable slide I guarantee you will not find one

super plush slide sizing for me is right on the monochromatic colors is a win for me

Everything is great just a little too narrow for my feet

Best Slides Ever

I like to wear them for swimming practice or just to chill around

Comfy enough to wear all day at work Highly recommended

Most comfortable slides I have owned Highly recommend I should have purchased 2 pairs

Came damaged A large chunk of the foam was missing on the side But overall it is a good product

Ultralight ultra soft perfect slide for around the house or pool My feet thank me every time I slide them on

Most comfortable slides I purchased like ultraboost comfort

The cloud foam technology is great my feet thanks it

The cloudfoam in this shoe is more squishy My dad has a hard time finding slides that are comfortable and these are the only ones he can wear

I live wearing them home or when I go to the gym But I train with shoes of course

very nice and comfortable good material and cooll

One of the better perchases I have made in life They are much better than wearing flip flops The cloudfoam is super comfortable

It is really comfortable to wear whenever I do not want to wear shoes

I like it cause it makes my fee feel so soft it is a good slippers

Phenomenal comfort that is great for the house or getting off the court

There just Comfortable Overall Good to walk around the house with on

Not comfortable very thin and no cushion got top of foot

I love the black on black look Also the cloud foam was surprisingly comfortable

it is really comfortable and you can wear with almost anything

This is my 3rd pair of the Couldfoam slides I basically get different ones for the design I LOVE these slides Have been using them for over 3 years now and they are still comfortable and really feel like you are walking on a cloud do not wait buy it now

i like it because i did not have good slippers before and now i do

I really appreciate the shape and material of the sandals these do not feel like they will flatten out easily and that they already accounted for that by having the front be thicker I wear a 10 5 usually so I got an 11 there is some slight room in the front and back but it is negligible Otherwise everything else about the sandal is perfect

Best slides I have found the all black color way is a nice change from my previous striped pair

Best slides ever that I have purchased and used with the softest cushion

It fits exact and the comfort is out of this world

I love it so much and I only want to wear this slides The matte black out is so stylish and simple LOVE LOVE LOVE

These slides are the most comfortable slides I have ever purchased

Comfortable Love these and I had to buy another pair

Great to use after work to relax The cloud foam is soft and feels amazing on your feet almost like your feet are getting a massage when you walk

Soft and durable love these sandals worth every penny

Very comfortable and good looking sandals at a reasonable price

Super comfy slides Great house shoes I need a few more pairs

Very comfy will buy again for the entire family Price was great

can not say it enough about how comfortable these slides are

Slide look good Very comfy Size 9 felt like a size 8 returned for a size up which still have not been delivered

The cloud foam slides are much more comfortable than any of the other slides i previously purchased

absolutely love these slides I purchased several sizes

I have been using these around the house and they are pretty comfortable No discomfort after long periods of use

For adidas products I am usually a size 7 5 men and decided to go with size 7 and they fit me perfectly I love the box and the shoes they are just really good looking the comfort is amazing and I would recommend this to anyone looking for slides

Very comfortable Can walk for hours and they are still very comfy

My second pair of adidas slides Just as comfortable

I like it because adidas it is my prefer product so I will keep on to use adidas

I like it a lot But it is a bit larger than my foot I bought size 6 I hope you have size 5 for men on this product

Great slide to be around the house or going out about to be lazy Super comfortable it feels amazing against your feet kind of feels like you are stepping on clouds literally

I love the product because of the style color and the amount of comfortness If possible maybe add a variety of more colors Not just on this product but others as well

Very well built and perfect for getting to and from sports activities

The Cloudfoam slides by Adidas are the best slides on the market right now in my opinion The footbed is contoured which keep your feet planted and the foam itself is a pleasure to walk on I like that they are monotone with no bright logos I only wish these had more padding under the strap They fit true to size for me size 10 US

They run pretty big So get a size smaller The quality is pretty good

The slides were comfortable and they have a nice color

size are not accurate you will end up returning it

Love this slidegood arch and softperfect fo after bball and stylish

love the slides its comfortable and soft like walking in the cloud

Super comfortable would buy and will buy another pair

Better than any slide I have right now The foam just gives it an advance comfort compared to my regular slides do not hesitate Get them

Most comfortable soft cushy slides I have ever owned Went and bought another pair Kinda feels like walking on memory foam super plush

These cloudfoam slides are so dang comfortable I wear them 24 7 while indoors They fit perfect TTS The color looks great as well No adjustment on the top but they for me perfect so that is not an issue you seriously can not go wrong with these slides buy them already will ya

True to size Comfort is there Grey color way Great value

These slides are by far the most comfortable one I have ever own They are excellent

The top is not longer soft and cushy its thin plastic

The most comfortable slides I have owned Bought these to wear around the house and they are very soft and comfy

For the price point I find these the best bang for your buck When I got my pair in I thought they were so comfortable that i told my mother to try them and she loved them I am going to buy her a pair as well

love the all black edition the slides are so comfortable i really hate taking them off

THE size is kind of smaller than 3 0 Overall good quality

Overall I wear these casually and other times outdoors I am a size 10 in Adidas shoes and I got the same size They fit great Not too big not too small do not even get me started on the comfortability it is on another level 10 10 product

If you need something to walk around the house in or to do some errands in the summer these are perfect The soles do not look that durable or grippy so they seem more for casual comfort than something to wear outside a lot The Cloudfoam is soft and squishy They run large so buy 1 2 size down or a full size down if you want it really snug Overall great buy

I wear these slides exclusively indoors and I am tempted to just walk outside them all the time since they are so comfy I chose to purchase these as indoor slippers because the wood floors get really cold and I was getting tired of wearing cheap slippers that do not fit properly Once I got these I can always walk around the house in comfort while avoiding the freezing cold floor Honestly would have bought another for outdoor use if I did not already have slides that I use regularly

Extremely comfortable to wear Fantastic after workout

I am a size 10 5 so size 11 is kinda big other than that these slides are really comfortable and not durable if they made contact with water

This fits a little big to size i would do half a size down if i could Otherwise very comfortable

These are the most comfortable pair of slides I have ever purchased The cushioning is perfect for your feet after a hard workout Oh and they look good 10 10 would recommend

The slide is extremely comfortable The cushioning on the bottom has a lot of give so it is up to preference The band on the top is a bit thin but I do not really see any issues with the slide Overall a really quality product

So comfy and the best adidas sandals I ever have Haha

Really comfortable perfect fitting slides Really soft soles

2 Good traction and excellent build quality

the most comfortable slides I have ever worn and also bought a pair for my wife

I have been on a quest to find the most comfortable slide so I literally bought every pair Adidas made and these are by far the most comfortable I am still questioning why they are that much better when every pair says CLOUDFOAM PLUS maybe Adidas can confirm for me Regarding fit I would size up wear an 11 get 12 The quality of the whole slide is just well constructed and has held up very well so far If planning on buying slides look no further and cop these

most comfortable pair of slides I have ever owned

I wear size 13 and these were way to big Recommend getting 1 size lower

The best sandals that I have ever bought recommend 100

Love them just what I expected Better than the others

very comfortable slide and very soothing after a hard daywork to slide in them and lounge around the house or even out running errands very pleased this buy 

Great fit I ordered one size up fit fine xxxxxxxxxx

Cloud foam is legit Bought these to pad my feet at a standing desk and quality is A

Excellent soft and spongy and stylish Molded to fit your foot I just wish they had half sizes too

Had to steal them back from my wife after she thought they were hers Lol

Comfortable perfect fit excellent price would purchase again

Fits in my feet nicely Feet are comfortable and relax for days

Such a legendary piece that i usually gift to friends and family

Extremely comfortable and definitely hugs your foot like a glove

Had to size down half size from my usual size but this is extremely comfortable and I wear it everyday in the house

Really really comfortable you should buy they rock

Love the product Quality is great and cloudfoam feels amazing

YEEZY looks super comfy Cloadfoam true to size Fire

These slides make me wonder how did I use any other pair before them By far the most comfortable slides I have ever owned

Got the entire family a pair You never find anything else better than these

Wayyyy too big I can not wear these I suggest sizing down a whole size or more

I have been wanting thes slides for a very long time however the two sizes 4 5 for women that I wanted were out of stock My husband ordered them for me when they finally were back in stock in size 5 and I absolutely love them I am so happy with these slides

These slides are extremely comfortable I am so glad i purchased them

Comfortable sandals actually is my second pair my first pair got ruined with bleach

I can not ell if these are cushioned with boost or not but the slides are like walking on clouds

Perfect all black slides Run a little wide and long but are the most comfortable ones out there

I purchased these because they looked to be super comfortable and I wanted to see if what Cloudfoam was all about I was not disappointed They fit true to size and I could not be happier

Since I bought online I would loved the next time in a store to try on a smaller size to see if I could have purchase a size smaller or if my feet just happen to be just in between I come home and my work shoes come off and these are what I wear until I either change in to my indoor pair of Adidas shoes or I change into workout shows

The cloud foam is nice on the feet They could be a bit wider

After my dad told me what he wanted as a birthday gift I completed the order and these sandals are the best thing since sliced bread He takes care of them away from our bulldog and are the first thing he grabs when he has at home Awesome purchase

Slide fit true to size and really comfortable End up buying one for my son as well

It only came in mensizes and I think I got it a little big

Extremely comfortable Fits true to size Seem to hold up very well so far

My first pair of cloudfoam slides lasted me a long time I have owned several pairs of comfort slides from other top brands but nothing compares to the Adidas cloudfoam material This thing has a super comfortable footbed Not sure how Adidas does it but their Boost and Cloudfoam material will keep you hooked forever If I had to nit pick on these slides I noticed only one difference from my older worn out cloadfoam slides and the new ones That is the material under the top i upper used to be padded with a soft foam but the new shoes have an upper that feels like like plastic and or rubber only material Overall it is slightly more uncomfortable especially if you are not wearing the slide without socks on But I would still recommend these slides hands down

These were bought as a gift for my son He called to tell me how soft and comfortable these were I think I will purchase for my grandsons Thanks for the quick shipping

The product is great unless and until you dunk them in water It would give a very foul smell once it get soaked in water

These are the most comfortable slides on the market imo

Most comfortable slide I have ever bought I want every color

Very comfortable sliders but unfortunately they are very narrow and chafe my foot I would size up

Got at half price For what it is full price is way to much Good quality and instructions on how to measure and pick size was a great help

100 comfort guaranteed on the street or at your house

I like the product because of the comfortability They remind me of my ultra post which are A 1 comfort These will be the only slide I will wear

Slides were a little tight above the foot area but after I wore the slides for a couple of days They broke in and now they are super comfortable

Comfort for walking and does not make your feet sweat

Best slides ever

I got these slides on sale and what a great purchase A bit large and could be a bit better material Overall very comfortable and great price Worth what you are paying for

Amazing I wear slides every single day at home and they are by far the best I have ever worn Hands down

Insanly comfortable I really like the single color and simplicty of the design as well

I heard these were good but wow they are so comfy it is like the slides version of ultraboost These are the only sandals I ever want to wear

Great slides all around they fit great feel great and very smooth

Great cushioning but it is very much an effort to keep these on your feet

The cushion on these slides make them comfortable to wear all day

These are the most comfortable slides you will ever purchase Too bad they do not come in half sizes I sized up and they are a bit too big on me Next time I buy the again I will half size down

This is a very comfy slides Worth the money I bought another one because I really like it

best deal I love it very soft and comfortable to wear

have not worn them enough to if a long overview however my initial thoughts are they are comfortable and fit perfect

Great comfort seem to run a larger than other Adidas sandals I have purchased

Too narrow and I have a wide foot so none of the sizes worked I tried 12 13 and 14

Like the product it is comfortable durable simple clean style

High quality slides and very comfy I wear these when I go out all the time

Best ever this is my second pair buy them a size larger they kinda run small I got mine 13 original size is 12 best fit ever

Most comfortable slide ever you will not regret this purchase

My foot

Most comfortable pair of slides I own and for the price you can not beat it

I would recommend because it is comfortable and easy to put on and off

I have wanted these for a while and finally got some They are exactly what I expected very comfortable and they look great

The Comfort on these slides are amazing They were what I expected when I ordered them

These are the most comfortable pair of slides that I own

most comfortable slides ever I personally recommend this product to the public

Like walking on clouds Recommended to my friends They all love it

One of the most comfortable sandals I have ever had or tried on

They run big but very comfy and stylish just go down a size

Really good quality and really comfortable would recommend these big time

most cozy slipper ever bought I uesd to own another pair of the same product over the years it was worn out As long as that happens i bought this one

These are not as comfortable as the ones with padding on the inside Theae have have rubber only no mesh I have both styles but this one is the least comfortable Make sure when purchasing that you make the right choice But other than that these are still better than the other companies slides by far

they are beyond comfortable soft and perfect I can not recommend these enough Make sure you get these They have a few different types of soles for slides these at by far the best

These would be perfect if they had the padding under the foot strap Other Adidas cloudfoam slides I have with the top foot padding are more comfortable The cloudfoam is the only way to go BTW

The comfort is key quickly molds to your feet within a week

Super comfortable and casual looks Also perfect for after a long rigorous exercise

These are nice sandals but I liked the previous one better The foot bed is still great but the strap is now sort of a hard plastic where the old one was a much nicer and softer material It actually was padded and now it is not The benefit is the new ones dry faster but they are definitely not as comfortable Still recommend getting them over other sandals

Super comfortable with lots of cushioning I am usually an Adidas size 10 5 11 and went with the size 10 slides not made in half sizes Hopefully they stretch a bit Otherwise they fit great

Best Adidas slides Super comfy Literally like walking on clouds Will recommend to anyone man or woman

These slides are super comfortable I feel they are a tad large and there are no half sizes which is a little annoying

Highly recommended

Very comfy feeling on your feet they look good too

Very comfortable and the stule is simple that fits me perfect

Purchased for my mom and she loves them Foam is soft but firm enough to support

it is very comfortable and relaxing for my feet Love wearing them all day in the office

Very comfortable I would recommend to anyone looking for a new pair of slides

I liked the comfort of the product but did not like that you could not buy them for wide feet

Easy to slip into when I am in a hurry to get out of the house My friends thought they were really cool too

Got this as a gift my boyfriend He talks about how much he loves them all the time He feels like they are hugging his feet

I was looking for a new pair of sliders The box it came in was nothing special but the sandal itself were comfortable The sole was very soft and I often found myself wearing the slider for hours I highly recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a new pair

I have bad feet I need good arch support and a lot of cushion I was pleasantly amazed at how well these felt on my feet the very first step I felt as if was stepping on clouds floating effortlessly through the clear blue sky I pinched myself ever so slightly to see if I was dreaming but now hard enough to disrupt the magnificent dream

Got these for my girlfriend and she loves them they are stylish the monotone colorway is very high fashion looking She loves how comfortable they are on te insole Her only issue is that they gave her a small blister on her large toe the upper bridge is a bit stuff rough on the top toe area at first might need a bit breaking in

These are so comfortable Cloudfoam is a perfect name for these

Very comfortable slides They conform to your feet

Best Quality Comfort Performance Style Slide Period

really comfortable slides they are soft like walking on cloud

Really comfortable great fit can wear all day long

These shoes are so comfortable and very easy tfor just slide on when I am leaving the house to go run errands

Comfiest slides ever So nice to wear around the house or out

it is so comfy and simple I can literally wear it every time love it

Very nice and comfy had a pair that were gifted to me and had to buy 2 more thats how much i like them

Bought these in a store in Singapore 1st hour wearing it had a blister at the top of my left mid foot 2nd day had 2 blisters and an abrasion on both feet I am a rock climber so I am used to uncomfortable footwear but I expected more of something called Cloudfoam I suppose they might require some kind of break in Could have been avoided if they finished the edges of the plastic mould better

As a size 9 5 I bought a size 10 sandal and it was too small for me So I sized up to a 11 and now it is too big do not bother with these

love this product i wish cloudfoam will be using on another adidas shoes

Super comfy but not going to last long too much for cheapies

It is uncomfortable in the strap area Not fitting well

I do not know why people are saying to size up They must have wide hobbit feet and only care about the width of the slides I wear size 9 in multiple Adidas sneakers Bought these and they are way longer than I expected Good thing I did not listen to people saying to buy an even larger size They are comfortable though and the strap fits snug will probably break in though Going to sadly return these and size down

Great shoes for slipping on and going Very comfy and soft Ultra absorbent with no slippage when wet Big plus here

The design and color combination is nice I am curious as time continues how they will keep up

Ultra comfy can use it all day every day I would by as many colors as there were availablewaiting for extra colors

The padding Is not the same the cushion is no longer the same

boost and I bet some would debate that Great for around the house Cloudfoam is no joke Great price point too

I wanted a pair of slides primarily for around the house use These fit the criteria purfectly

Best purchase of slides they are extremely comfortable Very squishy

Because there so comfortable to walk in for a long hours

Cloudfoam is the perfect material for slippers is hard to find comfortable ones

I love these slippers I am normally a size 7 1 2 in women and a 6 in men fit me perfectly I also have wide feet so the slippers were very accommodating

I have the same slides in Red Love them so I got the gray ones I got the same size and these are a tad bigger Which I did not think it would be a big issue but after a week they looked all busted up After a week of light wear the tips are all messed up Really comfortable but they are just really fragile I guess do not wear them on concrete that is for sure

Seriously the most comfortable sandals ever created It runs slightly large could go half size down

These are good slides and pretty comfortable but adidas used to make a style with a softer foam footbed and a suede like material on the part that goes over your foot Those were the best slides I ever had but they were not very durable I bought a pair every 6 8 months but it was well worth it for the comfort This style lacks the extreme comfort but they are still good and I think they will last longer than the super soft style that you can not get anymore Given the option I would rather have the softer style but will wear these for now Please bring back the super soft slides

These are the best slides ever if you want to do something nice for ur feet then get thesefacts

Most comfortable slides I have ever worn Though it got wet due too heavy rain any ideas how to dry it since it is absorbing so much water

Very comfortable even with socks on My new go to slides

These slides are incredibly comfortable Your feet sink into them in the most wonderful way They definitely run a bit large I would suggest going a 1 2 or full size down

Disappointed in you adidas

Super comfy It only takes a day or two for your feet to get used to them

i wear these slides everyday and let me tell you that I love them so much I own 2 different colors though i will never buy another brand slide period

I love these slides They are super soft and comfortable

Comfort wise nothing beat these just a little to narrow but I went up one full size and they are perfect

Love the slides hands down best slides world wide Nothing else comes close to comfort adidas is definitely 2nd to none

Nice and comfy can not beat the looks Good stuff Adidas good stuff

Love these soft cute comfortable perfect I highly recommend

I love them they are my first slides ever and they are so comfortable I am just scared they might rip on the strap but whatever love themlt 3

I was double charged as were many other people This is what caused me to give a low rating

it is like walking on clouds most comfy slides you will ever wear On my fourth pair

thought they would be like the older model these are not comfortable at all

I liked the comfortable sole of the sandals I would have liked the top inside part to be a little softer Other than that it is a great sandal and on trend

I already had a pair of the sandals in white and blue and I love them so I decided to get another pair The only thing I did not like about these new ones is that there is no cushion under the strap My white and blue ones do have them Maybe I chose a diff one But overall they are great My brother and dad also got a pair for father day

I was debating between the monotone pair and the stripes These definitely look classier in person and they feel so awesome underfoot even plushier than ultraboosts imo

Love the comfy fit and came well recommended by a family member

I have severe nerve damage in my feet and I need something comfortable without being overly soft To soft hurts my feet after a little bit of walking The footbed is dense enough and comfortable that I can walk a long distance Now make me some Gazelles with this comfort please

Hands down the most comfortable slides I have ever owned They conform to your foot have a high arch and they are not too snug like a lot of slides when you first buy them Great slides

Slides for everything Swimming chilling walking chores Name it its comfy and versatile

It is the Rolls Royce of slippers folks Buy someone you love a pair

The strap is a bit loose But otherwise really comfortable sole

Idk why if it is the color and material but these black model clouds compared to the gray models which I have as well and are super soft compared to these black colorway that is pretty stiff and not as Marshmallow feeling kinda disappointed like a lot because I was expecting the same softness

If you have wide feet stay the heck away lol Regardless if you order up a size still does nothing in width and will continue to be narrow

Why do not more slides have cloud foamBest pair of slides I have EVER owned do not bother any other pair of slides honestly

Very very comfortable slides wore them after a practice the other day and they definitely helped my feet feel great

Feels great what can I say but that

I am not a fan the rubber strap is way to long it starts near the toes and cones up towards the mid part of the foot The strap is also a rubber material that does not allow the foot to breathe I suggest you go up at least one size as the slide is kind of narrow

If ur inbetween sizes try to see if you can try in store Im a 10 5 and got a 11 and there is a little too much room for my taste in the back

very cnmfortable and true size with more colors to choose will be better

Awesome sandals just bought a size to small Would buy again

Just what the title says can not go wrong amazing comfort

I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them Although they are sooo comfy I have honestly probably worn them more times than he has

Fit is perfect and so comfortable Whether heading from the gym or just lounging around these will for the bill

They look good and feel great unlike most slides ive been wearing these all summer lol my tan line is bad on my feet cuz of these tho

It is good because it is very comfortable but it is not good because the width is terrible for a flat foot I recommend to get a size bigger for a flat foot

These bad boys are like walking on air So comfy that I ordered myself another pair

If you have wide fit Even a little bit wide Size up They are way to right and have no give

Very comfortable Slides feels like you are walking on air If you are a half size I would recommend that you get the size up

I like everything about the slide It is extremely comfortable and I did end up taking the advice of others and order a size up from my normal shoe size The size worked out really great

They are extra light and super comfortable to wear

these slides are super soft and comfortable but for whatever reason they are a size too large for me

I have had every brand and type of sandal but cloudfoam is superior comfort The quality is great also

Like I said above I like the colors and it is a nice fit

love this product runs a little bigger than other adilette slides

So basic comfortable and clean looking They go with everything

Soft but the contours in the footbed cause fatigue

Definitely cause the Adidas quality so comfy and fashionable

Love these slides so cozy I wear them barefoot for extra comfort great summer shoe

Bad uncomfortable should not have gotten rid of the foam at the top of the slide

I own many slides sandal and this is by far the most comfortable one the strap is perfect size most other brand are to lose I can wear this all day solid color is perfect please make other solid color navy charcoal burgundy or red do not change a thing I will buy some more

I did not do much research on this slipper before purchasing I bought it on looks alone and boy was I surprised when I wore them for the first time This is the second time Adidas wow would me first was putting on a pair of ultraboost for the first time Definitely recommend this slipper and am currently trying to find a way to wear them to work I usually wear a size 10 but purchased them in a size 9 I have narrow feet though

These slides are an absolutely essential purchase for everyone do not be mislead if you have tried cloudfoam sneakers in the past but were left underwhelmed The comfort of these slides are unmatched even by the mighty Ultraboost I have worn these almost nonstop for 2 weeks now and the cushion has shown no signs of bottoming out even after hours of use

These sandals are the most comfortable sandals ever For the price do yourself a favor and buy these

I am very happy with these and am going to order more colors

I am a size 9 but I randomly decided to order a pair of size 8 Because a pair of size 9 were out of stock I guess it was a blessing in disguise because size 8 was a fit for me in this particular pair It may only be me but consider buying one size down in this pair of slides 5 stars nonetheless

Super comfortable nice sleek look Adidas is ahead of the game with this slide

Comfort level is amazing I need another pair ASAP

Super comfy no blisters I have worn them almost every day since I got them and I love them so much

I previously bought other name brands and the quality for the price was not good This adidas slide are amazing super comfortable and the color is perfect 

So comfortable I wear them everywhere No foot pain

I have the black and white cold foams adillette now those are COMFY thought this color would be too it is not Plus the size is too big And I am stuck with them Now

Awesome so comfy and simple Thanks for making product and please do not discountinue

Beats any Nike slides in comfort trust me Comfortable and sleek

Soft slides for the summer they are a little wide so it is a slightly loose fit but I do not weigh that much so that plays a big part in it

Nice design great price like walking in a cloud

Love the comfort and style Very subtle it is perfect for walking around the house and small errands

Great buy very comfortable size is based off of UK sizing

Love the slides Very comfortable love the design of it

I have flat feet and these slip on are amazing I might buy another pair

These slides are so comfortable They feel like you are walking in a cloud There the ONLY comfortable slides out there

Stylish and so so comfortable highly recommended to one an all

My daughter urged me to buy these and I am so glad I did These are the most comfortable slip on casuals I have for summer Feels like I am walking on pillows

Very comfortable slides I would def recommend them to anyone looking for some comfortable stylish pair of slides they will have you walking around the house for no reason lol

I like the contours of it and was looking for a pair I could still wear with socks

I love them after wearing a few weeks Great out of the shower or after a long work day

I own 6 of these series sandals I bought 3 pais in Las Vegas in November and bought some other designs online last month Too bad when the ones i ordered online came it has less cloudfoam on the top Actually the new models does not have any cushion on the arch top of my foot the first versions were perfect Please bring it back or tell me how i can get a couple more pairs of the first version thank you

I love these slides so comfortable have in two colors now will continue to purchase

The reviews were confusing because some people say to size up and some say to size down I personally sized down I usually wear a size 10 in adidas but I had I get a size 9 so they would feel secure when walking I would recommend trying them on in person However I tend to run a bit on the small size of a size 10 Great slide

These feel great on feet They go with all sorts of outfits and feel amazing

Super comfortable completely different than anything else out there Treat your feet to these

highly recommend this product Fit perfectly you can wear to the pool or with a nice pair of shorts

These are worth every penny They really do feel like you are walking on clouds

I have bad feet and hard time finding comfortable sandals These feel great

My favorite and most comfortable slides Love them

Adidas certainly knows what they are doing in the sense of comfort From their Boost material in sneakers I also own a pair of EQT Support 93 17to this Cloudfoam technology not much rivals them Combine that with a sleek timeless black on black design and you have an instant classic My absolute go to in the spring summer months here in Texas which as you can imagine is 75 of the year Highly highly recommend

Super comfortablenot too expensive for a great pair of slides

I think Adidas did it again For a long time I had under Armour 4d foam slides and thought they were the best But these are way better imo not only in comfort but also In design

I already know the product it is very confortave and it fits in my foot By the way is nice model

Very soft and comfortable that is all I wanted to say it is making me type more

Super comfy and they look amazing My wife wants a pair Ow

I like them but do not love them since my wife pair of slide are much more comfortable

I own several pairs of adidas slides These seem large and wide and front part of top is too small and causing blisters after one wearing I would return them if I had not worn them Still like almost all of your shoes slides and apparel

Overall I do like them They look fantastic but too narrow

Very comfortable I would recommend this particular shoe to anyone I love them

I literally forget I am wearing these sandals due to how comfy they are When I first got them the upper rubbed against my foot somewhat uncomfortably but that solved itself after a few days of wearing them My only complaint after wearing these for several months is that the cushion retains water so if you wear them in the rain or otherwise get them wet you are going to be sloshing around a little bit until they dry out

Had to return got the wrong size we are to big Going to order again

If you are looking for soft comfortable slides look no further These slides are truly like walking on clouds I hurt the ball of one foot about a month ago these slides help to ease pain I still feel Highly recommend

Strap on slide is too wide not specified in fitting chart The slide will fall off your foot

They do not hold if you wear them wet at the pool etc

So comfortable you forget that they are on your feet Love the mono black colorway

Great slides Would order a half size down if i were you I do miss my old pair of adissage but these are awesome too

The best dang thing you will ever buy hands down the most comfortable slides ever made bruh

The inner lining has started to come apart in just 2 weeks

Comfortable amazing product and quality I would recommend this product to anyone and price for a high quality item it is two thumbs up five stars all the way thru

I was looking for a simple yet elegant design and these fit the bill I do not care to be a walking logo These say Adidas in a subtle way

The only bad thing about the shoe is the color seems to be faded or fades rather quickly Black should be darker

My favorite slides Perfect fit and comfort I would like more colors of this exact style Overall I am extremely happy with this purchase

Very comfortable the best out there The competition does not compare

Very comfortable fit kind of like walking on a anti fatigue mat

Love these there the most comfortable slides ive ever owned like walking on air

The most comfortable sandal at an affordable price Would definitely rebuy or gift it to someone because you cannot go wrong with this style and comfiness

Fits perfectly Super comfortable All grey looks awesome

I have owned many slides and none have felt as pillow like at these cloudfoam slides must wear with socks if going far distance as left slide is a bit wide for my foot but ill keep them for short strides around the house

I thought these were going to be the hard plastic like the others They were not

This are awesome super soft Literally they do feel like clouds

These are my most comfortable slides There so comfortable I will provably buy another pair

These are super comfortable but i had to go a size down from my normal sneaker size

I purchased this as a Valentine gift great buy for the hubbie

Comfortable good looking High quality Would purchase again for the price

Fits true to size Very comfy and soft Would recommend

These are ridiculously comfortable Bought a second pair just now

When I got them they were a little ripped but they are comfortable

They are amazing You cannot compare with the comfort this is ultraboostcousin cloudfoam

The comfort is beyond what i imagine will most definitely be trying to get another pair

house shoescheck after work out commutecheck taking out the garbagecheck

Great quality and comfort I would definitely buy a second pair

I definitely recimmend purchasing if you are looking for comfortable slides Also love the minimal look

Love these shoes a tiny bit to big because I am a half size but nothing anyone else notices and they wear fine and are very comfortable I ended up liking them so much I bought two pairs

Comfortable cushion on slip on stylish silhouette have not broken them in yet but can only imagine they will get more comfortable

Great product Super comfortable and the lack of logos and embellishment make them a nice quality alternative to other slides available on the market

COMFY Runs large I went down a size and a half from my normal shoe size for the best fit

These slides are so comfortable and fit perfectly

The unlocked cloud foam on these slides makes the difference as far as step in comfort is concerned

Very comfortable but very tight at top of foot going tts Seems to break in a little after a few wears if you have narrow feet it should not be a problem normal or wide footers may want to go up a size

At first I was skeptical about the slides because I had not seen them in person so I did not think they would be comfortable But when I received my package and tried them on they were amazing The slides are super comfortable very light weight and durable I really like them they were a great purchase and I would love to buy another pair again

So comfortable Neutral colors and it will go with everything

These slides are sooo comfortable I bought them for my husband as a valentines gift and now I want to purchase the women for myself Feels like you are walking on a cloud I should have got him a 12 instead of a 11 but he said they fit just right for him

This slide is very comfortable but I purchased them as a post workout side for the showers at the gym The problam is the soul holds the water almost like sponge I would only recommend wearing this slide in dry conditions

I have been saving for this slides I was planning to wear it at the beach when I fly to Philippines The quality is really good feels so comfortable It does not look cheap I recently ordered size 6 but it is too big I should have ordered size 5 It says on reviews that it fits perfectly but apparently not The hassle of returning it it is too much I will just give it to someone who needs slippers back home I am very disappointed but I will just share it to someone so my money do not go to waste

Yeah like all I can say is that the Adidas slides are the bomb com they feel like pillows they are asking us at the bottom line

I love these slides I wore them to c and not thinking they would hold up but they came out looking new They are the most comfortable thing I have ever worn I would definitely wear these over any boost

love the feel under the feet It is my first pair of adidas slippers and I definitely recommend them

A girlfriend of mine put me on to these bought some fell in love and got some for my nephew because he liked mine so much I am not the type of person to have multiples of shoes but I would DEFINITELY buy another pair of these

Very clean lines and extremely comfortable Actually this is the most comfortable slide I have ever owned

Like walking on clouds Forvever adidas Never but other shoes again

I love these slides so much i had to get another pair for myself and another one for the gf I highly recommend this to anyone in the market for some slides Full sizes only so if you want a perfect exact fit order half a size down if you want some wiggle room then order half a size up my true size is a 9 5 superstar and i wear a size 10 in Ultraboost and nMDand i got these slides in a size 9 and they fit my narrow feet perfectly Hope this helps Ciao

the sandals are perfect they are comfortable would recommend

Best purchase of slides sandals I have ever made Would definitely buy more they are extremely comfortable

Was recommended by a friend now I wan every color Looks nice but feels great in your feet Cloud foam very comfy I may try the shoes next

Lots of comfort and great look Good for all day wear

Size is too large must go one size lower than usual

I would recommend that adidas be more honest about the sizing of their products A couple of products run smaller than average

very comfortable and would recommend to any one looking for a pair of slides and i did

They have a ton of cushion They run about a 1 2 size big If your looking for a new pair of slides these are the ones

it is crazy comfortable The cloud foam bends with your foot compared to other slides that have a hard bottom to them

I thought i ordered a different pair my Son suggested for me but i absolutely Love the accidental pair i purchased EXTREMELY comfortable and would recommend to others

Only thing I did not like was that the top part of the Sandles did not have cushion on them

I really enjoy the comfort of these slides I have owned slides of all brands and nothing has came close to these of Adidas Unfortunately the bridge of the slides could be improved as it looks like they will not be lasting very long before they deattach but the comfort heavily outweighs this

Comfortable and slick You can not beat the prices for these slides

It conforms with my foot perfectly Very soft and would recommend to anyone needing a slide

All of the reviews are right these slides are incredibly comfortable I normally wear a size 8 in womenso I ordered a size 7 menbased on the size chart However I think I could have gone with a men6 but I will be keeping my pair as I am still happy with the fit Thank you Adidas for the shoes and free speedy delivery

I was curious about what all of my friends was talking about because they all bought Adidas adilette cloudfoam slides so i decided to give them a try And not only that I ended up purchasing 3 pair Moving to Orlando in a couple of months so these will be my new go to slides for sure

So soft and it is the right fit just amazing every one should get some

This is a very comfortable and quality product I would highly recommend it

These are easily the most comfortable slides on the market buy with confidence

Most comfortable slides ever Would recommend buying these

Fits great and looks great very comfortable I gave these as gifts

Loved the product but the Slides arrived with the box curled up its taken several attempts to straighten Nice upgrade from the old school soccer slides that have lasted many years I hope these do the same

Most comfortable slipper I have ever worn Highly recommended

Your foot just sinks into them so nicely makes me want to walk around my house for no reason

If hey had more sizes available I would have ordered for my son and nephews

Great purchase because of its quality and price I would purchase again

Most comfortable pair of slides I have ever put on my feet Highly recommend

Most comfortable slides I have ever owned Would purchase again

Much more comfortable than it looks The top feels a little flimsy but is light so it is ok

Most comfortable slides ever This color scheme blk blk blk mono has a great look and feel great I wear them nonstop

The most comfortable pair of slide I have ever owned

I really enjoy the color way and the comfort or the sandals

Feels like your wearing clouds Must have for anyone looking for sandals

These slides are extremely comfortable I would recommend these to anybody

Cozy as heck and they look clean I would recommend

Most comfortable slides I own they are like walking on air

Like walking on clouds Soft but with arch and footbed support

I bought this item for my boyfriend and he loved it he said they were super comfy

Best of the best slide Once you wear it you would not want to take it off its the best slide I have own and im planning to get more

These are the most comfortable slides I have ever had They provide so much cushion and comfort while being super lightweight

I do not like the product it is look nice on the photo But i received disappointed the way it is look like

These slides are perfect Style comfort fit Everything on point Not much more to say

The most comfortable slides I have ever owned Very responsive cushioningI get a boost of energy when I put these slides on after work

Really Comfy foam Perfect for indoor shoes but gets dirty easily

They have an extremely comfortable sole They really look good as well

I would definitely recommend these to anyone Most comfortable slides I have

They are great sandles really comfortable You will not regret buying

Adidas hands down all about comfort and quality Never degrade from that standard Adidas

Needed Another Pair of Slides So I gave it a try

the most comfortable slides i have ever worn PERIOD

In love with these slides So soft like walking on clouds

Solid slide to put on after a workout or when you come home from work and slide right in too

Too narrow for my feet too small compared to Adidas tennis shoes I have bought

I have wide feet so the lack of adjustable straps excluded me from these otherwise extremely comfortable slides Shame

These are amazing slides and cloudfoam is incredible on your feet The cushion is amazing and great to wear around the house or after some sports activity I got the grey colorway and loved the minimal branding on it looks very sleek There is a note on the tag that says not for shower use I assume the cloudfoam just soaks up water so I plan not wearing to the beach pool shower I bought this while on sale during cyber Monday and read the numerous reviews If you are iffy and are reading reviews like I was take my word and just buy them You will be sold once on your feet

Best slides ever Best slides ever Best slides ever

Affordable and comfortable had to go 1 size down though

Super comfortable and great price Would buy again

Awesome Slide Just wish the bottom sole was the harder traditional bottom from the OG Adilette slides

Love the sponge like feel with every step i take

Product is really comfortable and they look really good as far as visual appearance

Perfect fitment cushion is very soft Love the all black look too

Super soft and cushy Highly recommend these I might could have gone a size down

Because of coooooooooooooooooooooooommmmfffoorrrtttttt

Very comfortable like walking on great foam cushions Great purchase

Durable comfy safe on wet floors I am purchasing the same model since 20 years tried many others bRand but I happy with this one

I bought these boots for work due to standing on my feet all day and walking I order the size I always gets but these boots run small and I have worn them so I cant return I would have love to order a bigger size but they are all sold out

Letters carrier for 33 years best feeling shoe I ever used Thanks so much

Ive been wearing Manoas for about 5 years now I buy 2 pairs a year because Im afraid they will one day discontinue these boots nothing lasts forever I wear these boots all year around for work and off days unless its really hot out they are very comfortable light weight water proof and still look good after a year of use If wearing them in cold winters I recommend wearing thick wool socks because they are are not thermal insulated Had to order half size larger

I actually use these for work they are great I would recommend them to anyone

Purchased these for work as a local truck driver Fit was GREAT VERY COMFORTABLE Can wear these boots ALL DAY without feet getting sore or fatigued Would purchase these boots again and again for as long as they are available Of COURSE Finish Line was very instrumental in the purchase process as wellDelivering the boots to me VERY QUICKLY and without any issues ALWAYS GREAT dealing with Finish Line they NEVER DISAPPOINT

Got a pair on sale because I liked the color I can confirm that it is very light and comfortable It feels more like tennis shoes than boots Very happy with my purchase

These nike boots are so good for anything I deliver mail on my feet for more than ten hours a day and NEVER had complaints about my feet hurting

My wife absolutely loves them and says I look hot in them They feel real comfortable and look great with jeans rolled up

I needed something TRULY waterproof for work that would be comfortable for a ton of walking and these fit the bill They are definitely more of a snow boot than a work boot but not conspicuously so I do find my feet getting pretty toasty in them but I think that would be the case with anything truly waterproof These are much more comfortable to walk in than any snow or work boot I have ever worn but they will not replace my casual shoes Overall I am very pleased

I needed a new boot and these were on sale similar look to tims better comfort though Great grip for snow Ice fully functional and very comfortable Must buy especially for the low price

These are my all day everyday shoes all year long I buy 2 pair each year I walk in them for exersize I have had back problems Manoa says NO lol Love them

These Joints right here are now my everyday boot of choice I can rock them with anything and they are all day comfortable

Very comfortable and stylish Fits true to size I recommend these to anyone looking for style as well as comfort Actually pretty warm too

My husband loved the boots They fit true to size The boots arrived on time for christmas

They fit great Came faster then expected Great price

great snow winter boot My only issue is the laces come loose because they are not long enough Overall they are comfortable

Got my wife and I a pair for Christmas Good in the snow and warm on your feet

This is my second pair of these boots I have the Haystack color ones already I had to have the Black ones to match different outfits This Nike boot is very comfortable extremely light weight for a boot I bought them for casual wear not work Love them

In the last few months I have purchased these boots for both my boys and my husband as a stylish go between boot They each needed boots for the rain and snow but something that they do not have to change into and this boot is perfect it is waterproof comfortable and looks good with anything

Bought these for my boyfriend he absolutely adores them

Luv this purchase true to size very comfortable light weight Love the feel and the haystack color could not have made a better choice for a pair of Nike boots I recommend these for anyone that needs a pair of great looking comfortable boots

Great shoe with a great fit I was very pleased with my purchase

Great deal I have gotten so many compliments very comfortable also

Nice comfortable boots Also adequate price Fast shipping

They feel really good Love them Finish line always got deals

I have always wanted a wheat color pair of boots the Timberland version never goes on sale so I went with Nike these boots are very comfortable I receive compliments about them all the time

I loved the style and the low price was even better I liked the convenience and fast delivery

10 000 steps a day Try it you will like it great boots for value

I have the Black and Tan pair I wear the black pair to work and have worn them in the rain and they keep me dry These are my favorite boots by far

Comfort of a sneaker Looks like a boot Lots of compliments and people asking where did you get those shoes

I bought a pair of these 2 years ago and they are still sound just scuffed up but wear well I bought another pair last month for casual dress I will use the old ones for rainy days and jeans They fit well and last

I read the reviews and watched a few videos and they had great reviews and said nothing but good things about these boots I myself find the boots to be very comfortable and I got the boots on a huge discount I am very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommended purchasing these boots

These Nike ACG are off the book Very comfortable they fit great and the price was amazing Definitely suggest purchasing these if you are looking good quality price right and dope boots

These shoes ran a tab smaller than expected Luckily I was told they would But overall I love the style and comfort

Got it just in time for the rainy weather in SoCal These boots are comfy and lightweight They seem durable and the style is great Also it was the deal that made me buy them and it didnt disappoint great shoes overall

I bought these because they were on sale and my old Nike Air Max which I wore to work had holes in them after about 2 years I picked up boots this time around because after all these would be my work shoesTotally worth it Spend 8 hours a day in them walking around inside and outside Excellent tread comfort and stays true to how Nikeusually fit Very comfortable for boots and not nearly as heavy as I expected All around great buy and highly recommended

One of the most comfortable boots I have ever owned Now offer them insulated in a mossy oak camo pattern and they would make excellent hunting boots

I wear it all day The color is not what i expected but it was just fine I will order another pair

Solid boots for casual outdoor activity comfortable maybe not as warm as I would have liked but they are perfect for casual wear look good as well

I wore these twice and had to exchange them It took 5 minutes to get them on each time There was no give even with laces loosened as much as possible or even unlaced partially They are comfortable once you get them on but it is too much of a battle to get to that point

I wanted a pair like this and when I saw the sale price I knew I had to act fast I was going to purchase a pair of Timberlandand decided to buy these instead and I am totally pleased with the purchase

I wanted a good looking boot to wear to outdoor sporting events in inclement weather Very pleased with this purchase

The picture online shows these boots with acg on the tongue The actual boots do not say acg because they are not acgIts a clear misrepresentation of the boot Now i will say they are very comfortable and durable I wear them for work Possibly the most comfortable boots I have owned

I simply bought this boot for weather purposes and the fact it was very fairly priced It may not be as good in terms of comfort or material than other sneaker boots but again for the price Steal They look good on feet too I got some compliments with these

Very comfortable Great pair of boots for the price

I purchased a pair for work and a week later I purchase a pair for casual wear

the only problem is the right shoe hurts my feet Fells like smaller after couple of hours it is killing me

I bought these for my husband and it is not the type of shoe he would normally wear but he really loves them and I feel like a hero now

Purchased for about 55 They look sharp and are doing a fine job repelling water so far

My husband loved these boots He said they are surprisingly warm and extremely comfortable The look pretty sleek too Awesome deal 

These nike boots are great and feel great could wear these all day

Except I received a slightly damaged pair Right boot was a bit bigger Felt loose I took a hard look and measured Yes I was right It was bigger Awesome Customer service allowed me to return for an exchange They received the boots now I am waiting for replacement Thanks

They are super light but that is where the goodness ends Trying to break them in but insoles are to flat Wanted to put my own insoles in but the ones in them are glued down A bit disappointed but I have to deal with them

Super comfy you could walk on pavement all day on these Lightweight very nice boots I can not say enough good things about them

I want to start by saying that these are extremely comfortable light and are a great winter shoe When they arrived the box was completely crushed and when I took the boots out of the box there are two dark smudges on the swoosh that makes it look like someone wore them before me Not real happy with this purchase

These are constructed well Comfortable and stylish enough to wear for work or play Bought as a gift for my hubby He loves them

True to size and good price for the value Nike makes some nice inexpensive boots for all kind of uses

To me they look better online I am sure they look good from the side but when I look down they look like some cheap security guard boot I can say they were comfortable I returned mine and got the Nike Goadome boots They have the quality leather look that I was looking for

My husband saw the tan Nike boot on a rapper named Drake and he just had to have them he actually thought they were special made and we will not find them but to my surprise went online to finish line and there they were thank you so much he can not start wearing them

Stylish comfortable and light

I would give 5 stars if the boots matched the picture Mine says acg on the sides and bottom but not on the tounge that would have been nice I emailed nike and they assured me they are real nike ACG Leather def looks real it is nice and soft and the boots are pretty darn comfy I just wish they kept the acg on the tounge cus it seems to bother some people including me Fit true 2 size and I am a 14

Bought the haystack color for my husband because he had seen them in the mall and then later decided that he really wanted them He says they are VERY comfortable They also look really nice And this price was the best deal vs timberlands Drake also wore these on one of his music videos 

Bought a pair for my 17 yr old and my husband went with the grey color for my husband though they both love them the look and the fit We saved a lot of money on this purchase great deal My son originally asked for more Timberland boots I purchased these instead he was not disappointed at all

Great buy for a nice stylish pair boots good fitting and comfortable not insulated so a bit on the chilli side during cold days so far they have been waterproof and keep my feet dry

I bought the boots for a Christmas gift after he wanted a more expensive pair of boots I thought he would like these better especially once I seen the price compared to others and he DID

This is the second pair son loved the first and he out grew them so purchased a second pair

Very comfortable affordable and I can wear with anything

These boots were on sale so I made the purchase Not sure if these shoes are true Nike ACG The pictures show the ACG symbols on the bottom and on the side but the actual boot that i received doesnt have them Still a comfy boot for the price I paid Just do not expect true Nike ACG 

Very nice boots and very comfortable The price was great and I definitely got the bang for my buck

Work shoes for my husband He loves them wants to get the exact ones when these ones wear out

Bought this shoe for grandson for Christmas but was disappointed that it was not the shoe that was pictured in the ad Shoe advertised as ACG but this is not what I received Returned to store for larger size and was told that it is the same shoe but I do feel this is false advertisement Other than that looks good wears well

Use these for work I am drive and deliver for UPS these are PERFECT for the job I would recommend these to anyone

I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas He absolutely loves them Very comfortable and true to size Very happy with the great deal and outcome of this product

My son bought a pair and liked them so I ordered him a different color for Christmas He was very happy

Excellent product at a great price I would definitely purchase again

These were ordered for wet and cold weather and they do not fail Love the fit of them The sizing is 1 2 size up for comfort Would definitely recommend

The price was amazing and the color isnt at ever shoe store

I got as a gift for Christmas to myself I wore all day out in snow wet not 1 time were my feet wet I had a similar pair of Nike high top that last a long time I have a feeling these will as well very comfortable for Nike seems to run half size big but a boot you want a thicker sock anyway so that is OK thus far I am impressed the company asks you how is it going with purchase came quick in mail id highly recommend

Here in Michigan we get a lot of snow during the winter I saw these boots and they looked very stylish almost better than Timberlands Getting through the snow without a problem while the boot looks very nice I love them that is why I decided to purchase anot her pair

My son was in need of a boot for this winter and had requested a pair of Timberlands I saw the Nike Manoa on sale and could not resist I got them in Brown My son wore them to school the day after they were delivered and he told me that the boots were very comfortable and his feet felt good and cushioned in them I am a happy mother I love Nike shoes

Perfect boot for work and casual wear Definitely would purchase again

I have always liked Nike boots I have found these to be very comfortable and lightweight A boot with a tennis shoe feel Love it

I bought these to wear in the winter time while I cover athletic events for my high school They are comfortable and fashionable I am happy

Husband finds these boots very comfortable to work in and to add they are very fashionable He had a black pair that he just wore out so now that it is close to Christmas I bought him all four different colors

Nike keeps getting away with using cheaper and cheaper materials bc we let them we the consumer need to speak up and demand the old nike quality leather suede ect These boots are called manoa black leather and they are cheap synthetic pleather finishline did great 5stars good price fast delivery

I have wanted these for over a year now They were reduced a bit but more importantly they had my size I bought them to wear on a trip to KU I lived in them once I got there and they were absolutely awesome

I wear orthotics and these were perfect both in fit and comfort I got several compliments the first time I wore them

The pair that fitslove them Have the other pair and have sent emails asking how I can switch out to get the right size and no response Really want to get them switched out so I can wear the other color Great price look great super comfortable and 1 thing that I really love they are not bulky super heavy very light It does not feel like you have a boot style of shoe on just feels like a pair of gym shoes Hopefully they will tell me soon how I can switch out the other pair

My husband is a landscaper and he is out from sun up to sun down Theses boots have proven to be very comfortable for him They also keep his feet dry when he is pressure washing

I am in construction and they provide a firm stance with great support Much better than work boots since I walk all day long I get home and my wife says why I do not take them off They are too comfortable

I bought these after searching for a while to get some replacement boots for my Teva Riva that I would had for a few years THe description stated they were leather but when they arrived quickly they seem to be vinyl at best Really cheap looking and not what I expected I called and they agreed I could send them back so I did Maybe buying over the web is not such a good idea

They are my work boots Very light Plenty of support on my arch Waterproof Well done Nike

I Bought this as a gift for my bf his job requires a lot of Standing and walking and he loves them he claims they are super comfy and stylish

This is my second pair they are the most comfortable work shoes Ive ever had The black are alot better around wet areas than the haystack

I am in Law Enforcement and wear these boots in all types of conditions and doing plenty of walking running so I needed comfort If anything gets on them I can easily be wiped off I purchase shoes boots for look and comfort and these reach both needs

I have had these before and loved them now there worn out and order a new pair and some thing is wrong with them because the right is hurting the top of my big toe really bad on top part of foot above ball of foot

The picture showed it had laces part way up and then the little things that you lace the rest of the way and when they showed up it was laces ALL the way to the topI do not like that part but they are the lightest boots anyone has ever seen and are comfortable after you get them on One huge thing though these are NOT OIL RESISTANT If you walk in anything greasy or oily it sticks like glue and tracks everywhere you walk Never seen anything like that beforeComfortable though

I bought these boots in the Haystack color for my 18 year old son for Christmas He absolutely loves them We live in Michigan so he wears boots every day during the winter months He said they are very comfortable he wears them all day long I bought him a size 10 which is his normal size and they fit true He did use a spray water proofer on these also sold by Finish Line and they did darken the color of the boot He said he gets a lot of compliments on these boots

The size comfort and look are all perfect to be worn all day

very good

Nice look great quality good deal Definitely will buy again

These shoes are very durable and comfortable great nice shoes

Bought these for my 15 year old son He loves them and has been wearing them every day

Bought these for my husband who walks around all day delivering packages Also walks 3 miles home everyday and he said super comfortable can wear in any weather and true to size

Moving away from Timbs as i get older decided to try these based upon the reviews of comfort i put then on soon as i got them and have been impressed since will now be go to with jeans and even some sweatpants but now the weather is warming so can not wait to next year or even rain as waterproofing should be no issue love these boots

I got the nubuck for my husband for Christmas and he liked it very much that I decided to get another one for him in a different color He said it is very comfortable and lightweight unlike the other boots that he wore In fact I got my 10yr old son a pair too Love that it has kids sizes

Bought these for work and after reading all the reviews I was convinced they would be comfortable Well I was right love these boots I do a lot of walking at my job and these boots are very comfortable Will buy another pair and I would recommend these boots to a friend

Bought for my son he loved them he had originally wanted Timberlands considering he does not wear boots much I chose ones for both he got a boot shoeteammomwin

I originally bought the Air Max Goadome boot and after they tore up my ankles I exchanged them for the Manoas The Manoa boots are very comfortable and are a fraction of the cost of the others They look and feel great You will not be disappointed with these boots at all

Great to wear in the snow or on a night on the town

I purchased these for my son as a Christmas gift He loved them and wore them to dinner that evening They look good his concern fit well and keep his feet warm my concerns

Could not get my foot in side of them takes me about and extra 4 min just to get them on my feet would not buy them again

Finally got the perfect gift for my very picky 18 year old nephew he was eyeing these at the mall so I knew it would be a hit with him He claims they are lightweight and comfortable and most of all stylish

Bought for my son They are lightweight and look great on his foot Not as bulky aso Timberlands

looking sturdy and stylish

Great shoe great price and fast shipping I like the overall experience

he loves them he can wear them casually or at work

These boots are very comfortable VERY FLY

it is comfortable affordable and goes great in matching with clothes I would recommend this product to anyone

These shoes look good and feel comfortable to wear Took them to a concert and started feeling a little discomfort but all in all still a great pair of shoes

This is probably the most comfortable boots I have worn I am on cement floors 8 hours a day and oh what a difference this boot made Great on slippery floors and plenty of ankle support This is my second pair and am buying two more while there still in stock

I got the Haystack color They are very eye catching A great looking shoe for a great price

Originally I bought them for a music video but then I just wore them all the time comfortable af plus they are waterproof

These are my first pair of Nike boots I usually wear Timberland but they hurt your feet after awhile But not these Nike They are VERY comfortable and VERY stylish I got the Haystack Wheat color they look great with jeans I am very impressed and will get another pair in Black

I just ordered these as a Christmas gift for my husband these boots look even better up close and personal then it did online and they were a great price can not wait til he opens these boots up on Christmas morning = Ordering these online was easy breezy fast shipping and well boxed for shipping keep up the good work Finish line I am a very happy customer

Bought them for my son and he loves them says they are very comfortable

Great boots for all weather conditions Fights tight fits right

My wife bought me these boots 1 1 2 years ago and I am still wearing them today and they are holding up like they were new I were them at least 5 days a week they are light weight sturdy and very comfortable this is a well made boot I would highly recommend these boots to anyone that works construction or that are on your feet 8 to 12 hours a day

THE BOOTS FIT GREAT AND LOOK GOOD I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH YOUR DELIVER SERVICE I LIKE WHEN A COMPANY GOES OUT OF THERE WAY TO MAKE CUSTOMER HAPPY I am VERY HAPPY WITH FINISHLINE PRICES AND AWESOME ITEMS KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK

I ordered these thinking they were acg because that is what the boot was st and ed with on the tongue side of the sole and bottom of the sole These came plain Jane As someone said earlier there is no acg anywhere They run about just right but think I will stick to my timbs instead

pretty comfortable and stylish i can wear this boots all day long

These cool white black and red shoes are the equivalent of hot rods for your feet

Ok exceptional boots Lightweight comfy Cant comment in durability or waterproofing but these boots seem better than anything else Ive worked in but the reason for 4 stars is thet took off the acg logo on the toung and I really liked that logo I understand it didnt say nike anywhere but bring it back

They run about 1 size small other than that their great At least my wife got a new pair of shoeout the deal

First off the pictures above are slightly different from the pair I recieved Im led to believe these were a pair that had been worn and returned as well Stress marks on the sides of the sole dirt on the bottom of the sole etc In the picture the bottom of the shoe has a black triangle ACG tag thats not there on my shoes rather just a white nike logo In the picture the side of the sole has ACG st and ed on it mine again do not have that Other than that the color is slightly darker than the pictures but it looks better anyways Fit is perfect A little wide but nothing out of the ordinary Comfort is all there and they repel water very well Would give 5 5 if pictures matched my received product

This boot is super comfortable and waterproof It is a little tight without loosing the lace getting in and out but once you are in the boot it is just super comfortable

Extremely comfortable fits perfectly Could wear these day in and day out Highly recommended

Nike boots are awesome I have purchased two different styles and they are both comfortable and well made with good material

I bought these shoes to wear to work but they are apparently not made to stand on your feet all day long I have to keep taking them off when I am standing all day and take them off as soon as I get off of work

my husband wanted a casual shoe to wear and selected these He said they fit and was just what he wanted

a good product good quality very good finish that is why I choose adidas xe2 x9d xa4

Stylish and speaks to my fashion and personality Fave purchase I have made this year

I love these shoes Takes me back to the middle school days

I own around 20 pairs of superstars and from the moment I slipped these on I knew something was off My foot consistently slipped off the heal and the shell toe was too narrow I have are ordered a second pair in the same size and another a size up herehoping the fit better the second time

Grate fitting superstar shoes they look grated too

it is complete comfort with cool Even my son wants my shoes now

Quality as always is the key and I love the new colors added

Perfect fit extremely comfortable shoe looks great

This shoe is what first put adidas on the map for being known for having high quality stylish shoes To this day this shoe is still one of their best sellers and for good reason

These look rad I especially like the reflective strips

I really liked the design but once I received the shoe it fitted a little snug Had to remove the insole for it to fit Also the tab at the back rubbed on the back of my feet

The open to slide my foot into the shoe was way to narrow I have a normal size would width foot

This shoe is light and airy It feels so good when you land that you can jump again quickly I would recommend these shoes for a guard or small forward because they are light and give the right cushion while running I had no problem with sizing although it did take some effort to get the shoe on

My son loves these shoes The comfort and the fit are perfect for him

I noticed when wearing these awesome pair outside the cold weather shoe lace change to purple color Nice

Absolutely a TRASH shoe Shredded my Achilles to the point where it I had two open wounds on them HIGHLY RECOMMEND DO NOT BUY THIS SHOE unless you like not being able to run or walk without pain

After testing and buying other shoes like the why not 0 1 and why not 0 2 These shoes are the best Even though the shoe tags at the back does cause some heel discomfort these shoes are the best for this price range The impact protection is the best about the shoe and it looks great

Fell in love with the look and immediately regretted it Have worn these one time and I have blisters all over the back of my leg in my Achilles area The worst shoe ever it literally digs and scrapes the back of your leg every time you take a step You literally have to adjust your stance posture and walk in order for it to not hurt I will probably never wear these again such a waste and dissapointment

these shoes would be fine if not for one glaring design flaw the pull tab i wore them once and they tore up my heel nike does not consider it a defect because it is how the shoe was designed but multiple people have shared the same issue i wasted my money on these can not wear them and can not return them

Do not buy I was excited to get these shoes but ended up being disappointed This was the worst pair of shoes I have ever had They are hard to get on and beyond uncomfortable I wore them for one day and now have bruises on the back on my ankles I will be returning these in the mail

I have always worn a Nike 13 without any problem I have for nearly 30 years I could not wait to get this every store was sold out Only there was one problem The left shoe fit perfectly but the right had to be a good size smaller I had so much trouble getting my foot into it and when I did my toes were all bunched up in the front Never had this problem before Probably just something to consider with this shoe Shame too because I really liked the look Normally I would try them on in a store first but not a single store in the Western PA area has one in stock

it is an amazing pair of shoes but my only complain is the heel pull tab it is always hitting the back of my leg

I bought shoes from Under Armour and returned them immediately because I knew that I could find a more comfortable shoe I then decided to buy these and they came in one of the coolest boxes and arrived very quickly As for the shoes themselves they feel like socks over socks and it is amazing They are softly cushioned and provide proper ankle support The tread allows for agile cuts and breaks The shoe is meant to wrap comfortably around your foot and seems true to size They knew it may be more difficult to put on due to the material its made with so they added a spot in the back for you to hold onto while you put the shoe on My only complaint is that it is not the most eye appealing thing If you can get over this one small con for the many pros this will be the shoe for you

I returned these because they were difficult to slip on and off I imagine these are not durable enough for daily wear The sock like fit around the ankle is very tight and prevents easy on off I expect for daily sneaks Moreover the sole has an awkward slope from heel to toe making me feel as if I am constantly walking on my toes

After one week I loved the look but hated the shoe After 2It was not ok Still found myself switching shoes After 3I loved them The heel is really stiff at first but the comfort is sublime and the shoe moves really for all positions honestly

These are great shoes the flaw that it has is that the pull tabs at the heel will cut into your skin and it hurts To correct this you can use a heavy duty medium size paper clip to cl and it down for a few days to loosen it is shape Wearing low cut sock will be a problem too

The inside back heel has an unnecessary cushion that rubs on your heel causing blisters Very uncomfortable

Worst shoes I have ever owned The heel tab is super stiff and bites into your ankle which is super painful The fit is also wonky you are super snug in the heel area but in the forefoot you will always be sliding around on the footbed Do not recommend

After playing in these for about two hours at my high school I had blisters on the back of my heel and it hurt to run Very comfortable before that but painful after playing for a long time

Older player primarily a post not a ton of lateral movement but all said these shoes are amazing Initially they are a little foreign on your feet almost too soft but once you adjust they are the most comfortable basketball shoes I have ever tried I loved my KD10and have 2 pairs one was my main pair the other the backup pair and these have jumped to the1 pair As soon as I see my size come back I will order another pair

Bottom lineIf you are looking for an out of the box shoe with great traction comfort and lock down I would recommend the PG 2s or 2 5s Personally I returned these and got the PG 2 5s I am definitely much happier and far more pleased in the very noticeable performance between the two shoes An added bonus is the PG 2 5s are 40 less For anybody that is looking to find honest performance reviews I would recommend Wear Testers I do not work for them nor am I affiliated but I wish I had taken their review more seriously of the KD 11s before purchasing This is why I have given these a 2 star review

This is hands down the best cushioning system put on a shoe Period There is not anything better out there

Rear heal design or construction creates gashes Extremely painful design

I love this shoe but I hate KD for being a Snake KD earned my respect but I still do not like him Sorry Warriors Fans I am not a Lebron Fan His shoe is great tho I would recommend to but it It is great

Right out of the bag these shoes are great other than the heel tab is digging into my heels I used bandaids and extra socks but nothing helped I have had them for about a week and a half and it is still super stiff So do not get these if you do not have time to break them in Also these shoes are kinda heavy for a quick guard

Purchased the shoe and loved the look and setup of the shoe The cushion seems nice and not broken in when new but felt great after a few wears I wore them as a casual shoe till i was able to be in the gym and let them loose I usually wear size 13 shoes and it was true to size for the most part The right shoe seemed really snag but figured it needed to break in Im 6 4 245 build and play both foward postions and was finally able to hoop in them this weekend Again the cushion at this point was and is great but when it was time to run and ball it was a different story Again the right shoe was already snug as soon as they were laced up and ran once down the court i started to feel some pain It went away partially but figured id just break them to break in some more Lateral movement caused forefoot movement and felt like i was about to fall of the shoe Cushion was great traction was great but the lateral lockdown wasnt and pain from wearing them is causing me to return the shoes Lucky enough i have my lebron 15 lows on hand and finished off the day in those Good shoe overall but not for balling for me

Wow is the word for these These are even mor comfortable than the Lebron 15 I did not see that coming Overall extra comfy and bouncy I have not played in them yet But i will grab another colorway to do that in Btw they are stylish too

The traction has a great performance in clean courts but in dirty and outdoors is good

One of the shoes has an annoying squeak no matter what I do The noise is so loud that I do not think I will wear them again

Most comfortable shoes that I have every bought Very lightweight and soft Very happy with this purchase

I am a drummer they are very comfortable to walk in and to play the drums in

these bad boys Just a shoe that for me nailed it

I brought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loved them Tried them on immediately and he refused to take them off Super comfy I highly recommend these shoes

The shoes are awesome but could use a little more color to make the shoe pop If it displayed added more of the olive green possibly to the toe crown and or the sole of the shoe to make it more alluring to shoppers

My daughter recommended the shoe to me She wanted me to be more stylish I ordered the shoe and was amazed at how comfortable shoe is The bottom feels high which takes getting used to

Excellent deal for these kicks Quality shoe I use them for working out Fast shipping speed

These shoes are one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever worn I could wear them all day They do run about a full size small So keep that in mind when ordering

My son loves the fit and style He said the color is great it goes with everything

I needed a new white shoe that was comfy at the same time and this was the show for that I am pro hurrache

The Hurricane is the most comfortable and durable sneakers I have purchased in a very long time and with them being NikeI love them I usually buy New Balance for comfort and width but the Hurricane is dead on

Bought a pair for my boyfriend and he is in love with it All he talks about is how comfy they are I am definitely pro huarache

Got these for my 14 year old son he loves them wears them everyday

I got these for my bf for carnival they match beautifully with his costume really sorry it did not have the color in a female size for me it was his first pair of huaraches and he loves very comfortable size was perfect true to size he intends on getting some of the colors available

These shoes are comfortable and useful I enjoy wearing these daily

I have had my eyes on these Huarachefor quite some time and Finish Line had the best price These are the most comfortable and coolest shoes I own Would highly recommend them to anyone

Love them love the style the fit THEY ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE The color ways are choice I have bought two different pairs so far and keep eyeing a third or fourth Nike killed it with this release

These sneakers are a lot more comfortable than I expected I bought these just to wear with an outfit and now I am wearing them all the time Got them on sale too added bonus

Great shoe for casual wear and gym workouts I would not recommend shoe for runs over a mile or two Shoe runs true to size both length and width Neoprene sleeve is extremely comfortable and the midsole is a nice mix of support and comfort Purchased the siren red black white and love the unique look pop of color it is simply a unique retro inspired style that gets noticed at the gym or casually

I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them So much that he went and purchased the triple black pair The only downside was they were a tad to small although we ordered true to his size

Bought these for my father thinking he wore my size He needed a half size bigger so I kept them for myself So glad I did because they are the most comfortable casual footwear I have ever had on They work well with all day wear unlike some elite running shoes that you can only take an hour or two Great buy with finish line having them for only 90 00

Shoes were definitely worn could see the outline of toe marks on the insole from sweat being worn with out socks Outsole was also dirty brown on both shoes Was very hyped about finding the colorway in my size so I was pretty disappointed

Bought this while it was on sale and I can say I definitely got my moneyworth Super comfortable shoe while also stylish and functional I recommend this to anyone who is thinking about buying it

Out of many many experimental Nike purchases this is my gold mine they are like walking on a cloud

He wears a 9 5 had to buy 10 5 Very comfortable shoes Second pair

True to size I thought I would need a bigger size so mines fit a lil to big but I love them

I walk ten thousand steps a day The Ulta Air Huarache is the most comfortable work shoe I have worn The shoes are a great value when you need performance and comfort

In my opinion this version of the huaraches are more comfortable than the original version

shipped pretty fast and were clean white Good deal and run 5 size smaller So order 5 size up when ordering

it is my second time wearing them and I REALLY hate the fact that they sqeek when I walk what a waste of money for this one I REALLY would like a new pair

I bought shoes as a gift and got comments from the person who I gave them to He said they were very careful and he wore them to the amusement park the following day and had no problems with his feet he said they were very comfortable

they are super comfortable and slip right on they are stretchy by the ankle and have great cushion plus they look dope i got the all white ones

Horrible Material ripped after a week of use Stay away not worth the money

I bought the shoe for later on in the year to wear with my jogging outfit Out the box they look great and are comfortable

Nice looking sneaker and can wear with almost anything

I loved these I wear them all day for work and they are so comfy

I recommend any and everyone to buy this shoe It is the most comfortable shoe I ever had I also purchased another pair

Love my nikes very comfortable shoes to wear could not ask for better deal on these great nikes

I love these shoes so much that I had to buy my fiancee some it is hard to find comfortable workout shoes These really past the test

I love the shoes very comfortable I will buying more from you guys Your stores are great

Had to go up a size the size im use to felt really tight and had to get my foot through but once i got the correct size it fit good Shoe is a bit narrow on the side of the toes but with constant wear and walking in them it opens up

I ordered these shoes in black primarily for form instead of function they are great almost anywhere and easily match with anything The shoes are very comfortable and most days I reach for these almost feels like you are wearing a sock and they are super easy to slip on and off

I have had this shoe for quite some time and it has held up great and I am pretty hard on shoes the toe cap has helped a lot it is also very comfortable for just walking or running Or wearing for style

Nice fit super comfortable highly recommend Great look with jeans or casual wear nice workout kiks

It makes more noises than any cheaper mark that you can buy in the flea market in Miami

Bought these badass shoes but was disappointed when they arrived in my mail box they have a snug fitting and run too narrow I had to return it for a direct pair The shoes look good and can be used for casual wear as well as training can not wait for my new pair tho

Got a pair in all black Decent sneakers lovely mesh material makes it very breathable for your feet Very nice looking as well

I recommend this shoe to anyone that runs going to purchase another pair

the best sneakers so good I have to buy another pair had the customed the first pair but the letters came out like the first month this time just all black and its perfect

This product has great features Please allow for customize colors etc

Buy buy buy people You will not be disappointed Comfy not too chunky like some other huaraches in the past Super light and runs true to Nike sizes

This shoe is awesome to look at and awesome to walk in EVERYONE LOVES IT THANKS NIKE

Love these shoes great looking and super comfortable already ordered a second pair

I just received my shoes and I must say they are quite comfortable and stylish I have only worn them once and have received so many compliments I look forward to possibly purchasing more orders for the summer This is definitely a must have shoe

These shoes are really comfortable but mine squeak every time i walk it is so annoying of a sound It sounds like I have water in my shoes I have had many people tell me how annoying it is and how they can hear them in the hallway 10 10 would not buy these

Nice look and feel but the colorway got dirty pretty quick Overall good shoe

Very happy with this purchase Just recently became obsessed with buying shoes I must say that this shoe is very stylish comfortable and a reasonable price This shoe lives up to the hype it brings could not be happier

I rarely do these reviews but I had to leave my 2 cents jajaj came looking for some red ones for my boyfriend for vday but did not find but I will buy any color because I know he will love them they curve against your feet as you run really sturdy

I found this product very comfortable and I wear it almost every day I love this show so much I recommend buying it Especially for the price its at

It is hard to describe the way the Nike Air Huarache Ultra fits if you have never worn any of Nikemore recent sneaker styles The collar clings snugly around the ankle and shows no signs of deformation so far even after taking the shoes on a short run The heel cage which might strike some as whimsical and a tad bit excessive serves as a surprisingly supportive link between the upper and the sole The elastic strap that runs across the upper heel adds an added layer of flexibility and comfort while still allowing the wearer to pull the fully laced shoe off and on using the ergonomically successful pull loops Even after a few weeks of use the midsole shows minimal signs of rippling or wear

This is the best shoe i ever had very light and the best out of the other nike shoes

This shoe is very comfortable and I just love it i could not have ordered a better pair of sneakers

I had higher expectations for these shoes They are comfortable but not as comfortable as I expected Still a very nice shoe and look phenomenal

I agree It looks comfortable very durable and very strong

just to let you know they run small I wear a size 13 and needed a 14 in my Huarache very comfortable shoes

I really like how my shoes fit on my feet and how comfortable they are

This is a great shoe for my 13 yr old son and it fits true to size and wears well

These shoes are great They are very comfortable and look great They are hard to keep clean because I got the white ones but they are the best shoes Ive ever had

Very Comfortable could wear all day Love this new runnning shoes

The shoe comes in a variety of colors including my favorite blue and black It matches with casual or athletic dress and can even be worn to the gym if I do not want to swap shoes I can wear them comfortably all day

This is a comfortable shoe with a nice color way and all around design

bought these for my son who is super picky and he loves them he is amazed at how comfy they are with their stylish design and color they are a 5 in my book

Got my shoes very fast no problems fit just perfect very comfortable would not choose any other brand over NIKE they really make sure customer is happy and satisfied

They feel great at first they could be a little tight but there still comfortable

This is a very comfortable stylish shoe I would not recommend running hard in it but I would recommend it

I bought these because they were the color of my high school alma mater and I like the design the of the shoe But when I tried them on the comfort took me by storm Nike did a great job for this shoe comfort and design that my 5yr old son want a pair as well The only disadvantage is that you have to get a half size bigger and since I am 5 10 and have to wear a size 10 shoe makes my feet look awkward long Other than I have complaints on the shoe and will be goin back to get the all white and all black pair and maybe order a custom pair

I was soooo excited to get this shoe But its not comfortable I love the design and the shoe its self but my feet are killing me

These shoes are really comfortable and I like how easy they are to put on

These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly only issue I would say is that there is no support and they feel very flimsy and delicate but other than that I rate 5 5

I was in between sizes the toe box has too much room on the top of the shoe Not good for narrow feet I wish I could of kept they felt nice and look fresh

Bought as a gift Loved them Highly recommend

Awesome all around I was impressed with the shoe I will buy more in the future

I love the shoes great fitting and looks I like the color and shape

Its pretty good and stylish too the materials are also of high quality

but runs a little wide at the toe area lightweight form staying material

Nice summer wear or any event I wore it to a party Everyone in love with it

I have had these shoes for over 2 weeks and currently own over 30 pairs of Nikes from lebrons to air max to free runs and I have worn these 10 out of the last 14 days I have to say these are the most comfortable pair of huaraches Ive worn and Ive worn many Great job Nike

The shoe is very comfortable and stylish Recommend to buy it

Loved these shoes since they originated in the 90s Love them even more now that more colors exist Highly recommended

These trainers are awesome great product and would sincerely recommend to anyone who is serious about comfortable shoes with great foot support

These are my first pair of huraches and they are super comfortable I use them for walking around the neighborhood with my newborn and goin around town I plan on purchasing more in diff colors Cant beat these also cause I got them on clearance

I love this shoe thank you Nike for bringing it back Fits like a glove and extremely easy to put on and take off

The shoes that I got were good for going out and other Ect

I wore the shoes up and down the Las Vegas strip Comfortable the whole time

This is an awesome shoe and I would recommend it

Comfortable but small and snug Great style and very aerodynamic

This is a very light shoe and very comfortable

Stylish I have about 3 pairs of huaraches and plan on buying many more

The shoes fit well and also very comfortable and the price is right

Best shoe I have found for my bad back So far there is no other shoe that can and its amazing that now I can focus on some weight loss without so much pain

I love the fit of hurarche sneakers The look is sleek and fun to wear

The shoes are perfect for casual walking and stylish over all 10 10

Use the shoe to work out and when going out and its great

I ordered this product a few weeks ago and the shipping was on time When i took them out the box i was like awww man too much purple on the back and i examined them then put them on Mann they are so comfortable i could of fell to sleep with them on So i was able to overlook the purple on the back and enjoy them Thank you nike for another great productloyalsincebirth

One of my favorit shoes very comfortable been wearing this shoe everyday from the mail box to the store to the gym well worth the price great shoe

Not just a Great Style of colors but also a Comfort that an average person can enjoy That person that likes something Nice on there Feet and look good wearing them

Glad to see these sneakers come back for the summer Comfortable fashionable and affordable

Love the New Nike Huarache Ultra with its comfortably and lite weight feel this shoe needs more colors or Nike must make custom ID for this Ultra lite weight platform

Big fan of Hurache due to style and how comfortable they are I own two pairs of the regular ones in a mens 11 Now when it comes to the ultra im a mens 9 since they are wide around the toe area but i find the ultra more comfortable then the regular ones and also they make the feet look alot smaller due to its slimmer style I definitely will be purchasing another pair of the ultras

This is by far the most comfortable pair of shoe I own its stylish and easy to slip on unlike the orig huaraches

This shoe is so comfortable I bought shoe last week and is came in only 2 days The shoe is very comfortable its self The design is amazing I love the colors The fabric is really nice and the soul is very nice I love the design of huarache ultras I would defiantly buy this in another color

Some of the most comfortable shoes i ever had very light weight definitely will be ordering more pairs

These were my first pair of Huaraches so I would not know how the Regular Huaraches fit or feel but these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had I use them for running and cage work baseball very durable and look really good too 10 10 would recommend

Compared to the regular Huarache shoes I would say the benefit of these is that the material is slightly more lightweight and breathable I do not notice much difference in the cushioning These shoes do fit more true to size than the regular Huaraches which run a little small I have not worn them enough to say much about durability but then again I have never had a durability issue with my Nike shoes

First off just let me say NICE Well constructed shoe I was very satisfied with the appearance They look better in person once you get them in hand Secondly they do have a slightly wider toe box than the OG huarache run so people with a wider foot can appreciate them Third like the OGs order a half size up I wear a 12 5 and have to get a 13 But in this shoe they seem to have a lil more length so a full size may not be required since they do have a slightly wider toe box Last but not least these sneakers do not have the OG soft cushioning There more of a medium firm soft fell but still comfortable

I am a Woman and Beautician and i did not like the style of the women shox so i thought i would try the MenI wear size 10 in women so i got size 8 5 I LOVE these shoes I stand all day doing hair and these are by far the BEST pair i have ever bought Im 47 and have ONLY worn Nike shoes since 1982 so i can not compare any other brand of tennis shoes I normally buy the expensive women air max and for some reason the top mesh cloth rips by my big toes so i decided to try the mens leather Shox A

I left Nike shox for awhile and tried something else major mistake These sneakers are great to run in and you can feel it when running I only use these sneakers for running and they are also made very well Infact I got two pair all black for the fall winter time and white and silver for the sping summer time

The shoe feels wonderfullike walking on a blanket

I have many Nike Shocks and they are all Leather made these feel like vinyl or some other type of material but not leather I will be returning this product Not worth my money Nike shocks used to be really nice shoes not anymore or I guess not ALL shocks are the same

Shoes also retain tons of heat could not image running in them

it is does not fit me comfortably as front part is to much congested for my leg so its not reflexively fits at all Hope so get replaced as purchased it from online store

Its a stylish and also its comfortable shoejust bought them today wearing them in the house with pajamas

Have several pair Love them all Easy to clean magic eraser Only issue is some can be a little narrow at first but will eventually stretch out a bit

Ordered Nike shox for my husband for Christmas to only get a used pair in the mail with gum stuck on the bottom Who sends something out like thatShows they could care less about what they ship Customer service was rude to me I asked for a refund and was told they could give me 10 Will never buy from them again

These shoes are wearing out faster then any shoes I have ever had Normal walking everyday only two weeks old and the heels are already down to the nub Totally unacceptable I paid 148 dollars for these shoes including tax shipping They are very comfortable but what good are they if they will not last no more than a few weeks

I bought these shoes and Finishline sent me one that was yellow and one that was white I called to return them and they still have not sent me a call tag

All I have to say is that I only buy Shox Great Shoe

Add 1 size up from your normal Nike shoe size These shoes run very narrow and tight

Nice looking nice design little tight

I love Nike Shox This Shoe is very comfortable Im a diabetic and this shoe gives me all the support I need and I look good wearing them I want all colors I have 2 pair and workin on the 3rd

This shoe is very comfortable The sizing is perfect as well I would definitely recommend to anyone

Bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them Got them to match a couple of outfits

I loved my very first pair of Shox several years ago Looking for a change I tried several different sneakers and brand names Nike Shox are the best shoe for me Number one they are always classy looking They fit like they were made for me I am happy to be back wearing the best running shoe

Had to return and I received a prompt no hassle refund

I love shox and have several pair Shox are really not for running as labeled They are to heavy for running and more for styling and profiling If you want a true running shoe try another Nike style

The brown leather Nike Shox are a casual preformance I had a yesteryear generation model too in sport black which were much more of a trainer shoe due to the matierals it was constructed from These in brown leather are great comfortable snug fit aggressive stance and promote stability and posture And the brown leather is unique to catch an eye for style

Fit is true to size Colors materials coordinate well Quality workmenship

I wanted these back in 95 but could not afford them Now I can Shoe feels great and wears well in a day

Really nice snickers would recommend Great fit and great look to it

This shoe must have been tested or trialed by someone who has a rabbit shaped foot as it is way too snug and tight in mid sole the shoe is very uncomfortable even with socks on and even if you tighten laces on top it still does not remain snug around ankle Uncomfortable to walk train in

I had bought these originally for my son and these particular sandals run small so I bought bigger and they were too big So I just gave them to my fiance and bought another pair for my son They both have a pair and love them

Brought 2 pair one for my brother and another for my husband Both loved them

This is the 2nd pair I have purchased for my son to wear to and from his football practice and games These are the only slides he will wear They are very comfortable and we absolutely recommend them

VERY COMFORTABLE and eASY TO SLIP INTO I CAN WEAR THEM ALL DAY IF I CHOOSE

These slides are great Although I liked the first design better these slides are very comfortable and worth the buy I definitely recommend getting these slides if you are looking for some new ones

I purchased these for my vacation to Mexico I wore them on the beach I wore them when I went walking they felt so good I found myself wearing them for hours at a time the price was perfect the style was great the color was right the feel was nice

I bought these slides for my son to get to and from basketball practice He absolutely LOVES these slides They are very comfortable and the slides stay on his narrow feet I was hesitant on ordering something that i have not put my hands on in the store I am glad that I did

Honestly better than most Jordan sandals I love it Keep continuing the style and comfort

This slides are super soft I have bought so many slides and none came to be as soft as this ones I defenetly recommend

Best sandal ive bought in years Always went with what was on sale and this time I spent a little more than I wanted but easily the best purchase I have ever made I wear them 24 7 if I am not at work Love it

Bought these sandals for my husband as a xmas gift Of course he got them before Christmas and he loves them they are extremely comfortable I am now wondering if they make these for women

Great buy had a 20 coupon so I only paid for shipping Look great and comfortable

Not sure about the size comments I wear a 11 5 12 and ordered a 12 Too big so I returned for an 11 perfect Basic comfort and nice styling

Only glue on the side No stitches I even tried gluing the sandals

This is a big upgrade in comfort from the original

Great slide and very comfortable for any time you choose to not wear shoes I highly recommend this slide

these Slides are pretty comfortable I just use them for walking around the house The cushion is A 1 straps a little tight kind of wish it was adjustable but overall the comfort and cushion are a great job by Nike And Im an OG now so I am all about cushion

These are for my Grandson who is 17 He has been wearing Nike slides for about 4 5 years now He wears a size 15 shoe and they are hard to find Buying online is so much easier than finding in any store I order early and he gets enough to last the season Thanks Nike

It looks great and feels great Very durable and is overall great

Love this slide very comfortable easy to put on off I wear it all the time around the house Got couple of pairs for family and friends as well

This product is very comfortable but just do not hold up at all I wore them around for one day and they started ripping

These were the most comfortable shoes Ive ever worn they were great Had them for about 2 months before the side jsut came off not sure if they were not glued well of what but I hardly wore them while I had them and already are broken

Very comfortable a little narrow feel but the soles are great I can walk a lot without being uncomfortable

These are really cool slides I have narrow feet and they fit really nice The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because when they get wet they get really slippery not the bottom of the slides but the bottom of your feet slips when you walk

This slide is very comfortable and exceeded every expectation Saying that it is a tad narrow especially if being worn with socks But its not unbearable

The Product has a great feel The solar soft material sets it apart from other slides

Got these for my husband on Fathers Day and he loved them The color is great and they are very comfortable

I saw Gronk rockin these in the latest issue of GQ and I had to pick them up Summer is here we all want to hit the bars and the lake and these slides are great at both they are stylish and are so dang comfortable and the fit is amazing Nike your design team killed it with these

Super comfortable and fits true to size Would definitely recommend

Product fells great on my feet cant complain great material good quality

One of the most slides that i ever wear very comfortable very stylish and plus with a great price I promise you wont regreat

Excellent product very comfortable I strongly recommend it

The slides feel comfortable and are great for hanging around and doing anything I wear them just about anywhere I go The design is sleek with the black leather strap and comfortable bottom They fit just fine and I have no trouble walking in them I would highly recommend these slides to anyone

Very comfortable and stylish The solar soft compresses a lot giving maximum comfort when wearing

I usually just wear them for fashion and comfort and they do that just well

I have been buying flip flops for my sons and husband for some time now We were at foot locker and the employee said they should try the Benassi Solarsoft so we bought 3 pairs Now it is the only flip flop they wear It is very stylish and super comfortable What makes the flip flop so comfortable are the following reasons It has more padding on the one strap so eliminates and discomfort you might and rubbing like other flip flops cause the flex grooves allow your foot to move more naturally and does not have the stiff feeling other flip flops fell like and lastly the midsole has extra padding and the footbed soft cushioning Feels like you are walking with slippers not stiff flip flops Would never buy anything else for my boys

These are the perfect size and the color was great I get compliments every time I wear them

Slipperes fit great and look great couldnt be happier with this purchase

Good slide good purchase will get another pair later

Cery comfortable and fit great i love these shoes bery much

They are a nice fit though maybe a little on the large side they are pretty comfortable and a nice cushioned feel I would recommend these to anyone who looking for a nice casual slide

This product is very comfortable Fits great and has good grip

My college aged son loves these He got the black ones and thinks they look awesome feel great He talks about how comfortable they are and really enjoys wearing them

This slip on is perfect for everyone I recently bought every person in my family a pair for xmas and they cant get over the comfort fit and ease that they have come to expect from Nike Perfect 10

I love these They are soooooo comfortable I suggest everyone buy some

Good job

The best flip flop ever maid Very flexible durable and good looking

Thank you

I have had them for a week now and I am pretty pleased The quality and price of these made it all worth it If you buy this slipper true to size and you put your whole foot in the slipper as in toes all the way in it is not comfortable on the bridge of your foot

I love these slides The fabric is comfortable and made so that the shoe stays in place on your foot These are great for sliding something on quickly to go run an errand get the mail or go on a short walk I recommend them highly

This product has a very slick and sharp design on it that I like a lot

I love this product it fits well and everyone tells me they like them Ans wants to know where got them from

This product was really comfortable and at a great price point Thank you

I purchased the Benassi Solarsofts recently and I have to preach how amazing they are I play tackle football and after practice I slip my slides on and BOOM Relief These slides are easy to carry in my football bag and are worth every dollar

The strap that holds you are feet are a little tight other then that great

I have had many slides before but these take the crown They are durable and really comfortable 10 10 will buy again

I use these guys primarily when I wake up or get ready to go to bed They are a great slipper sandal to wear with socks or without

I originally ordered this product for its look But after using for two week now I have to say it super soft and comfortable I did buy a size up size 11 my original size is 10 5 I am still in the dark regarding its durability as I have only had it for a week

My feet feel like I have gently kidnapped two clouds and strapped them to my feet With every step my feet sing in comfort In fact you can hear them scream much like lobsters when I put them into shoes counting down the hours until they are reunited with cloud city Plus no longer do my feet feel ugly as the fit style look has turned them into the belles of the ball Their level of self confidence is at an all time high with each toe wiggling in harmonious joy

Love these shoes They are soft and super comfortable

this is for my son he loves the style and the comfort I am pleased with being able to find 1

Feels like youre walking on pillows I highly recommend these

This slide is perfect for relaxing and getting around Very durable and comfortable I love the foam under the strap I work from home so I wear them every morning for a few hours No discomforts at all

These slides have the same comfort and quality I have grown to expect from Nike Excellent quality and comfort Absolutely love them

Loving it comfy soft and manly slippers on the go

This product has comfort that exceeds my expectations Would highly recommend them to a friend

These are very comfortable and very great on my feet since I have to have shoes or sandles that have Cushing in them

A super soft slider that looks good and makes my feet feel like it is dreaming

I literally wear these sandals all day everyday I wear them in my house and when i go out I only take them off when I go in my room it is better than walking barefoot or in socks on hardfloor Great cushioning with every step Highly recommended for anyone

An upgraded version of the original benassi sandal The material is well cushioned and comfortable walking in Very snug and fitted True to size

Shoes are awesome Boyfriend was certainly very happy with my surprise He loves them

I wear these before and after my soccer matches They are super soft and comfy on the drive over As well as soothingly soft on the way home They are also good around the house I highly recommend them to anyone

It soft and very light Easy to fit Great

I like these slides for wearing around the house or if i have to go somewhere quick when I am not ballin

These shoes are comfortable and durable They run a little small but that is not a big deal These are definitely better than the first Solarsoft slides

I do not run in these shoes I wear them post run and whenever I need a comfortable shoe to walk around in Can be worn with or without socks and still maintain comfort level Well worth the price

Easy to fit in and there comfortable Makes you want to keep on using them

This slide offers extremely comfortable fit great support and can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort

These are the most comfortable slides I have ever worn It feels like you are walking on sand Slightly more expensive than the standard sandals but they are definitely worth it

I would recommend it

I like this new solar soft soles on these I have owned other slides in the past but these are much more comfortable

These sandals are amazing My boyfriend thinks they are super comfortable easy to walk in and they look good

I wanted something comfortable and simple and this does the job but when i wear it with socks its tight but with just my bear feet it fits perfectly

Bought these for my groomsmen for my wedding Everybody loved them and wore them all week in Hawaii

I never believed sandals could be this comfortable until I purchased the Benassi sandals above do not let the simplicity of its looks fool you Its sleek design yet stable feel are winners for me Nike has really out done themselves with this one I am glad I made this investment

These sandles are so comfy With the size chart I was able to get the shoe at the exact size needed Fits perfectly

I bought these to wear before and after golf

Overall these are very comfortable I wear them before and after basketball games as well as casually The cushioning of the midsole is great for recovery after a long basketball game and also gives great support for casual wear I would definitely recommend this product

Fits perfect just if you are a size 10 buy a size up 11 B3uy I size bigger that is all But fits great

I really like how ambiguous the colors look and I like how they can be a multipurpose shoe Great high quality material I am always excited to wear them

I love it

They are the most uncomfortable air max I have ever worn My feet hurt minutes into wearing them and the tops of my toes and my ankles are all blistered I went true to size and the toe box is crammed but the heel area is loose and slips off without tightening my laces tighter than normal absolutely a terrible shoe

Size color and shape is great for this but sole on these is very hard Can not use this for more than 20 mins at a time Started hurting my feet very quickly Hoping for better comfortable sole but got a hard sole which not I could not return

This shoe is not for people who have flat feet The insole is way to high and make your walk uncomfortable unless worn with sock I personally do not think sandals and socks go together

Clean comfortable slide buikt better than the Nike slides everyone has They did run a little small for me so I recommend going a half size up Other than that they are a well built sandal

I am so happy I got these slides I love them The look and feel are awesome

I absolute love these slides They do not run quite as comfortable or have as soft a feel like the Nike Slides however Adidas makes up for that in strength space and durability These shoes are very generous in size allowing your feet to spread comfortably maybe a little too much in some cases I also really like the style and color scheme I think the biggest issue some people may run into is the sizing because they run kind of wide Other than that a great buy I would recommend

Read the previous reviews so I bought mine a 1 2 size larger Now I like them

good fit but a little tight if you have wider feet also get a size bigger than your normal shoe size

The foot placement does not fit my foot Where my foot feels comfortable in the sole then the band it too big

Loves adidas gets it from her Dad

So growing up and playing soccer I was never without my favorite and most comfortable Adidas Flip Flops Years I would never purchase anything else Finally I had to trash my last pair because they were so worn out 20 years later I saw these assumed amazing flip flops again I had to purchase them even thought they were like 25 bucks more than what I remember to be but I did it anyways anticipating their delivery As soon as I put them on I noticed a huge difference in the discomfort of the shoe They were hard did not have a comfortable hug to your foot and as I walk they keep flying off my feet Now this has never happened to me before with these shoes So I thought if I keep wearing them I would get use to them but that has not happened yet Sometimes I get bruises on the top of my feet because the material is so abrasive Super sad about the waste of money and how the company decided not to continue with comfort of this brand and shoe

Very comfortable and long lasting Dries up quickly when wet

Like it and fit perfectly and the color was good

Classic style and color Very comfortable and durable

Nice shoe but you must go up a size I usually wear a 6 but got a 7 I really wish they came in half sizes because 1 size makes the shoe very wide But still a good buy

Great product nice looking The fit is half size big

Very comfortable and stylish Great for summer and early fall

My husband love the product however he prefers a larger size

They are good but I feel them to big and 6 was to small

These are great slides They are comfortable and durable I definitely recommend them

I like the product because they look great with my adidas socks

A great slide for after games or the house They run big so order a size down

This particular style has always been a classic I also own a pair in black and white

Thesse slides are extremely comfortable and the sleek design is vert nice

A little small for my foot I have a wide flat foot and these are not the best for that

I love them so comfy and I can use them practically for everything

These slides are well made This time they are not made in Vietnam or China These are made in Italy Very durable but if you are looking for a more comfortable slide the Cloudfoam are the best

pretty cool i like the color if it cheaper i will like it more

I agree with ordering 1 size up I bought it for my friend as a birthday gift He wears 11 and the 12 fits perfectly Quality is really nice Looks very sleek

Looks smart and is comfortable Perfect size and quality is great

The quality that defines the three stripes never dissapoints across all fields these slides included

It is comfortable and looks good The white and black mixture is the color scheme I suggest

Perfect for after the gym or just to chill Definitely recommend

Great color and a perfect size Matches with almost anything as well

I love Adidas best products I ever had I will buying this product all the time

I got my regular size that I get in sneakers and they fit perfect Very comfortable

The perfect slides Crazy comfortable fit perfectly and add a little funky flare to any outfit Love wearing them around the house or out and about Easily my favorite pair of slides I have ever purchased

Super comfortable Great looking Love them So happy I purchased

do not get a size up I am a size 9 and i got a size 10 and they were very large on my feet in fact I am ordering a 9 right now and once I get them I will write if they are a good fit or if they are too big as well

Definitely comfortable and made well Easy to slip on and durable

I like them because I can just slip them on and go Very simple and easy

Perfect for teenage boy for upcoming vacation He is very happy with the slides

Great classic Adilette slides They are comfortable They are great for wearing with shorts or sweats Great for wearing to the pool and putting on after team practice I highly recommend them

Very comfortable product fits perfectly and meets my standards

These are by far the best pair of sandals that I have owned by mile Very comfortable and reliable foot wear

Super cute and comfy but they do run about a half size small

The looks and comfort of the original adilette slide

The first pair of these I owned for over a decadefinally needed new ones I was worried about the break in period as my original pair rub the top of my foot causing some discomfort Adidas fixed that issue and they already feel like my old ones did These are good overall sandals to wear for any casual occasion

I bought these slides to mostly wear around the house while doing chores since my ancient moccasin slippers were killing my feet The arch support and sturdy footbeds have helped so much I am wearing them with socks now since it is cold but will probably wear them out all the time this summer since they are so comfortable and durable Absolutely reccomend

Love them look feel size all good Replaced a previous pair and the white pops

Like the product because it is very comfortable and the quality is very good

To had so cushion and not the size I ordered it should have came in multiple colors

I like the style and Quality3rd pair I have purchased as I like the color schemethank you Lance

Wanted them to wear around campus with socks I wear a women6 6 5 I ordered the men5 Fit perfectly Seem sturdy enough Pretty comfy

my husband is replacing his adilettes after 15 5 years and our son is on board for the same sense of style and comfort highly recommend them

classic Adidas creating a timeless piece that blurs the boundary between stylish and relax

This item runs large I cannot honestly recommend

Only buy if you do so in person and can try them on

The size is a little too small not actually true to size

I love the look of these on feet Great feel and comfort

Great product delivery was great really good quality

Slides fit great and are very comfortable I wear them in the gym locker room to and from the shower They are non slip and they dry very quickly

Great slides fits perfectly if you get your right size

it is fits me right very comfortable and clean look

people always comment on these the color really stands out real gold

My Wife Loves these will be purchasing more The Quality is Awesome and the prices are amazing

The fit is perfect for my foot Plus I like the firmness of the sole

Adidas is my go to for any clothes products just nice

Love love love them I am obsessed with them and bought the for my son and husband as well

looks good feels great top quality Great selection of colors as well

This is a great sandal choice for anyone looking for some slippers to put on after a game or for home Comfy and very good quality

The best slippers out there They are comfortable sturdy and true to size The bottom is harder and not foam which makes them feel like they will last for a long time The harder bottom makes for a better support as well

My boyfriend loved them they are comfortable and perfect fitting

Love it Original color and great quality Size down per website recommendations

I have owned several pairs of these slides and would recommend them

These slides are the most durable I have ever used After two months looking at the shoe there is no wrinkling scratching or wear I recommend 5 5

It is my one of the best slippers

Shoes were as hard as a rock Zero comfort and slippery



Does exactly what its supposed to do Feels right

Must have for college dorm life These are perfect for everyday use Love the bright color

This is very comfortable and durable I will get these again

I loved these slides they are very comfortable I recommend this for people participating in water sports such as water polo swimming and rowing as they are waterproof it is also surprising how well these slides fit and mould to the shape of your foot This allows them not to fall of your feet while walking

My 6th pair of adilette so I am aware or the breaking in process They will rub against your toe area and may blister when they are new if walked in alot Can possibly avoid by wearing socks It goes away after a while so I just suck it up lol Overall love love

the shoes is comfortable and functional and I like the style

These slides are the most comfortable slides I have ever worn

just doesnt fit perfectly maybe i have to break it in some more overall very stylish

The pictures that are promoted for the slides seem to indicate that the slides are unisex even if they are listed as men but finding the correct size is impossible The men and womens sizes differ by only one size on the size chart but the other reviews highly suggest getting a size larger than what you would normally get The first time I ordered I chose what I would normally fit into and then a size larger which ended up being way to big The second time I ordered smaller and they were still too big and the top of the shoe pinches your toes If you are ordering online which is what I had to do because no stores near me had them do not waste your time trying to figure out sizes

I was looking for this sandals and I found the most amazing colors I bought the red and yellow Very fashion

I have slim feet it is too wide for me to barely walking with them on my feet I used to have the Adidas by stella slides which is a perfect fit fot slim feet

These are simply perfect I wear them with socks in winter and on their own in summer Adilettes are essential in my life

Very durable and comfortable and perfect for casual and sport wear

Get many compliments and breathable Bought some for my kids

these are awesome slides a lil hard to get used to at first since the texture is harder than i thought it would be but i was lucky enough for them to fit me perfectly if you are a female make sure to get your pair in male shoe size

Sent me the wrong product Returned and got my money back

These slides I have worn for three weeks now they are still like new The insole has great arch support keeping my feet from going flat The undersole has great traction and grip great for walking around the house They are easy to clean after doing various tasks 5 5

Good looking perfect match I will recommend this friends and I will buy more relatives

stylish comfortable and flashy I am not disappointed at all

This is definitely for a girl on the go you need to go to the beach wear your Adidas slides Do you need to go to the supermarket to pick up some breadThese are the shoes to do it Gives a casual appeal fo any outfit and is comfortable The color is amazing and I could not be any happier with the shoes Although maybe get it in a size larger because they do tend to run small

Nice color also

I enjoy the product and color and style My issue is the sizing which is way too big I can hardly walk in the slides I am a size 7 5 8 and I heard they ran small so I went and ordered a size 8 I recently ordered my husband the same model in a size 11 and he is a size 10 and his fit perfectly I understand I can not return a custom order but I truly think I was sent a men size Unfortunately I am disappointed because I can not exchange or wear the ones sent

This item is perfect I like it very much and I recommend it

Too Hard really thought they would be soft but they are very very stiff Is this normal

they are great Fits nice and are attractive to look at Three stripes all the way

Is very confortable and the color is nice and rich

Because they have a foot mold to them they take a while to get used to

It is super hard like i thought it would be soft but nah It still comfy but not as soft as other slides it kinda feels like the eqt adv butt he materials are super good Recommend going a half size of full size up im usually a 9 or 9 5 and i got a 10 and it was perfect

They are very comfortable Unfortunately the 10US was too small and 11US a little bigger But love it

The size was just right the way they fit your feet is great and the color is not dull at all

The Adidas slides are fashionable and extremely comfortable

One thing I wish you would change is the color and material under the strap Please change it back to what it used to be white Also the material was or looked like it was cotton I uploaded a pair of my old sandals where you can see the white a little bit Sorry my dog likes to eat my sandals

My boyfriend asked me for slides he wears them all the time he is very content

These are one of the few slides that fit my feet properly I have a wide foot and most sandals just feel weird but not these I wear them all the time and fit me with socks on too Perfect for any occasion

Best slide ever made I purchase annually just to refresh them

My 3rd pair this summer Wish the gold was in stock

Love support but should be sewed instead of glued

Love product just wish they were made better like they used to be My strap already shows signs off detaching on both shoes

They are great quality and fit Perfect to wear anywhere

I loved these on the website but when I got them they run really big and are kind of cheap in quality

Get tts soooo goood so these are durable confortable and if you live an active lifestyle you will be glad to know you can hose them off and be good as new 10 outta 10

I got the same size as from high school and they fit me exactly the same

Ordered another pair had to send back the size 7 because it fits like a size 8 or larger

Needed a new pair of sandals so I decide to go try these out Enjoying The feel and considering buying another pair

The quality and the feel and most of all they are very unique and very comfortable like it

had these for 20 years just bought another pair

it is stylish and neat need more colours though as The women

I got a half size bigger the length of the fit is good but the width and fit are so tight I wore the sandals for one day and could not walk the next day I had 2 blisters on each foot from the sides being so tight strapped around my foot

A size 6 was too small will need to return and get a bigger size

I like the product because not only is it nice but comfortable also

I love the color and design of them but wish they had larger sizes when I went to order

Will return and try a size 4 probably

Purchased these for my 15yr old son He loves them They run a little big but look great and good quality Very happy with this purchase

Consistent product like the fit and finish would definitely order again

Adidas is an awesome brand Good quality products and comfortable fit

I had blisters the first time when I wore this pair Terrible slides Not comfortable not recommended

The color is unique and perfect My favorite type of slides

I love the color I wish they would have worked out Bummer

I have been buying Adilette slides for several years because they are comfortable colorful and keep my feet cool in the Summer

I like that it does not look feel cheaply made like other slides it is very comfortable

Very cute and stylish do not wear for too long those It started to hurt the arch of my foot but I recommend trying on in the store

The sizing is true to size Some of the reviews said to order a size up and I did in which I had to exchange them for my size which is a 9 I like the white ones because no everyone has this color They stay on my foot well and rinse off well I wear them to volleyball or running errands etc

So stylish and comfortable I wear a size 8 5 in womenso I ordered a 7 menand they fit perfect LOVE THESE

Loved it Very comfortable at all times and would buy again

I had to order in men because they did not have my size in women I am very pleased They are comfy and look cute on my foot

They are the best slide I know Thanks Adidas

it is a slide It does what slides do Color is dope though

Feels great without socks on Not as soft as Adilette Cloudfoam Plus but still very comfortable

These slides last forever Great product Super DOPE

I love the sandals they are the most comfortable practical sandals of ever owned I have been buying the same as now for at least 13 years But as I have been writing most of your clothing companies it would be nice if you would offer half sizes throughout all of your sizes and perhaps start a new service where people can send in their measurements and you will make clothes special in charge of premium a lot of people Pay it and I would and please offer your shoes where you offered to build your own in a large margin size Pay it and I word and please offer your shoes where you offered to build your own in larger sizes

Convenient comfy casual love them can not wait to wear them

Great product fits great and very comfortable I recommend to everyone

Product quality and fit was perfect Web site easy to use and delivery ws fast Would recommend

Was given a pair of blue and white adilette slides in 1991 Wore them consistently as my comfy shoes for the last 27 years The strap on one of the slides finally pulled away from the footbed today Need to go find another pair Great slides and I would highly recommend them to anyone

True to size and extremely comfortable Highly recommend for anyone in the slide market Blows the Jordans out of the water

they look very good and are perfect for this summer

Original design but more bold gets me hyped up let us go

They fit great and are very comfy I also love how versatile they are you can make so many outfit combos with these sandals

Decided to get a newer pair for the next decade I have had a pair of these slides since 04 and although the actual stripes have come loose overtime which is probably expected from wear and getting them wet this overall is a A buy I have had Nike slides throughout the years but none has come close to lasting as long as these

I like these and how that with wear the band is less stiff

The classic Adidas slide in new colorssomething for everyone I love them

it is ok needs more cushion to each step and strap of sandals Chafes too much Not really good for the beach

comfy and they go with anything you wear the white gets scuffed up pretty quickly though

I got the shoes for my boyfriend and he loves them and says he wears them all the time They fit perfect

Ordering online was difficult wish they had half sizes but they run pretty small go a size up

2nd purchase to replace my original pair that I have had for 4yrs

Love the color and I have always been a big fan of adidas slides

Love Love Love Absolutely love them The size guide is SPOT on

Love it so much best show slide that I have had 12 10 would recommend to anyone

I had a pair of these that I have worn every summer for the last 20 or so years They were still In good shape but my new puppy got a hold of them I bought a new pair The material on the inside of the slide is slightly different but still just as comfortable Hoping they hold up as well as the old ones

I was skeptical about these because people were saying they ran small but I bought my regular size and they fit perfect Very stylish and very comfortable

They are comfortable and supportive sandals and they look good

The classic slides you have been looking for are these right righ here and with different colors to fit your style

I love these slides This is my 4th pair These are my go to slides they are comfy and I can literally wear them anywhere

This product is great to me The color of them is so vibrant and they are super are comfy

I have several pairs and they have all lasted me for years love them

I really like them but like most of the other reviews say make sure to order a size larger than you typically would Good quality feels soft but at the same time it is ridged enough to not change too much over time

As I said this is my 8th pair of Adilette Style and comfort all in one

Because it is so cool and comfortable The color it is amazing

They are so comfy I was only looking for something to slip on when taking the dog out for a walk but I swear I wear it everywhere now

I buy this sandal every time my previous pair starts showing signs of wear I have tried the cheaper version of the Adidas slide but Adilette is the way to go Spend the extra money especially if you have any foot issues This is almost orthopedic to my feet which have been wrecked from years of roller derby serving and just normal human existence I just ordered a new paid but I might go buy another pair right now just as back up I have added a pic so you can see how cool they look with socks

it is such good quality and very comfortable Very worth it

Adilettes are always the best choice for slides

Love it very comfortable Definitely recommend

The texture and feel of these are very luxurious and great quality Adidas exceeded my expectations

very comfortable wish they came in 1 2 sizes that would fit better overall fit is ok and look is great

Kinda bummed The reviews said these run small but I would definitely say the opposite I am usually a 7 5 but there are no half sizes so after reading the reviews I went with an 8 and they are too big wore them once already so I can not return

Very nice slides nice color I would buy this again

Comfort and durability Keeps my back in alignment Wish they came in solid colors like all black

I like this shoe and I would recommend this shoe to others

It was a great gift You need to order a size up and the name engravement can hardly be seen it is the same color as the main sole of the slide and is very small st and ed in Plus all of the colors are a little bit lighter that what they appear to be online Over all they are comfortable and good quality if you do not mind not seeing the name I would recommend them but just be aware that the shades of the colors is a little off and the name could hardly be seen

Bring back the white lining underneath the strap

it is a very comfortable shoe It goes with pretty much anything you wear

I was so excited to get my first pair of slides so i decided to make them unique and customize my own They have a black base with a white band and blue stripes Unfortunately after just a week the slides started to bleed the blue onto the sides of the slides I am bummed because it is really noticeable and I am unsuccessful in cleaning them

perfect slide for anytime day or night favorite go to when in a hurry

They are a perfect fit and they look really good omg I love them and I even recommended them to my friend who loved them too

When the product came it had a terrible odor that I thought would go away after a few dayshowever the odor lasted a while so I returned the product

Always wanted to get a pair but never new my size but am happy that I purchase them love the color

Its very comfortable and lightweight I really do recommend this product

The slides are extremely comfortable and provide my feet the support that other shoes lack

The worst shoes I have ever purchased and extremely upset

it is original and i like it very much and it is my favorite sandal

I just wish the slides were wider I bought a half size up and they are still too narrow

Even though I have big feet these snug fitting slides fit well

Great product great gift My boyfroliend loved them ty

I bought it for my son and I would like to exchange it because of size The rest is perfect the design the color etc

First off the sizes are a whole size too small I normally wear a W8 M6 but for some reason the size I normally wear was too small I had to get the next size up There also seems to be no cushion or support on these slides I had a pair of slides from a different brand and those had way more comfort and support

Great slides Super easy transaction great price great shoes

it is sturdy comfortable and stylish It looks like it would last too Highly recommend it

I bought these slides almost a year ago and they were perfect Unfortunately someone else stretched them out so I bought a 2nd pair When they arrived they looked amazing but after I wore them I noticed the quality was not as good as the pair I previously purchased Also the newest pair I bought seemed to be much larger in the width of the strap that goes over your foot I love these slides and have been wearing them since I was a kid but this pair was disappointing in its quality

Once you break them in they are super comfortable Fit was true to size

I like it cause it is cute But there is like NO comfort

Way to narrow and hard I do not feel confatable at all when wearing them

Perfect slides and not too big true to size Besides they are super comfortable

I had to return the purchase because it felt like I was walking on concrete barefoot

contours feel good width seems pretty accurate These slides seem to not stay straight on my feet These are better than the last pair I had though

Very comfortable fit and perfect size Definitely recommend

Congratulations

Quality is great and these slides are perfect for wearing around the house or at the gym

quality product and will keep buying have them for years and still worth it

I started wearing these sandals 30 years ago when I played soccer They were comfortable easy on off and looked good I tried numerous other sandals over the years and was never truly happy with them Recently I needed a new pair of sandals I immediately thought of my old Adidas Adilette Slides Like most great things in the past I did not think I would be able to get the exact same model I was completely surprised when I saw my old go tostill available Nothing had changed except they are now available in blue and black I cannot tell you just how happy I was to see these It was the quickest purchase I have made They arrived as described and as I remembered and before they were estimated I opened the box and put on right away My feet were happy and I was ecstatic If you need some sandals for any purpose I highly recommend these They might be a little more expensive compared to some sandals but they are built to last And can you really put a price on Happy FeetI do not think so Give them a try You will not be disappointed

Comfortable with any clothes Overall great purchase

Easy slide on when on the go and the best of all they look good

Might be worst adidas product I ever bought I love Supernova running shoes These slides are garbage

Comfortable great fit very satisfied Always a great product

Only one could order in my sonsize but needed to be adjustable around foot too wide

I have owned dozens of Adilette slide over the years but with experiencing the cloudfoam footbed it only makes sense to have the cloudfoam footbed with Single bandage PU coated synthetic upper Make it happen

I owed a pair years ago and they eventually gave I due to the water and tear So I immediately ordered another pair and I am back at it

The length of these is fine but the strap is over my fight is too tight I even went up one size but even though the slide was bigger the strap over is still as tight and uncomfortable

When I first owned these slides they hurt my feet pretty bad The entire slide was incredibly stuff and took a few months to finally break in However once I finally broke these puppies in they became my go to shoe for casual wear and around the house They are very comfortable and have molded to my feet It was worth the few months of pain to break them in I am thinking about retiring these pair I currently own because it is going on two years now They still are in fair condition but I just want to get a newer pair Such a timeless classic slide A great buy

This product is straight cash 10 10 recommended buy Worth the money by far I have had these for a week and wear them everywhere Insanely comfortable and stylish

I love these sandals because they are so comfortable and they are so well made

Soooooooooooo comfortable Love the color as well

Matched my high expectations and delighted my son

Adidas makes the best product of all time I have been a customer for over 40 years Still the best quality best styles best fit totally awesome

I love these because they are so easy and can wear with anything Can be tough to break in around the tow area but I LOVE THEM

Iconic and versatile 3 stripe slides I wear daily

Love it Lightweight comfortable and convenient However sometimes it does feel like my foot is sliding in it

my last pair of slides lasted 10 years i finally wore through the sole and needed a new pair they fit the same feel the same look the same hopefully i will get another 10 years

They are lightweight durable and easy to clean Satisfied

They are not the slides they used to be Not nearly as comfortable and the quality is very poor

I like the style because it is simple I do not like how uncomfortable it is

These are the perfect slides A size 8 has never fit my foot so perfectly as these

Are very confortable Pretty and useful for lots of things I love to use them while traveling

Great arch support great all day easy on and off

Super comfortable and stylish I own like 5 pairs now

COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT COOL AND CHEAP MUST HAVE

Great product

very comfortable last long price is good will recommend tofriends

Great summer staple If you are ordering for a woman be sure to size down to the smaller full size

These were just too wide and so hard to keep them on

I believe the product was misrepresented They are very hard to wear they are still too big and the plastic cuts into the toes I basically cannot wear them

love these slides I literally wear them with everything

I normally wear a 7 5 8 in womenI ordered a 7 in Mens they fit PERFECTLY literally my foot fits perfectly in the slide I ordered the red ones they are cute and comfortable

Way too narrow for my feet went from a 10 to 11 and it did not really help

very comfortable on the foot and easy to wear everyday

Awesomeness slides They are a bit roomy for my foot but I know adidas fits me like that

Easy to wear Cannot make it any simpler Opinion have to glue the white strips

Amazing slides I wear these slides instead of shoes now as they are super comfortable

I am usually a narrow 8 5 woman and the mensize 7 fit perfectly Very comfy and more stylish than my flip flops

Comfy everyday sandal that I can slide on a go and still look good

Does not feel comfortable and makes my feet sweat

I have had SEVERAL pairs of these slides in the past Not sure why they changed as they are an Adidas staple but they are now very plastic and much larger than in the past

These are the original slide many might copy it but nothing will match the a adilette Functional comfortable and stylish at the same time

it is super cute and comfortable and stylish My only issue is that my feet go inward because my feet do not reach the top of the sandal The width and the length are perfect just not the height

Very nice and comfortable I will definitely recommend this for anybody

These look exactly like the classics I bought 15 years ago but did not feel like them at all The material is not as sturdy as my old ones I was trying to replace but still cute

They are simple yet classy I wear a size 7 in mensize 9 in womenbut I had to get an 8 in these They fit fine though The price was great and they are very comfortable

Purchase for my teenage son wish I had gotten me a pair great slides

These are mensized shoes obviously Though they say it will work for a woman to just size down I must warn against that My feet are what I would consider a pretty normal width for a womanfeet and these sandals are just way too wide I am a pretty true size 8W and a men7 was a fine length but the strap and sole were lose and did not hold my foot in at all I am super disappointed because I love the classic style of these sandals

Good quality they fit true to size and very durable

I gave these 4 stars only because these run small and I had to return for a bigger size I am a size 7 in womenso I ordered a 5 because these run in mensizes only The size 5 way too small and I had to order a 6 The 6 is perfect but it was a hassle that I was not aware that they ran small I was not able to take them on my trip to Orlando Bummer Otherwise these are the most comfortable slides ever LOVE

a tad narrow for wide feet could be a bit bigger too

I did not like the womenversion of these shoes so I got these in a size 7 women8 5 and they fit perfect and are way better than the new slides they are making for women There were a lot of reviews that said the sizing was off but I found I was exactly what I usually am

This new cheaply made Adilette is an utter disgrace No more arch support no more comfortable strap and no more thick cushion of material between you and the floor BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL

The female sizing conversion is a bit off I wear a female 8 and the male size 6 fits best These are my favorite slippers for wearing around the house because I can wear with or without socks I have plantar fasciitis and there is good arch support which helps ease my foot pain

I would recommend one size up I ordered a size 6 because I am normally a size 6 in men but had to return and get a 7

The shoe is poorly made and the white lining is horrible

This is an athletic rubber shoe I use it for style as well as after workouts Why would you line the upper portion of the shoe with that cheesey white lining that not only shows from the outside put will inevitably get dirty and grungy with normal wear

Did it fit well too narrow too short I do not recommend

These are absolutely beautiful The quality is superb my only issue is the strap is WAY too big my feet slide around like crazy Other than that they are perfect I am hoping I can find out if there is a way to order another pair with a tighter strap I would gladly order them in every color material combination

Very comfy I can not take it off I can wear these all day without hurting my feet

based off the other reviews i had higher expectations for these to be comfortable They are not what i expected but i guess that is the quality you pay for Still stylish though

So comfy exactly what i expected perfect slides for around the house and for running errands

I ordered before and like it I would like a size 7 in black but can not find it no where

These are the best slides I have ever owned So cozy

They are so comfortable to walk around it BUT I bought the all white ones and was wondering as to how I can clean them

Very comfortable I wear them around the house for comfort LOVE them Most comfortable slides ever Works with socks or without

I love these slides they are great and comfortable

I ordered this slide thinking it would be like the slide I bought years ago It is advertised as the original My old slides have a cottonee material in the inside of the slide top This slide has none It is not as comfortable

I still have my old pair of these sandals my 3rd pair actually since the 90and a brand new pair thats very different that I am trying to get used to The old version is softer has more support and has white cotton material underneath the strap The old version is far superior I keep trying to transition to my new pair but keep going back to my old ratty pair Once my old pair bites the dust I will be shopping for a new sandal as this new version Adidas has put out has zero merit except for the classic look and that is not enough to overcome the lack of comfort this new version has This is someone elsereview I feel the same Pl bring back the old quality Feet hurt with this new kind

Adilette slides are great in comfort and minimal aesthetic

Love these Have worn them for several years now however when you first start wearing them you can get blisters around your toes so the material has to be worn in for a week or so

These are very good shoes But I bought some a few years ago and those were way better quality than these Feel like they got a little cheaper

Maybe my 3rd or fourth pair over the last twenty years Great quality great comfort Cannot imagine life without them

I purchased custom slides I love the soft suede and puny hair however the band that goes onto of the foot needs to be smaller to fit a womanfoot or more padded to prevent slipping and uncomfortable walking If I were able to I would return them since it is not practical to walk in I would like to order more but will probably be a full size down

Not like the old onesMine still have made in Italy on them I ordered these for my boyfriend and was disappointed They are flimsy and thinNOT LIKE THE OLD ONES BRING BACK THE QUALITY ADIDAS

I have 3 other pairs of your slides older models While the quality seems the same the band is a little tighter Maybe it will loosen with wear but I do not remember my other ones being this tight

I love this design and it very comfortable But it much wide for me

Perfect slip on after long run and after a hot yoga

Great slide Thank you So comfortable and fit true

This is the second pair last one worn out very satisfied

Not the same quality as my previous adilettes Dissappointed that they feel cheap

Best looking and feeling slides out there I wear them wherever I go

They are a little heavy and there is no way to adjust the size or the way they fit your feet

comfort and quality does not compare to the ones you made in Italy

I bought 2 pair 6 years ago I was having a hard time finding these I found them online they are the same quality and fit the same they last as long as amazing after 5 years and started falling apart I was gluing them together they fit perfect and all form fitted by the balls of your feet very comfortable highly recommend them to everybody both men and women my daughter also has many pairs

good good very very good i like that thank you adidas

The shoe fits slightly small on me somce they do not have 7 5 sizes only full 7 The upper band starts cutting my toes after a while so my other solution is to wear socks but I would rather not because they look great without them They are comfortable for a couple of hours

I really love these slides I wear them with my active wear and with summer dresses They were a little uncomfortable at first but after a few wears they form to your feet

I have been a lifelong Jordan Nike customer but after three pairs of Jordan slippers that were uncomfortable after a while I bought these Pretty good decision I would wear these all day if I could

Have been searching for these slides for years after my original pair wore out and finally ordered them on line Perfect slides for the pool and very comfortable

The older models used to have a thicker fabric beneath the foot strap that prevented any rubbing irritation but the news ones fail to have this cushioning I guess the old adage of they do not make them like they used to still applies

I am a size 6 5 with more so narrow ish feet These slippers although very cute and comfy run pretty big I found it disappointing they only come in full sizes 4 5 6 etc and no half sizes I went with a size 7 because of what other wrote in their reviews running too small etc and I had to return them for a 6 which fits well but it is still pretty wide Hope this helps

Well it will not let me Rite on the strap

My mom bought these when she was in high school now I am in high school and they are my go to sandals They have lasted 20something years

what else to say

I love theses ever since my first boyfriend wore them after soccer

Delivery was promptthe slides arrived faster than the estimated delivery date

Came in the mail faster than expected with cool hanger to hang in them in the closet they fit jus right and I recommend going true to size good quality and very comfortable

I like this shoes

Do you have white floor tiles in your bathroomMy wife always hinted me and my blue adilettes to be responsible for the dark smudges on the white bathroom floor tiles These adilettes with their white outsole took me out of the line of fire at once

I absolutely LOVE this shoe I have owned the same pair for over 10 years They are just now starting to wear out

aesthetically the slide looks good For the record my foot has always fit well in Adidas sneakers do to the narrow nature of my foot For some reason these slides are rubbing the outside of my pinky toes on both sides so much that my toes almost feel bruised when I put on normal sneakers I am a little disappointed since I have been wanting a pair of these since I was a kid now 35

I love these slides not only are they convenient to wear but they are stylish and go with just about anything

My last pair of adidas slides lasted for 20 years of wear These adidas slides fit well and can be worn with or without socks which is a plus after ball games or a golf match LOVE THEM

The customer service representative was kind to replace some broken sandals with these They are exceptionally comfortable and they look great

I bought a pair of the same size to replace my old pair that were the most comfortable I have owned There were several changes in strap design I noted The embossing and the type of fabric When I put them on the straps cut into the tops of my toes so they were unwearable Incredibly disappointed

Best Slides Ever

You can not go wrong with the Adilette Classic and bright colors makes these a must

I love these and I have several pairs of them in several colors Easy shoes for walking around the house outside on a dirty hotel floor or whatever

I ordered these looking for a comfortable and easy going shoe I am a true size 6 ordered them in 6 and they appear to be a half size too big Of course there is not half size options Also the strap is sharp and I know with reoccurring wear and use that I will get blisters Returning these unfortunately

I just bought these sandals and they are too wide and do not look like the picture The inside of the strap is black but in the picture it is gray The reason I wanted these sandals was because my sister has a pair which are from a while ago then I got the shoes in the mail and was disappointed to see that they changed the sandals and they now are made from a cheap material and are slightly uncomfortable

Most of people like it

The most comfortable flip flops you could own The fit my feet perfectly and are incredibly sturdy In fact I still own the very first pair I ever bought I have had them for 18 years

These are great for around the house and yard

I have owned many pairs of Adidas sandals and these are the worst Horribly uncomfortable and developed calluses on the inside of my big toe only after one day of wearing This sizing was correct it was just a very rigid sandal Must try on prior to buying

I love these slides and have had multiple pair When my last pair wore out I order a new pair like always But you changed them They used to have a nice soft inner lining portion of the upper strap Now it is rigid and feels cheap I am sure there is a reason for the change but it is not a good change Please bring the old version back

Fan of Adidas but I was not too impressed with the way the colors were displayed Not what I expected

My boyfriend wanted these so bad but when we received it the color was more of a bright red In the picture it was more like a dark red and that is why he wanted it

Unique use of rainbow colors to spread across both shoes

These are great and so comfortable iIm a woman so i found them a bit wide but for a man i bet they would be perfect

These slides are super cute and very BRIGHT I love them They are the plastic kind so they take a little time to break in and I could not wear them for long periods in the beginning until they were worn in due to blisters

Pick up the red and the black ones could not find it anywhere in store so had to order them

I love my sandals Classic look never fails

First time I purchased these slides from Adidas and I love it Would recommend for everyone

I do suggest knowing your shoe size prior to ordering I ordered a pair of custom shoes probably two years ago now and I ordered them in my normal size I was told only after the fact they all sizing is in mens I have a pair of gray pink that I purchased in womenSo now I have a pair of sandals I really can not wear because they are too big

I have several pair and was excited to add these to my collection

Had a pair of black ones til they wore out I am glad decided to go with red this time

The ordering size down from your women size the site recommends you to do is just right it is exactly what I was expecting and I cant wait to customize some personal ones for myself I am very happy and in love

if you wear these slides the strap is just about the most uncomfortable it gets i highly recommend if you get these to only wear them for short periods of time and unless they have changed the straps since them a year ago you cannot wear these without getting enormous blisters on the tops of your toes until it is practically impossible to walk even without them on because the cut into the tops of your toes so badly

These slippers are pretty cool They are comfy and good for travel I wear a size 10 so that is the size I got in womenbut they are a little big I should gotten either a 9 or 9 5 I will not return them because they are not that dramatically big but I love them

I have a pair of white ones and a pair of blue they fit perfect and width is more narrow But the ones I just purchase fit perfect but the width is a lil to wide for my foot

I was sure that the shoes I ordered were for women it happened that were for man They were too wide for me even when I looked on the label it says it is for women They do not have good description instead of women it says original what kind of description is thatI had to return them

I ordered again size 7 this time and they are much better A perfect fit in the length and strap with socks

Bought my man a pair Size 12 He loves them Wanted them for me did not have my sizeSize5 Until today I have my own now Happy woman Love Adidas

Thes slides are great They are so comfortable These are my first pair and I will defintely buy more I lvoe the red color I chose

I bought these for my son he absolutely loves them The very first time he put them on he smiled and said how comfortable they were light flexible and hugged his feet giving him the support he needs he is still growing so I definitely know what to get him next winter Thank you Nike

Awesome Sneaker Super lightweight but supportive of both ankle and foot They need no breaking in and they fit truly to size Snug but not too tight The soles live up to their namethey truly grip the ground Great job Nike

MAKE SOME OF YOUR MODELS IN WIDE WIDTH NIKE

These shoes are definitely underrated and ignored and they should be advertised more

I bought the olive color way These shoes are so very comfortable and look great feel great and look like they will last a long long time The traction is very good and the elastic sock has a zipper and laces to tie which makes the shoe very snug Break in was 1 2 days but really felt like it did not need to be broke in just took out the box and put them on and away I went not even feeling like I had new shoes on felt good right off the bat I just bought 2 pair of Air Force 1and returned them because of the new strap system no shoe laces but so glad that I got these try them on and you too should be pleasently surprised

This shoe is amazing Extremely comfortable with a very thick cushioned sole waterproof and looks great on feet Got the triple black color way and even in Minnesota the snow salt can not touch these Most durable shoe I have ever worn

Just pick these up in the tan colorway and am really digging them They have a great foot presence and look nice with jeans and taper khakis Will wear to work as they have a definite boot look as opposed to sneakers Love that versatility Only thing is zipper is kind of hard to zip up when shoe is on I have not really worn them in yet so expect that to change I am a nut for mid high sneaker boot sobthe Gripps really make the grade Very spiffy

As someone who for years could not imagine my real world footwear needs without the all black Air Huarache Utility lows as a heavy favorite 95 of the time daily urban to multi hour hikes across dead volcano craters my only request was ever if these were mids or even highs they would be perfect Fast forward to now to reading about this new Gripp model So I of course ordered the all blacks immediately anticipating what I could only imagine would definitely be my dream go to sneaker But I am intensely sad to report that these are not nearly as comfortable the cushioning on the forefoot is either missing or the designers thought it needed to be this hard for some unknown reason Also the forefoot upper is too intrinsically stiff and instead of flexing with your foot just kind of well does not It ripples and then rubs into your foot Which could maybe be easily fixed if there was not as much of the upper material on this movement zone Regardless the look was 100 on point even though the laces add essentially nothing the bootie zip up closure are plenty but the fit and comfort especially given the Air Huarache lineage was truly disappointing Returned in less than one month for refund Years of waiting ruined

These sneakers were comfortable when I had them in 1993 and they are just like I remembered them Love the colorway which works with a few of the pastel colors that I wear from time to time

I would recommend these to any serious basketball player for comfort support and great style Also Finish Line has shoe availability when most other sell out

The shoe and colorway is great The ankle part makes me want to get a full refund Scrapes against ankle on every movemnt

I bought these for my son and he absolutely loves them

I never had a pair of retro 8s until the needs came out The first day I saw the color I immediately bought it when it came I was not used to the foot sleeve that it has inside but over time I got used to it the shoe is really comfortable and has became one of my favorite retros

Shoes are what you make of them so when you buy Jordanenjoy them and do not complain or stop buying them

The original shoes was one of my favorites When I saw these coming out in grey I thought they were straight The black got my attention and took me back to middle school so I got them

This might of been the last pair of JordanI order The quality I expect from a 190 pair of shoes was definitely not there From the exposed and excess glue on the seams too the scuffed up suede The quality of the Jordan brand has really gone downhill in the last few years

Got for my son freshman in Hhe loves The grey is the perfect Gray Goes with everything

Very comfortable and super fressshhh Very impressed

I got one size bigger which felt very comfortable If I got my normal size 9 then the shoe would have been to small I love this shoe because it hays some padding inside but not to much that makes it tight or to small it is a just right amount of padding which make the shoe extra comfortable

One of my better buys Great graphics Perfect colorful layout Just a fantastic shoe

Great product at a great price Love the look and style of the Air Jordan Retro 8

I love the colorway of this shoe and it fits true to size

Classic Cool Grey all day Beautiful design and my absolute favorite shoes to ball in I like my shoes as tight as possible so the VIIIare perfectly designed for that Nike Jordan never fails when it comes to comfort This is the shoe to own

First Jordan 8and I am very happy Great quality love the suede nubuck Very happy with my purchase Glad they kept the shoe all grey love the monotone

I never excepted this much from an 8 i hated the 8s till these came out

So i have been on a kick buying Jordans and despite my better judgement I ordered these The quality is fantastic and the finish overall feels durable I am just not sure I can ever get behind the look of these shoes Maybe with time they will grow on me but despite being comfortable in most areas these just are not my favorites Ankle cushioning feels like a little much to me as well

Very comfortable difficult to crease good traction retains a lot of energy in your step Also my first retro and Im quite glad

Great looking shoe in person I love the colorway and made out of quality material A must have if you are a true Jordan fan The Jordan VIII is my favorite of the Jordan brand number shoe

amazingly comfortable and it matches so many things

These are the coolest pair of shoes I have ever owned they are comfy and look great i almost got retro 4s instead Im very happy I didnt they do not crease and scuffs come out very easily look way better in person highly recommend

The cushioning is extremely shock absorbent and for all of you sneaker heads VERY hard to crease They match anything and draw a lot of attention Be warned they scuff very easily because of the suede leather BUT it comes right out with a d and washcloth I freaked out over the scuffmarks I obtained during the day but they literally disappeared with just a little wipe AMAZING

They are great They fit comfortably I had them when I was a boy and they are my favorite of the retro Air Jordan brand

We are definitely a Nike family These Air Jordan Retro 8s are top knotch They are so nice and worth the money It was great to surprise my husband for Christmas The quality is awesome the fit and comfort are superb

This is a great product I love it great product I would recommend the shoe to anyone

I really love the original colorways of Jordanthat are not always Bulls colors These are one of the most comfortable pairs of retros I own and the 90s colors are on point I am a big fan of the straps and chenille Jumpman logo on the tongue

Classic style and color The Jordan Enterprise never fails to be excellent

This is a really nice shoe looks good on the colors are great

got them on release and easily the most comfortable shoe i have had good materials love the suede overall a great shoe for casual wear

Way before I fell in love with basketball or picked up my first Busta Rhymes CD I offered a friend of mine a pair of brand new snazzy LA Techwith LED lights in the heel for a pair of these As worn down as his Jordanwere he still turned my offer down I was nine at the time

The 2015 aqua XIIIs exceed my expectations The leather is excellent the Grey durabuck heel color is much better looking in hand than in the pictures Some buy hype I buy heat Thank you Nike and JB for making these available for the holidays Christmas Thanksgiving

Bought the Aqua 8on release day and they are easily the most comfortable JordanI have ever worn Padding on the inside is soft and cushioned and the material used on the shoe holds up Mild glue stains on the shoe but nothing too big I had to go a half size down to size 8 5 from my usual size 9 Would recommend this product to anyone

The first pair I bought was the Bred colorway Next was the Orange Purple and Grey colorway Thus purchase was the Aqua colorway All great shoes Fit snug You could really play ball in them if you wanted or just accent a wardrobe I like to thank Nike and the Jordan Brand for going back to quality You notice the difference on the shoes that released this year

I am very happy with the product Nike com gave me

Great and comfortable shoe I got a pair a long time ago when i was a kid Great shoe might have to get it a size too big though

Comfortable but i had to go a half size big do to the cut

However they are just as hot as I remember

When buying this shoe I was a bit skeptical at the design but in person the shoe looks awesome There are only a few quality flaws such as fraying and some very minor glue issues Great shoe overall but also a bit heavy

I can say that the quality has improved a little with the suede as well as production I did have to swith out one shoe for another due to the jordan paper leaving an in print on the shoe Satisfied wit my recent purchase

theses shoes are super comfy high top 4 gr8 ankle support if you get these get ur dunk size

this jordan is hotttttttttttttt i had to get it i never had the 8 and it came on here i had to get it i got it and luvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv it

I like these because they are super clean These 8feature reflective 3m material on the back which is important when choosing an Air Jordan 8 due to keeping the back clean because of the materials used on the other 8countdown pack especially If you want a always fresh and clean pair of 8this is the way to go if you like fresh whites they will bling bling in the sun These are very comfy and the straps help for superior support but I think most people will rock these instead of hooping because I just like to be fresh in whatever JI throw on

Feel graet also colors are cool

Nice looking shoes Only thing i do not like is the attached tongue You can not adjust or loosen the laces Very tight fit

I bought the Kyrie 5s for my son and daughter We love the style and they are very comfortable My daughter wants to wear hers everyday My son uses them for basketball he says they are some of the best he has ever used on the court

The Kyrie 5s are just like the 4s but better in terms of style durability and support The wider midsole makes it difficult to turn your ankle By removing Cushlon there is not much cushioning overall especially in the heel Also they are incredibly difficult to get on due to the new Flytrap

I will say that the shoes are good looking I ordered these and within days the upper edge by my ankle started to tear up Another downside is that it seems they went for the looks over the comfort I have used these for three days now and the back is cutting and bruising my ankle in the back I wear NBA Air Jordan basketball socks with very much padding Over all they have a good design but terrible comfort

Brought the same size I usually wear but it is tough to get in but overall it is comfortable and feels great

I have been wearing Kyrie shoes for a while my favorite of which being the Kyrie 2s I bought this shoe because of the relatively cheap price tag and the expectation of an improved version of the Kyrie 2 but was immediately let down To start off with the shoes are very heavy not comfortable and do not get used to your feet For guards and posts alike they feel clunky and slow Compared to the Kyrie 2 which feels like it wraps around your foot this shoe felt like a cheap failure and more like the first edition of a shoe not the fourth However what is easily the biggest problem of all is the traction Even right after being wiped the traction on this shoe is sub par and it loses that fresh feeling after only a few seconds when you find yourself finding the need to wipe your shoes again I find these almost unplayable and urge anyone looking to buy these to reconsider

I just received my Kyrie 5 BHM last night and I have got to say that I was really worried after reading all the reviews that the shoe would not fit or be too tight

I love the shoes but could not get them on When I did the width was super tight I have worn Nike in size 11 for the past 20 years and have never had a pair fit like this Super disappointed Shoe runs VERY small Very uncomfortable and hard in my opinion I will not buy Kyrieagain

The 5s have pretty good lock down and cushioning but the traction is kinda bad which is not what I expect from a kyrie shoe

One of the best Kyrie models to date Hands down And I loved the Kyrie 4 A must have from a styling standpoint or on court performance I have the Taco and Just Do It editions If you are older and your feet have widened a bit then get 1 size up The shroud over the bridge of the foot is fixed and not adjustable as it appears It WILL put pressure on the bridge of your foot if you are someone whofoot has widened a bit If it were flexible or stretchable the even people with wider feet would be able to wear their true size

I love the Kyrie line I have had every shoe in this line including the fly traps that Nike does not sell

These shoes were THE thing my son wanted for Christmas this year He is 12 years old 5 5 100very fit NOT a big kid He was so super excited to get this box on Christmas morning and immediately super disappointed when he could not even get his foot in the shoe The plastic plate that covers the laces restrict the shoe from opening wide enough for his foot to go in I have a very narrow foot and I could barely force my foot in these shoes Thanks for ruining Christmas with a ridiculous design

The shoe is nice it is increadibly light and has great cushion The insole is memory foam ish like the ADs Shoe does run tight Most kyries do If you have wide feet Not a shoe for you Overall they are worth the money

I used to wear Air Max infuriate 2but I got some Kyrie 5s and they are great They are so comfortable and in my old shoes my feet where sore after every game but with these they were amazing My feet felt great

Great shoe look and feel are both excellent Really high quality and durable so far I where a size 13 and my shoes were spot on They seem like they would be tight putting them on but once my foot slid into them they were amazing They do not run too small as a previous review states You should be fine with your normal size

The shoes look great but putting them on is like putting on snowboarding boots The mesh layer that covers the top is stiff and I actually had to undo the string on the side that holds the lace to get my foot into the shoe This requires way too much effort and the shoe felt too snug so I am returning them and will try the PGs

Shoe runs VERY small I wear an 11 5 in all Nike and Jordan I have tried prior to this these are too small in length and width is very tight as well Very umcomfortable and hard in my opinion I will not buy Kyrieagain

Classic shoes but the materials were sub par Recommend going half size up since they run small like most runners Excellent variety of colorways

Just a good product it feels comfy good support and bottom sole is nice and strong Very stylish as well can go with any good pair of black or blue jeans

Good for basketball its so light the only issue is it does not have a lace and cannot tight it well

FAVORITE NUMBER JORDAN PERFECT FIT WITH ZIPPER A LITTLE STIFF BUT FEEL FINE AFTER THEY ARE BROKEN IN

I loved the design of these and this was a great purchase

As good as expected and nothing to complain about

Perfect shoes for me Its comfortable and i love the style

I grew up wearing Stan Smithand I LOVE them I am usually a Women6 5 7 As far as sizing the first pair I ordered was a Womensize 7 They arrive before they said they would but unfortunately they were way way too big I remembered that I used to by youths I returned the sneakers which was easy and completely hassle free The only small note is that I could not change size from a womento a youths online for an exchange Not a big deal I simply placed a new order for a youth size 5 5 They fit great and were 10 less I would have bought them if they were 10 more The second pair arrived super fast So happy with Adidas Well done and thank you for still making the original Stan Smithmy favorite sneaks of all time A classic

I played 4 wall wood floor handball for over 40 years and I found that the Stan Smith sole held the floor better than anything else I tried I was sad when you discontinued them but I am very glad you brought them back

Cr and s my toes and is painful Next size larger is way too big everywhere else

Fit in great with any number of looks Wore these with skinny jeans linen sport coat and blackshirt in Paris Verdict from a ParisianParfait 

Super cool classic sneakers Look amazing with different variety of clothes

it is easy going very simple and really nice love the navy color

been wearing Stans forever Very durable great fit Classic all round

I owned my first pair of Stan Smiths in the 70 and have wanted to get a new pair for a while definitely worth the wait and was not disappointed just as I remembered them very comfortable and stylish When I first got them I was playing a lot of tennis and now I am just wearing them for looks but who knows I may get back in the court with them soon

My Dad wore these shoes his entire life He recently died and I was thinking about how for 50 years I never saw my dad wear any sneaker tennis shoe but the Green Stan Smiths I did not even know that what they were called I just called them DadAdidasSadly towards the end of his life he had to cut holes in the sides to out of the sides because his arches fell Still he loved your shoes till the day he died and it gave me great memories Thanks for that

Stan smith are classic and the red is really nice The shoe fits well but the overall quality is not great The material creases immediately and it looks really cheap Pretty much on par for what I expected

Far from true to size a mission to return now

I am sorry to ever say anything negative but I always wear a size 7 that I ordered and after I took off the Tags I noticed how Large they were I think they were Mis Sized Thank you

Classic but modern style They definitely stand out

Because it is comfortable versatile and fit in every occasions

I can match this shoe with a lot of clothes And for the price it worth it

Need to go 2 sizes down Overall nice and stylish shoes

Love this shoe Very comfy and goes with all my outfits

Great value great comfort stylish Great value great comfort stylish

Great summertime shoe and casual look with a comfortable fit

I like it because it looks clean and simple at an affordable price

The classic ensures I love the new colors but went with the subtle white with blue trim

Absolutly amazing best quality and it fit perfectly

Beyond comfortable and stylish I love wearing them out

No need to break these guys in fit was perfect from the first time I put them on

The product is great thanks and will find more as time goes by

Classic look Very clean Well designed Love the Stan SmithI have been wearing them since the 80 

I like this because it is very comfortable and nice

it is a great looking classic shoe can not go wrong with Stan Smiths

Great quality such a great fit and they shoes match the images well

Sharp comfortable shoes with sweatpants jeans or khakis Love them

The product feels very comfortable besides the fact that I love the brand

I usually wear a EU 40 in Adidas However the EU 40 in the Stan Smith was a little too large for me so I went down to the EU 39 5 and the fit was much better If you have wide feet I think you will find these shoes to your liking and comfortable Enjoy

leather uppers are stiff compared to my older pairs but still a nice pair of shoes

One can not ask for better

Have ben wearing Stan Smiths for over 45 years and plan to wear them for many years to come

Looks great and goes well with everything It arrived sooner than I expected

I like the shoe because of the good leather on them

Good quality and accurate size These shoes are alittle expensive though

classic white sneaker shoes and comfortable and fit well

Comfortable and stylish Love these shoes have several pairs already

Really like the look of the shoe however they do run a little bigger

The shoes is so cool but you should get a smaller size than what you usually wear

Make this available in WIDE SIZES Improve quality

I love the Stan Smith shoe it is classy and comfortable

Well when I put on they wear hurting my right foot but fit my left ok I put the stretcher to it and they felt better What is hurting me right tors now is they did not see the younger at the very bottom well already worn them my lose

This product produced in China was able to duplicate the original

A sophisticated and stylish shoe for any occasion Made with great quality and comfort

Shoes fit perfect and are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased

Great material Great fit I see why you have kept this shoe exactly how it has always been Thanks Adidas

Standing in them for a long period of time can really start to hurt but other then that after wearing them for a whole week straight they still look clean cans are holding up very well and that is what I think counts

Comfy good looking shoes I love white shoes overall and have had a few adidas

I already had a pair so this will be ready when my old pair wears out

The Stan Smith is one of the best Adidas models of all time so I had to get a pair sooner or later Now that I own them I love them even more they are not the most comfortable shoe but they are not uncomfortable and they just look so good with everything Definitely a purchase I will not regret

Great fit and Classic Style that looks great in many situations

I love this product because it is almost the perfect shoe for me The only thing lacking is that the sole is too thin

Love the Shoes I do not appreciate getting a pair from some store in NY that I thought i was ordering from warehouse that were previously worn I sent them back

Very comfortable shoe Great style for every occasion

Blatantly false advertising by Adidas They want you to believe it is real full grain leather like they used to make them Really nothing more than cheap synthetic leatherette sourced directly from China Big disappointment

I love them Look sharp and comfortable Quality leather

I am 58 years old and I just HATE the current stuff found in stores To me sneakerrs should be mostly white they should be leather and they should look good in an understated way not flashy Stan Smithnever disappoint I can never find them in stores and settle for something else why of why have I not bought WHAT I LIKE onlineI love these classic beauties even my daughters 33 year old boyfriend liked them

The shoe was a perfect fit and very comfortable I took it on a trip and had zero complaints going through the airports site seeing or even going out and about at night

Looks and fits perfectly I especially love they way they look with jeans and chino pants

Great product Have enjoyed for over 30 years

These shoes are super stylish and I live how retro they look

It goes with every outfit that I wear I love these shoes

These shoes are so versatile They can be dressed up or worn casually Love them

These are great shoes so stylish and comfortable

I really like the Rod laver design better then the oneI purchased They are comfortable no very close in design to the Laver shoe

These shoes are comfortable and stylish The all black makes them interchangeable with a lot of outfits

They are stan smiths what are there to say Just love them

I have looked long and hard for comfortable stylish non running shoes These are perfect

These are some nice looking shoes Sizing is a little off A 9 5 is the right length but a little too narrow and a 10 is the right width but a tad too long Other than that I love the shoes

I love the shoes I ordered so comfortable and oerfect size

I have worn Stan Smith sneakers continuously since 1972

Nice shoes I would not play tennis in them but that is not why I got them

love it now will love it always look forward to getting other colors

These shoes are so versatile and go with so many different outfits Make sure you get a half size bigger than what you normally wear however I followed that advice from the reviews and it worked out great

really enjoyed the purchase and will definitely buy another pair

This is at least the 5th time i have purchased these Stan Smith shoes in black It seems Adidas has upgraded the leather on these shoes The material feels softer and smoother The fit is fantastic and there was no break in time needed

Shoes are Way Too big for me to wear on my feet

They look good but need arch support I love these shoes and always have but same issue

These shoes are amazing and go with any outfit It took me a few wears to break them because of their stiffness I would definitely recommend getting half a size smaller than normal as other reviewers have said

liked the navy blue back of shoe

I read to size down 1 2 size so I did and they fit perfectly

I originally owned these as a kid decades ago and these are just as I remembered

Comfortable shoe for a reasonable price reccomend

I have size 16 feet and over the years Adidas has had a few options I loved the Rod Lavers when they were available and now I am loving the Stan Smiths Please keep us bigfooted people in mind when you order your runs Thanks so much

I have been buying this shoe for decades They have always been consistent in quality and comfort

A true classic tennis show with iconic look and feel of the original shoe developed by Stan Smith

These shoes pair perfectly with a casual outfit but can also be dressed up they are super comfortable and I love their look

After switching from the original white with green trim to triple white I have always stayed there I went to buy another pair and there was no triple white to be found Opted for triple black and I am happy with the choice I think I will still get a triple white if it ever becomes available again Aqq

Love the sneakers my favorite for many years still great quality

Was looking for a nice pair of classic white sneakers I was pleased to see these had the ortholite sockliners in them so I decided to go and am very happy They are comfortable and great looking

This shoe is very comfortable and relevant in currentstyles Great shoe

Easy to throw on and goes with everything Perfect for everyday wear

I like them They feel great on my feet I like the green adidas logo

With its simple design and great style this shoe can easily be anyonefavorite This is my third pair of Stan Smiths and I love its affordability and also how it feels on the feet The sneaker is very versatile with a variety of styles and so it adds to my wardrobe Whenever these go I am planning on getting my fourth pair Would highly recommend to those who have not owned a pair before

I love the material is very comfortable and it is good to use every day

Love this version in all black of Stan Smith as it allows me to wear shoes I can do a lot of walking innduring the work day Living and working in Beverly Hills it is a walk around town Stan Smith always garners compliments even from my most fashion forward friends Please continue making these great shoes in all black

Love these shoes They fit great look wonderful and are very comfortable

The quality seems to be excellent However these shoes are simply too narrow Unfortunately the buyer has no option to select a width when purchasing I assume all lengths are the same basic width I exchanged the first pair for a half size larger but they are still the same narrow width I intended to buy the same shoe in white but I have already taken care of that via another brand

I love this shoe so much and I get so many compliments It is very stylish but ORDER A HALF SIZE SMALLER So they fit good mine is just a tad to big

The women sizes were all out so I bought the men size equivalent Shoes were shipped extremely fast no complaints there My girlfriend put them on and said everything was perfect Extremely satisfied with the purchase

I like them so much Thai I never kick them off untying them befor pulling them off my feet I respect the product

Very stylish and good quality shoes They do run large so order 1 2 to one size down

Best all around shoe I have ever owned Fifth pair I have owned

Because it is the most comfortable make i have ever seen

Fit is perfect Great for tennis or everyday wear

Simple without frills Fit is a bit wide There is no removable insole

Great Shoe at a great price with quick delivery

I love Stan Smiths I have slight wide foot so many shoes I have to size up half size or full size I went true to size and do not regret it Although is slightly snug on the sides it does not produce discomfort Length wise is perfect Highly recommend

Jus overall classic shoes Goes with everything and you are going to look fresh without having to try hard

Can wear everyday with any wardrobe Always in style

The shoes are classic I had a pair in high school and I just kept buying them for 30 years

Very stylish and very sleek as well as being incredibly comfortable

Reliable dependable good looking and comfortable

Are you kidding meStan Smiths need no description they are the past present and future of what it means to perfect the shoe

First things first they are classics that are relatively affordable Secondly they go with any outfit Finally they are very comfortable Only thing I would love to see from Adidas is an affordable boost version of the shoe

I like the way the shoe feels and looks Been wanting to buy me a pair for awhile

Exactly as it is always been Classic white sneaker with endless versatility Be ordering another pair soon

My shoe in black is an accurately sized and well made tennis shoe that can be worn with casual slacks jeans and of course shorts Well done Adidas

Classic style that goes with a lot of stuff Stan smiths never go out of style Quality leather I usually wear a 10 5 and that is what I bought but they run big bc I have more room at the front than normal 10 5 with Adidas Overall I love them though

the quality good as I expected the size was a bit bigger than I thought

These kicks are sexy bro My life has changed with them

Bought these for my son and he loved them and this classic look is timeless

These are my 4th pair and I love them so much I love the color and if you take good care of them they stay nice and white

I have had the shoes for two weeks now and i must say they fit really well and go with just about every outfit Will probably but these again at some point

They are wonderfully I loved red is a classic sport style on the world they are perfect

One of the greatest shoe ever Runs a size big my UB are a size 8 and went to a 7 in the Stans Comfort day after day Hardest test I put the shoes through was a week in NYC walking more than 50mi across 4 5 days Never felt discomfort during the trip

Stan Smith adidas or very reliable and durable I plan on buying more

I have bought a dozen like this over a few yearsworks perfectly for me

Well constructed for crappy environments I use them in

I usually wear a women 9 5 and i ordered an 8 5 in this show because of the change in sizing It may be a little big but it is too late for me to switch to a smaller size since I have already worn them once Will still work though

The shoes are a great style and quality They fit true to size

TOO BIG Had to order half a size smaller than my size

I like them because I like pharell and pharell likes me

Classic classy cool comfortable kicks Look sweet and comfortable enough to walk for miles in

I like the product because it is a nice leather shoe and matches well with everything

Nothing glamorous comes from this shoe but that is not what you buy stan smiths for I bought these for the simplicity and the silhouette both of which satisfies what I am looking for in a sneaker

Pairs well with many outfits White Red is a dope combo

Great shoes comfortable and nice to wear to casual outings

I think the shoe is a classic but I do not really think this shoe is the best quality product they offer

I wear a 12 Wide I did not see an option for a width So far they are not uncomfortable Are they supposed to stretch

Good product i like it so much I already had two other pair but different colors i love them

This was the perfect gift for our son so much so that I had to are order a pair for dad

The silhouette is classic and amazing The shoe also ages well

great design very happy with delivery and product quality

Love the quality and comfort of Adidas these check all the boxes style included

I really like the shoes They look great and are super comfortable

Make sure you go a half or full size down I did not listen to other reviews and here I am returning them These are great shoes though

I had a pair when I was younger but they stopped making them When I heard they were back I was really excited My wife bought them for me as a Christmas gift

Classic and stylish look Very comfortable Very satisfied with purchase

Because it was delivered b4 Xmas and my son loved it

Forget every other brand

i like this product because the shoes are very comfortable and they are very nice looking

My favorite pair of shoes for every occasion I rotate them out from daily wear to gardening shoes when they get worn down then I buy another of the same pair and repeat the cycle I have also gotten family members to get on the Stan Smiths train Love these shoes

I have been wearing this shoe both on the court and off since the 1980It is simply the best and best looking tennis show on the market

Awesome footwear Cut is a bit large Go 1 2 size down

Love the old school look Goes great with jeans or chinos

Was beating around the bush on these for a minute but I saw a guy on the A train with them and seeing them IRL had me sold I love my Stans looking great comfort for days

Ultra comfortable and just so cool Love my Stans and got so many compliments immediately

The fit is right on and comfort is better than expected

Love the look and fit of this shoe Would recommend

It was exactly as expected Great quality and nice looking

The fit with a lot of outfits good quality and they are beatiful

Awesome old school Adidas They are as comfortable as I remember

adidas tried and true great shipping beautiful shoe happy husband

Perfect to dress up or dress down casual Classic shoe perfect for all occasions

Its perfect i like the qualyti everithing Its more than i expected

he is picky and does his research the feel and comfort of the shoe is why he wanted them

Love the classic style they are very very white however

Decided to buy these over the Continental 80s for my sonone pair of white sneaker It is hard to resist their perfect style

it is pretty nice amd very confortable I like to use them daily

Owned a pair of these in the 80s and they are still great

So far so good First time purchase on this product and store

First pair only lasted 34 years Will try and be more careful with this pair

The quality is great and the green trim is a perfect addition to my collection

Comfortable to wear Great purchase Getting another one next year

These look super cool Was on the fence about buying these and decided to jump the gun Was not disappointed

I love these in comparison to the superstars Great overall shoe and love the green

There are certain wardrobe staples that should be in every man closet a double or single breasted navy blazer well fitting faded jeans a tuxedo and a pair of Stan Smith sneakers a true classic

Amazing shoes classic fit and match with everything you wear

I love Stan Smith for its simple design and smooth clean look This goes with both athletic and even with semi drsss up with hint of relaxed touch

After admiring these on other women of all ages for years I finally decided to take the plunge And I am so glad I did These are the perfect shoe Not only are they timeless and comfortable but they go with everything in my wardrobe from joggers and jeans to pencil skirts and sundresses could not be happier and now wondered why it took me so long FYI they do run largeit took 2 attempts to nail the right size

Simple classic and comfortable you all love them

I have worn Rod Lavers for 25 years and I am sad you are not making them anymore but these will make an excellent replacement Thank you for always making such comfortable and stylish shoes for DECADES

Great for jeans joggers however I had to take the lace out and put it back in because the shoe was a little too wide on the sida

I love these shoes because they are very comfortable to wear go with a lot of choices of style and can be personalized

it is a classic and it lasts good value as well clean

It has been only 3 weeks but one of the shoes painting is chipping out already Poor quality

This is my second time buying a pair of these shoes and that is because they are comfortable and goood looking

This shoe is comfortable and looks good with just about anything

awesome shoe would buy again delivered right on time

Cause I had a Stan Smith 11 1 2 inch earlier but it is way narrower compared to that

The Stan Smith Sneaker is the most comfortable I ever owned It holds my foot in just the right proportion of balance and comfort for hours and hours of wear This sneaker type actually allows me to perform longer and better I do a lot of physical activity on a daily basis and nothing offers more comfort and support I am a Stan Smith Adidas customer for life Thank you

I highly recommend this shoe It fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable Goes with just about any outfit

One of the best pair of shoes I have bought and there so comfortable

Classic Have loved them forever How can you not

I guess it is a thing with shoe sizes Other than that I love them

Love these shoes and will have forever Need a little breaking in to get leather to loosen up but perfect after a couple of wears

It goes great with everything I wear and it is easy to keep clean

the perfect shoe to dress up or dress down withfor any outfit

The Sam Smith sneakers were a great match with my outfits

My fave shoe that can match almost any outfit You gotta have a pair of these

Very versatile shoe goes pretty much with everything

the product is very good I fulfill all my expectations

Stan smith are classic and are well made to feel so comfortable Plus they look great oo

This is a shoe every guy should have in his closet Only gripe is I have a wide foot so the front sides started to crease after only a couple of wears however the shoe is quite roomy already so I would not recommend going a size up even if you have a wide foot Asides from that this is a very comfortable good looking shoe that can be paired with so many different outfit styles Buy it

The feel of the shoes is incredible the way they look and feel on my feet is great

Since my feet a bit wider than normal I was afraid that the shoes would be too narrow However the shoes fit me very well providing breathability without feeling like my foot is being crushed

These shoes are absolute heat and have been for many decades and many decades to come One of the many timeless piece that will always be relevant by Adidas Originals

Love these shoes especially with the green her tab Such a classic shoe Can never go wrong with a pair of Stan Smiths I would love to work for adidas I am in school at ODU I am Norfolk VA for Fashion Merchandising How can I get an internship in the Adidas headquarters

Overall I like the classic silhouette of the sneaker However it seems as though the leather is very cheap After just one normal wear there was a deep scuff in the left toe box that will not come out as it is too deep Also the plastic leather creases immediately upon wear As for comfort I would say they are pretty good I definitely start to notice they are on my feet after a full day of wear but no discomfort whatsoever if I am only wearing them for a short amount of time For fit I wear a 10 in ultraboost and opted for a 9 in these While they fit with the amount a thumbs width of extra space in the toe box I think that an 8 5 US would fit even better If I decide to get another pair once these wear out it should not be very long before that happens I might try another half size down because I like a snug fit with no slipping in the heel Despite the quality concerns of this shoe I am glad I bought it and it is true that they look even better with a little grit and age to themtruly an iconic sneaker

Great classics it is sad that they are mainstream now to basics that have no idea of the brand

The first time I bought them a very long time ago in Europe Even after a few years they looked great Finally I wanted to buy another one but still that model After 6 months they looked worse than the previous ones I did not want to give negative feedback too hastily so I bought them the third time And again poor quality Deep wrinkles appeared very quickly they tend to gain very visible abrasions what proves the shoes are made from low quality leather They are not as good as they used to be I also noticed in Europe the shoes were Made in Philippines and in US we have Made in China So dissapointed

these shoes are by fare the most comfortable shoes i own i can wear these shoes all day with no problems simple yet classy with comfort

I have pair of the gazelles and wanted to try something new so went for the stan smiths They are everything i hoped for and more if you are looking for a new pair of everyday shoes then i would highly recommend these the only thing is that they are about a 1 2 size big

These shoes are great for everyday use They really hold their shape and are still comfortable even after a year of daily use

It was exactly what I expected and what I wanted Shipment was flaw

True to size and comfortable I have been wearing them every day since I got them I get compliments on them all the time The perforation on the sides does not go all the way through which is nice so it helps keep your feet dry

Awesome product I will buy more adidas product comfortable shoe

Wish white was not such a hard color to maintain though

Need to size down but other than that they are great

Great Price easily match with any outfit Not great for walking all day

Both two shoes I bought he really likes it

They are a great style and perfect fit goes well with my outfit

I am team Adidas when it comes to sneakers but this wins the trophy for WORST comfort and support My ankle hurts every time I wore it so I trashed it

This product can be worn with virtually anything Extremely comfortablewore them on vacation and walked 5 7 miles daily with them and my feet never hurt

It is very perfect you will love the Stan Smith Thx adidas

Very happy with purchase but have not had them long enough to give them 5 stars At this time I would give them a 4 5 rating if I could Will try to update this review in 6 months my normal size shoe is between 10 and 10 5 Because reviews indicate that these shoes tended to be a bit on the large size I ordered a size 10 despite the fact that my feet are on the wide side Glad I did since 10 5 would have been too large

Have worn and loved the Stan Smith shoe in the past but somehow I am now between sizes 9 5 too small 100 too big Sad because I realy love the style

I have been wearing these for years and could purchase them locally at will Now they are a seasonal item in a city of almost 2M people The shoes are now narrower at the toes I could have found this out if I was able to try them on in person Addidas management web developers and marketing staff are incompetent

Comfortable and nice The longer I have been wearing them the more it is getting soft and comfortable because it is leatherette nice

My sister had gotten superstars just before me and I tried them on to get a reference as to which shoe size I wanted However her shoes had cloudfoam memory foam so when I received my shoes they were about one size too big

No other sneaker compares Been rocking these since 19

it is comfortable and fantastic I recommend it to all adidas lovers

I love these cause you can dress them up and dress them down Hands down my fave sneakers

Classic style and it suites my taste and thats all

Size quality all good Can ask for more Like them very much

Great product The absolute gold standard for leather white sneakers Fits a bit large

Great everything thing I wear them with suit chinos jeans and shorts You should keep these in your closet

I wear a size 8 in women and brought a 6 in men They fit perfectly except the sides are narrow and rubs against my feet when I walk Maybe I need to break them in some more

Overall they are good 

I really recommend the Stan smith editions Maximum quality and durability they also ad a vintage touch to your look

Im a 7 1 2 I ordered the 7 it was too big I prob needed a 6 I returned it

Have worn Stan Smiths for over 40 years Love them

I have been needing to get new shoes as my current shoes were not the best for walking these are better on my feet than my last pair

This is the first time I have bought this classic shoe and it did not disappoint The silhouette is clean the leather is a pretty good quality One thing though is this shoe runs really small at least for me I originally bought a 9 5 cause that is my size for NMDs but it was way too big Had to return it for 8 5 but that is still too big I could honestly wear a 8 or maybe even 7 5 Definitely try this shoe on before purchasing

I wore these back in the 80s and putting them on made me feel I was transported back the style the feel and the quality Adidas is the best

Love these Shoes A great shoe for a very reasonable price with the Quality you expect from Adidas

Superior quality and styling Very pleased Ordering another pair

This is the only shoe that fits me perfectly I would recommend it is a timeless classic You can not go wrong

Aunt loves them to wear to work and out with her friends she gets compliments all the time

These are fine shoes and demonstrate superb quality

Shoe can be dressed up or down Very comfortable stylish great materials

I had several pairs of these many years ago and liked the idea of the cult following But the sole liner was so thin the shoes are uncomfortable and i had to my some Dr Schollliners to make them more comfortable I think the size 10 1 2 is correct but they feel tight and just are not pleasant to wear Maybe after they loosen up they will be better

i had those shoes when i was a teen and i love them

Stan smith shoes look clean but that is the only positive I have found The shoe feels cheaply made and I am not sure its going to hold up to normal wear The stripes in this case the punched ventilation holes were not completely punched out on one side of the right shoe I wear a 10 1 2 but after reading that the shoe runs large I ordered a size 10 and it is still a 1 2 size to large If you are on your feet for an extended period of time these shoes are less than comfortable

I am a woman with a wide foot I usually wear a size 9 in womenshoes I ordered these in a mensize 7 and they fit perfectly since menshoes are generally wider Love them and with the red trim I get compliments every time I wear them

This shoe is extremely comfortable and stylish It is a classic shoe that can be dressed up or down

Best shoes ever Took me 4 months to find them again Wish I could afford to buy all colors avail Incase they go out of stock can not find in any store Please do not discontinue or change anything This shoe is perfect for work or play

I live in these everyday at work and play and have for years I wish they were still discounted at the employee store as they were in the past

Product is a staple in my wardrobe Issue I have was the shoes labeled size 10 5 were incorrect The left shouted is smaller in size and was manufactured and shipped incorrectly Shoes were returned

can not go wrong with a classic shoes Perfect fit

Great shoes pretty much sums it up Goes with a lot of outfits and is classic because of that minimalistic style I would recommend these to anyone

I will be wearing stands minutes till the day I die

Great shoes Had to get half a size smaller because they run a bit large

Classic style and great quality Stan Smith in classic green is always the right way to go

I like the product and I recommend it to my friends

Love the retro Had a pair 45 years ago I find these shoes run large Get the next size down Although love the look the do not offer much support

classic fashionable shoe I have not black and white ones very durable after a year they start showing cracking in the material but I am very please with them can not go wring with a sun smith def have a pair in your wardrobe

Stan smiths are an icon shoe that can match with just about everything I really recommend this shoe as it has a leather upper and is very comfortable 10 10 would purchase more

These were the popular thing to wear in my high school years

Great Comfortable and Stylish Shoes My son is planning on wearing the shoes with a black slim dress pants black jacket and white shirt

Great shoe A clean and versatile shoe for almost any occasion it is not THE most comfortable shoe but definitely no wear near the worst

Great look and feel but runs a bit narrow

I have worn this shoes for 3 years nearly everyday

Love Adidas because they are ageless Quality is always great You might want to size because they run about one size large

I like the product mainly for the style but the shoe is perfect all around

This is my 3rd pair of Stan Smiths The first 2 pairs have been incredibly comfortable These hurt my feet so much I can no longer wear them Very disappointed

I love adidas Stan smith is one of the best shoes forever

I bought my second pair of Stan Smiths and I am always coming back to them They are simple and easy to wear plus very comfortable

Love this vintage look that transcends the ages Still a staple that goes with everything The best

Its Very comfortable shoe and i can use it for every ocassion

I love Stan Smiths you really can not go wrong with this classic shoe I will recommend wearing band aids on your heels while breaking them in because I got a horrible blister and now I can only wear sandals for a while

The shoes are classic Great silhouette Leather is nicebut the stitching is not as durable as I would expect from such a renowned shoe Ive had these just for just three weeksand already see picture

Shoe felt a bit narrow at the store but the break in was quick and painless I was surprise how comfortable they are Wore them to work on casual Friday with dark jeans polo and got several compliments Same weekend with some shorts and a neck and again got some compliments Very versatile sneaker I hope they last Thanks

I like this product because they look Sharp with everything i wear

I imagined that the material would be leather for the top

I like them because I can wear these anywhere These shoes are very nice

They are just like I remember them from the early 80 

White always looks great Fit is good Would definitely recommend everyone to own a pair of these

Love these shoes I do not know why everyone is saying they do not fit true to size mine fit as perfect as any other shoe in my size Simple and will go with anything you are wearing

Classic cool white sneaker Comfortable and can wear dressy or casual

This shoe is a classic and works with all outfits on anybody The shoe comes a whole to a half size large so I would really recommend sizing down I am a Nike size 9 5 and I know they run small So I ordered a 10 in these shoes They are too large for me and now I am going to order a size 9 so do not make the same mistake But the quality of the shoe is amazing and it looks amazing Over all I highly recommend it

i love the look and style of the shoe and it matches outfits easily do not like how the leather creases so easily but it is fine and easy to wipe when dirt gets on it runs REALLY big usually between a size 6 5 7 and had to get a 5 5 in this when I bought i was worried about comfort but it only took a couple days for the shoe to break in has lots of padding

Love these classic shoes I am a woman and usually wear a women US 7 5 but wear a women 6 5 in other adidas styles like the Gazelle and the men size 5 fit me perfectly So glad I was able to snag a pair of these in the white navy combo as they have been hard to find

i got these shoes about a year ago and i have worn them almost everyday since i have very high arches and the soles have great support everything about the shoes are comfortable and i have never gotten a blister from them although when walking around the tongue of the shoes goes off to the outside which is weird and annoying also the white has chipped off significantly all over the shoe keep in mind they are roughly worn and I have had them for a while but that started happening a while ago

look great with jeans

Like a lot of reviews on here the shoes do run a tad bigger I have wider feet so the size difference did not matter They fit perfectly without squeezing my toes and are incredibly comfortable If you do not have wide feet maybe consider going down a half size

I have been wearing Stan Smiths for over twenty years and they are fantastic A true classic that can be dressed up or down They break in nicely after only a couple of wears and will probably become the most comfortable lifestyle trainers you own They run about a half size larger than adidas Superstars so keep that in mind when ordering

Love the look of the shoe and it is very comfortable A hole formed in the bottom of the sole and it made them unwearable because it spread very quickly

Very comfortable and durable I would recommend this shoe to anyone

Wore them for years glad Adidas brought them back

They are a Classic tennis shoes like how comfortable are love in green color I use them since I was in High School

Stan Smith Shoes is really comfortable I wear it with jeans or suits

Dope classic shoe and I also love the classic all white shoe with just a dab of green Great shoe

I can wear then in both informal and formal settings

This is my 12th pair of Stan Smith shoes and they are so comfortable and old SchoolJust love them

These are the only tennis shoes my husband wears Has been wearing them for at least 30 years he even bought them for our 6 and 3 year old grandsons However it is getting harder to find them seems like they are always sold out

Love it Some things never change Same style in the 80

I originally wore the Adidas Stan Smith for playing tennis when I was a young man Now I wear them as a boat shoe and every day casual shoe They are comfortable out of the box they have a great gripping sole and they are durable

it is a great product to match with any type of pants

If you have not gotten these you should I am debating on getting them in another color

Like these shoes nice look comfortable and elegant can match a weekend barbeque party or an elegant dress with an alternative touch

Very good looking Great design Not very comfortable though

Always perfect quality and of course the brand name make you feel good wearing them

Classic shoes is always one of the best style

Great shoe Timeless design very comfortable to do every day tasks in

The best dress sneakers ever recommend to every one

I have been waring the same model for 45 years I like them and the quality has been consistent Access has improved with internet sales

Nice and stylish but mine in particular came with the tip deformed they are not completely round as if there was a problem in the production

I would like to say that I was recently in Paris and I found their selection much more interesting and extensive The options in NYC were very limited

Great purchase quick arrival perfect size perfect

You never slip Best gripping tennis shoe of all time

I have allways liked the size fit and feel of addidas brand shoes

Comfortable nice looking shoe fit perfect every time

Had this shoes 20 years ago Decided to get one again This model do not go out of style

They look good with everything very classy stylish and sophisticated

Great shoes Normally a size 12 but these in 11 5 are perfect

I went with a half size smaller than what I usually get 8 5M and found that they were too narrow though I have still worn them for almost a year now The length is fine but the shoe looks too small on me and my foot falls off the inside edge Somehow they are still comfortable to wear though Will be trying my true size 9M and adding some wearable shoetrees to make the toebox smaller

Great price for the all white parties so fresh so clean for the summer

I ordered a size 14 These were very narrow but they do look nice

The shoe is a classic beauty and super comfortable The more you wear them the better it fitswalking around NYC all day in them did not hurt my feet or back The white is superb and they look great with anything you wear They do run a little big I highly recommend the shoe

Classic Stan Smiths in all black go with everything and great quality from Adidas as always

Coz these are one of the most comfortable shoes I have owned and they go great with all casuals

Very fast shipping

I love the sneaker I prefer the show in navy I purchased the sneaker for my son graduation

Size is not as the same size for super star that i am always buying

My type of sneaker super clean but flat Add socks to the shoe bundle would be dope

Great looking comfortable shoes Ordered exact size

the best sneaker in my life Cool design and comfortable

My kids love the kicks my hubby and I wore back in the day

Please keep the product in stock I need a size 10 for my son in the white blue

I wanted to find a shoe to replace my Supras and these shoes fit the bill They fit pretty well though I would probably recommend getting them a size smaller than what you would normally wear

Great quality and it fits perfectly I would recommend to anyone

Nice shoes look fine and it is not too expensive You need it

Simple not too sporty not too classy Highly suggest

great quality prompt delivery satisfied customer

Classic Style Always Fresh Cop those jawns if you know what to do

I like them because they are water proof but I do not like white They get dirty to fast

Lower quality leather than original stan Still a great looking and comfortable shoe

I am normally a women9 and the men6 5 is the perfect size for me

I was very disappointed when i opened the box i do not like the way you guys packaged my shoes I will not order from here again because it did not have any tissue supporting paper inside whatsoever It seems to me that it looks like a returned product

They look to good with anything I sport

Classic shoes that pairs with almost all of jeans and pants

I would not say they are the worst shoes in the world they are far from it but there are some things I should mention to people considering buying the shoe The first is that they do sort of crease a lot for me at least Perhaps I just do not take as good care of them as others but it is definitely something you want to be weary of The first time I wore them out they squeaked a lot as well but that is really a minor issue have not heard anything since then In terms of size they fit rather large I ordered a 1 2 size lower than I usually do for other shoes but even then I find that they still fit loose on me They also seem to be rather comfy shoes so far I would not say they are as comfortable as something like an Ultra Boost but it is not like you are stepping on bricks either they are also very versatile as well wearing them with a good white polo shirt and khaki chinos looks great This review has become rather long but just one more point I promise As a rather skinny individual I feel like these do not look too great with shorts If you are a rather muscular person or at least have legs that do not really look like twigs they will look good on you I unfortunately have to wear them with pants almost exclusively or else they really emphasize the thinness of my legs

Always wanted these sneakers Love them Want to buy in more colors Gonna buy for daughter

The show is very comfortable but the material can be physically altered very easily

Fantastic and attractive shoe very comfortable and only getting better with wear I usually wear an 8 but had to get these in a 7 5

Stan Smith adidas what can I say about these just classic These can go with just about everything perfect fit classic look

Even thought they are white it is leather meaning it is more durable does not get dirty easily and can also be cleaned easily Yes they run big but just buy a full size smaller and you will be good to go Again leather so it will stretch a bit over time Overall very comfortable and can be worn with almost anything

They exceeded my expectations Great quality comfort and value

Great product Wished I would received a receipt with purchase

Uncomfortable shoe sole i needed a shoe i can walk in all day And this show would be great and looks very clean and elegant Unfortunately the shoe is not comfortable Also the tongue was very long It didnt sit well when the laces were done

My first pair of Adidas Originals in a long time and definitely a must have pair of sneakers to have in your wardrobe I like the overall minimalism the shoe has with the perforated three stripes and the all white upper with the colored heel tab and it looks better with age and wear in my honest opinion

They are stylish and comfortable my 16 yr old son absolutely loves them

The only issue I have with these is that they are a pain to maintain They get dirty very fast

First leather athletic shoes I have had in awhile Needs a short break in period for best comfort The leather has a strong smell that is slowly diminishing

The classic models run a half size larger I am size 10 and I had to order 9 1 2 for a good fit

I used to wear Stan Smithexclusively in the 70and 80I was so crushed when Adidas stopped making them I am happy again These are such comfortable and well made shoes I hope they will be a permanent item for Adidas again I am a female but purchased the menshoes as that is what I wore then Remember to get 1 1 2 sizes down from the womensizes I wear an 8 and ordered a 6 1 2

I like them because of classic lines simplicity and comfort The shoes are well sized Only complaint is the tongue is a tad long

I love these shoes Looks great in the all black color scheme If you have wide feet you will have to go up a half size This shoe will keep you comfortable even in all day use I highly recommend these shoes

Stan Smiths stand out as one of the best shoes Adidas has ever made I thoroughly enjoy the aesthetics and the comfort of the shoes The width is slightly narrow in the toe box but eventually it fits to your feet Stay true to size I purchased the navy blue accent instead of the classic green it is a great alternative

Great looking shoes But in my case I had to reorder in a 1 2 size smaller

Not only am I white but can look fly as heck wearin these shoes but they are comfy as all get out I wish I could wear them every day for the rest of my life

I love these shoes so much that my recent purchase was my second pair I had my first pair for about 8 months and wore them almost every day because they are so comfortable I love the green color because it compliments my wardrobe very well but I am sure the other colors are just as good there is a reason these shoes are so popular and it is because they have the comfort factor and the support every foot needs

My son has size 14 feet and I was thrilled to find something he liked that was in his size and we didnt have to go to a mall to find them

Shoes are very comfortable and wear great guess that is why I have owned about 10 pair over my 50 year life span

I have slightly wide feet and these fit tts I recommend trying them on first You can not get a better value for white leather shoes You can dress them up and dress them down easily Great product and it is no wonder why these are a classic

They arrived super fast and were exactly what I wanted

The shoes becomes oversized and wrinkly in a very small period of time i would not recommend as a daily wear as they get oversized and uncomfortable

Recommend shoe

I am usually size 7 for woman but I took size 5 5 for men

Really easy to crease from the sides also very narrow

In womenshoes I am normally a size around 8 depending on the brand So I got a 6 in mens for this shoe They rock I love them they fit just perfectly I def recommend them Also in the sunlight they kinda look dark navy blue but idk if they are supposed to be like that sorry if they say that they are and I was not paying attention But when not paying attention to they look black back of shoe Either way I love them

Saw these on Pinterest and liked them Ordered them and voila Just as expected They look amazing and are very comfortable even without sox Definite

A classic look that you cannot go wrong with The leather quality feels very good for its price point The shoe runs bit narrow but flexible at the heel Otherwise it is very comfortable

Chuck Taylor it is over Stan Smith is my new guy and he is fantastic Sorry not sorry

I like the product for how it looks and feels At first it left some space in the heel area but after breaking in the shoe that space has gone and they are really good every day shoes They fit good they are comfortable and stylish What more does a shoe need

I like them because of their vibrant color red and nice look

I really loved the style of this shoe and it is incredibly comfortable the only complaint I would have is how the leather creases after normal wear Not a major thing though

These were my first pair of Stan Smiths and I am so happy with my purchase They are really sleek and stylish looking I love that the three stripes are subtle air perforations Also a big fan of the smooth front instead of the ridges on some of the white options Definitely recommend these to everyone as a wardrobe staple

Perfect mix of comfort and style Formal or Informal goes with every look

As usual I know my size perfectly with Adidas I have been looking for a good pair of solid black shoes and these are perfect

Everything I expected the softness of the leather and the finish super cool

Classic shoe that should be in all rotations Bring the orange heel back

Classic shoe very comfortable I would size down

the only issue i had the size so order one size less than your actual size otherwise the quality is overall great

All black Stans are so versatilefinally an elegant edition to the Stan Smith line best used for casual night out

All good love them first pair in 25 years just like I remember

I just have one thing to sayIf your stan smith got old and cant be carried anymore buy another pair of and voil xc3 xa0 you got your score back

Amazing I love the look at the shoe in generally and i look so good

Hey Loving these shoes beautiful and fit near perfect despite being a TINY bit too narrow but wearing thin dress socks fixes that Great quality and very comfortable more so than most sneakers I have owned

My enjoyment of the shoe goes back to the originals when Stan Smith was playing tennis I like the simplicity and style of the shoe

The best all around shoe for me One minor flaw twice in the past several years a pair would have the top front left shoe wider than the right shoe This happened in this most recent purchase

The shoes are a comfortable daily wear and are priced fairly well

Good quality comfortable throwback to one of the shoes that made Adidas popular to begin with Love them

I absolutley love these shoes They just seen to be a little bit narrow at the toes part or I do not know If I wear them too long I get a blister on my little toe But they are still super cool and I still love them

A really great shoe feels comfy and very stylish

PLEASE NEVER EVER STOP MAKING THESE SHOES STAN SMITH MUST LIVE ON Such a good well rounded shoe I hope these live forever They are so comfy right out of the box and mix well with all outfits

Style look comfort one of the best made adidas wear

I really like how the shoe looks the heel comes up a bit high and needs longer socks

Shoes are attractive well made very comfortable and stand up well to the abuse of playing tennis

We need a larger size So I will need a return Can you please send me return instructions Thank you

Great Product and they fit well and look very nice Would definitely recommend these shoes

Best price and the quality is great and i will tell your company to my frieds

Ordered a size down and they are perfect Love the look and how they fit with my wardrobe

Great shoes but even though I have other 10 pairs of shoes all of them 10 5 size these feel more loose when I walk

This sneaker is the ultimate low profile classic sneaker Can be also worn in an elegant and sporty way with a blazer combined with a pair of jeans or slim rolled up dress pants Timeless and simple

This shoes are very comfortable shoes I love them

I have always loved adidas products and always will

It is a good quality product and it is a good price

I simply have had great respect to Adidas brand most of my fifty years of age And I will continue to support your brand

This shoe can go with any outfit is extremely comfortable and a great price

The shoes are comfortable and always a great choice with casual clothes

Stan Smith shoes have the best soles for handball and they are pretty good for hiking too I am so glad that Adidas brought these back

This a classic from Adidas and it is together with Adidas Superstar the best sneaker you can wear Perfect to get wet during summer sesion mud in mud races or just to wear it in every situation work university

I love Stan Smith shoes I have 4 pairs but I think they get wrinkly too fast

priced right shipped to the door

Based on reviews on these sneakers I had to try them out and love the look feel and comfort I only wished I knew about them 20 years ago

The Stan Smith is a classic They go with any outfit and can be worn without socks Perfect for summertime flexing And at this price how could I not double up

These shoes look great and are very comfortable Everyone in our family has a pair

They just never go out of style I can wear with leggings or jeans and always always feel I look greataddidasrockstansmithlovemystans

Just do not be afraid to get them a little dirty A classic must have for a stylish man

Is a good looking pair but with the past of the time the painting of the shoes looks like it is broken

this product is light weight and durable it is comfortable to wear

It was a super reasonable price So reasonable that I bought 2 I am extremely happy and will be buying more Adidas in the future

They match with everything and are a decent comfortable shoe

it is a reliable product that I have worn for 35 years Good prices and efficient service

Only shoe my husband will wear for tennis and off the court Hard to find at times especially 9 5Need more production I buy two pair when I do find them

I do not know why there always limits quantity And always not available for navy blue stan smith

Good product fast shipping Very stylish and comfortable to wear

Only a tiny flaw or two So small I am probably the only one that notices as I am a bit over the top with checking my shoes quality out

Love these shoes they go with everything and look great Cannot beat the quality of full grain leather sneakers for the price Highly recommend

Love the shoes just a little small for my wife feet

Dad loves the shoes that i bought for him Will definitely purchase next time

The shoes are HUGE I own many pairs of shoes and wear 11 in every shoe this one fits larger than my roommates size 12 Absolutely ridiculous

Awesome fit love the comfort would recommend shoe to everyone

Comfortable and stylish pair of shoe Leather is great for col weather

Easy to clean and super stylish A great buy any way you put it The leather gets dirty but cleans with ease making them last a very long time I am in love with them

It was what I was expecting and shipment was fast

These shoes are almost identical to the pair I wore to play tennis in the early 70 so did everyone else The only difference I noticed is the tongue although memory fades a bit over 45 years They will serve perfectly as casual sneakers and occasionally for indoor Pickleball

have been wearing them since the 90always a good fit and color matches Have had green navy and white trims

The shoes are comfortable and look great Shipping was extremely fast

The quality of this product was horrible and it is not worthy of even being sold at an outlet store

I have had a fresh pair of Stan Smiths as part of my wardrobe for the past 15 years They look great with jeans chinos and shortsthey are very versatile They are also suitable for leg day squats and deadlifts due to the flatness of the sole

Definitely recommend

I have always been a fan of the OG Stans finally got to get them at the right price and I do not regret it at all

These are my first pair of Stan Smiths They are very comfortable and look great I will probably get another pair once this pair wears out although these shoes seem to be very durable for casual shoes

Classic clean shoe can not wait to get them broke in and a little dirty so I will be reminded of a pair I Gaf years ago

very nice classic shoes can wear with business casual or everyday outfits

it is comfortable and great quality I would recommend these shoes to anyone getting the other colors soon

I was very disappointed when Adidas discontinued the Stan Smith shoe and delighted when they brought it back CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMI believe the online buying experience could be improved

it is a great shoe I plan on buying more shoes from adidas

Shoe looks great It is too tight on the sides though A bit too small though every other shoe I own in this size fits perfect So I am not sure why this one is like it It is great quality though I recommend it still

Though I own several Adidas shoes this model is by far the most irregular in terms of sizing

Comfortable shoes that last a long time and are very stylish Overall happy with the purchase

gets dirty easy and makes my feet hurt after wearing all day

Have A Happy Holiday Addidas Team

Great classic show Fit as expected Looks fresh and clean

I like it it is clean and fashionable I will recommend this to friends and family

I do not received the order until now Next time I am not ordering on line

Beautiful looking shoe that will go with pretty much anything in your wardrobe Very stylish and comfortable to wear and I do not mind the leather uppers creasing in my opinion it gives it personality and makes it uniquely yours Toe to heal it runs true to size however the shoe does run a bit narrow I am guessing it is just designed that way I did not size up as it made it too big for my tastes All in all just a great shoe to have in your collection

high quality construction for a reasonable price

Stylish stays clean and comfort can wear with every outfits

My son wanted a new pair of these shoes and he has an older pair and loves them

I just got this today and it have a crease in the toe area and minor scratch in the side of the shoe Been a customer of adidas for many year I am very disappointed

I like how the shoes fit on my foot Other Adidas shoes fit a tad small at 11 and I had to return them but these feel pretty nice

My boyfriend loves the style and the comfort He has the all black all white and the white with navy blue He loves them

Super versatile Goes with everything and very stylish

My first pair of Adidas and could not be more pleased

OLD SCHOOL IS THE BEST AND THE STYLE FITS EVERYONE

Great shoe great stylish shoe love it

Wanted to upgrade my white shoes Best recommendation ever

These fit perfectly and they are nice looking and comfortable I have two pairs

Flash back wearing for 1974 Varsity Tennis West Allis Wisconsin

have worn these since I was young and I am old now and they are consistently awesome

it is almost impossible to find an all black comfortable shoe in a size 20 This shoe is really nice with a good price and fast shipping

These shoes are really easy to clean with a wet rag or towel

Great shoe super comfortable and goes well with school uniforms too

Adidas done it again nice sneaker and delivery was prompt

I was very careful when wearing my new Adidas and try not to bend it when I walk But the shoes started to have wrinkles and looked old now I am very disappointed the shoes is expensive

Because they look and feel exactly what I thought it would It met my expectations

Dress it up dress it down This shoe is for everything

Product was actually a gift for my father he has had these when he was younger and loves the look and comfort

As a college student I am always on my feet walking from here to there and with colder weather coming up I wanted some shoes that were hardy and fun to wear These have met all of my expectations They go with ANY outfit and are so comfy you just never want to take them off Walking is a joy when your shoes are like this If you are on the fence BUY THEM NOW

classic and old fashioned but this is the point that gather my attention

I xef xb8 x8f Love the shoe but it feels a tad bit tight but it is fine I xef xb8 x8f got a 6 5 in men but next time I xef xb8 x8f will get a size up

The shoes fit style and are extremely comfortable

I love this product because I can put my name on them

look exactly like the pictures and excellent quality as usual

stan smith always great

These Stans are my first purchase off of the Adidas website and I am very pleased They look very sharp and are comfortable

I love these shoes simple design executed perfectly They get more comfortable the more you wear them

I have gone through who knows how many pairs of white green trim SSs since about 1970 They look and feel great with any casual wear They do not actually wear out just get so dirty scratched that is becomes time to pass them along Recently bought my 1st pair of other than white green black and glad I finally did They look great too

Iconic the original that all designers have copied need more colors in Stan smith i own all of them currently

I finally got bought myself a pair of Stan Smithand I am very pleased with my purchase Not only were they very reasonably priced but the quality is outstanding I believe that every man should own a pair of white leather sneakers and Stan Smiths were the original They go with anythingwhether you are wearing athleisure wear shorts and a tshirt jeans and a button down or you want to dress down a suit these shoes do the trick

I like the style I do not like the leather quality or arch support The leather creases on the inside of the shoe too much I would suggest more arch support on the inner part of the shoe to prevent creasing

Well made and last longer than most similar tennis shoes Wear them for everything

I love these shoes I had to buy a size up from my regular sneaker size

since it has all size with the same kind for my family

Because this shoe has class and is comfortable I realy love the look

The sneaker is overall nice quality and comfy it is simple and goes great with anything Only complaint is that it runs big I had to exchange it in store I am a true size 9 but exchanged it for 8 1 2

Look like the original Stanall the way down to the colors

Excellent item everything is perfect Adidas is a great brand

I liked it because it was the style that stood out

I was hoping they might stretchbut no such luck

I enjoy the reliability of the product The look has a universal appeal

I like his product because it is very stylish comfortable clean look and it is just great I have gotten so many compliments about my shoes They are great with daily outfits and everything



Its nice and wide works extremely well with black pants great confidence booster

These shoes fit great and look great and there very comfortable

Nice shoes comfortable and fit well I recommend them It is annoying that my review has to be a certain length

good looking shoe could use a better sole goes well with all dress style

These are EVERYWHERE in New York Which is a good thing I wanted them months ago and I did not buy them I could have beat the crowds it is never too like Now I have to buy my GF a pair

Look great Light Feel good on Could be a little wider and a little more arch support Great buy for the price

it is very comfortable and fits perfectly true to size

I have been wearing this shoe for 4 decades for Tennis I find them comfortable on the court and I can count on the quality and performance it is not their fault if I miss a shot

I like this product because it is nice and casual and can wear it with anything

TOO BIG Mensize 9 5 looked and felt like size 11

Clean looking white leather or black Boost great

Had these same shoes in the 80and glad they are back

The shose very Comfortable I buy this shoes give my friend more

Love red and love the Stan Smiths but I wish Adidassizing was consistent Had to go down half a size my true size is 10 5

liked the shoes but sole wore out quickly working outside

I love the look of the shoe that is until you start moving The leather is very thing so when you move in the shoes they look all wrinkled and the leather spreads over the sole making the shoe look ill fitted

The style the color the overall shoe is dope

I have been wearing these for 30 years They never go out of style comfortable and they last

These are my first Stan Smith shoes I buy and let me tell you The comfort is real I am a daily walker and my feet do not hurt I definitely will buy again

Love the stan smith shoe for years Finally got a pair in black And they are awsome Just as comfy as the others

Purchased these shoes as a gift and he loves them

I wish the tongue was original thin leather I do not like the thick paded tongue

Super rad Love these Good cop for sure Looks good with everything

Love it cool design But little bit hurt when you walked in long time

I like adidas shoes stem smith white nice and clean

I like my product because it was exactly what I ordered and I received it with no issue

Adidas sent me these shoes used There were scuffs on the bottoms sides and top Also the shoes were already creased BEWARE WHEN BUYING THESE

Not much cushioning and as I said although size 12 usually accommodates my orthotics these were a poor fit

The fit is perfect the style is timeless and the shipping purchase process could not be easier

Great price for such a good quality shoes Also very light and easy on my feets

it is perfect for a casual date I highly recommend them

it is one of the best shoes i have purchased that is Adidas

I have been a Stan Smith Sneaker fan since the 80Love the fit Everyone keep asking where I get them fromAdidas com

I like it is Classic style and goes with everything

Both my boys 20 22 have a pair and love the comfort and the style

I am very pleased with these sneakers I had a pair as a child and always liked them I do think that they are a bit overpriced should be more like 50 a pair but I was very pleased with the speedy and free shipping Already received a few complimentsthese look great with jeans

These are the only casual shoe my boyfriend wears He loves them and they fit him very well Have to buy a new pair every time he wears out the old pair Great product

Fantastic shoe Work well with everything Happy I bought these

I would forgotten how much I missed my Stans from back in the day Lately I have been updating my wardrobe including my shoes As I got older it was easy to go for the slip ons for work and play and it suddenly hit me that they all look the same It was time for a change so I knew my first pair of sneakers had to be some white leather Stans They are were even better than I remember and the fact I that could personalize them was so cool My wife was somewhat shocked when she saw her name on one and mine on the other A fitting tribute to myself my wife and Stan the Man Adidas rocks next week we will be in Manhattan for my birthday and we will be stopping by the flagship store so I can pick up my new Superstars

These sneakers are really comfortable and stylish I think that these fit me well personally and they are a great buy

Consistent quality that has remained unchanged but is still just as functional as ever

does not go out of style it is a simple design

They wear well and last long and have been available for purchase since they were invented

I love everything about the Stan Smiths from the quality of the leather to the lightweight and comfortability of the shoe to the classic look and style This shoe is very versatile allowing you to rock them with different outfits The only thing that I hate about the shoe is the way it squeaks when I walk or simply step from one foot to the other With some adjusting of the tongue and laces the squeaking will temporarily go away but will return as I walk I do not know if this problem happens to anyone else but this is one of the reasons why I do not rock the shoe too often the squeaking is really an attention grabber especially in quiet areas

Been wearing Stans since the 70classic styling This new version is narrower and not stitched all around on the sole like previous editions but lighter weight Give them a try

Stan Smithare a very nice casual pair of shoes perfect for any event that does not include alot of walking

Style like the shoes want a Black Trime pair All the Best

I have been wearing these shoes for forty years as they fit my foot very well These new ones no longer fit and the overall quality is not as good They are to small and the arch support is now missing no longer comfortable to my foot Will need to find something else

These shoes run big so in the future I would order a size smaller Otherwise very happy with my purchase look and quality of the shoe

Exact size color my son had been looking for as he was unable to find in store

If you wear these chances are you have good style These shoes look good with most outfits They are a great shoe for summer paired with causal clothing

Because the unique color looking quality and classic Stan smith model

I like the shoe is very comfortable and comfortable I would recommend it to my friends

I love the style it fits all my outfits with my uniform and with suite as well

Stan Smith is a classic look Exactly what I was going for

Love the colorway and its versatility with any type of outfit Best purchase of sneakers I made all year

Classic stylish shoes can not go wrong with a pair

Beautiful clean design I really like them My heel pops out just a little bit but overall that is the size I need to have with Adidas

very uncomfortable returned it for a different style Stan Smith

Loved the product but I had to exchange the first pair because they run too big so I had to size down from my original shoe size

I absolutely love Stan Smith original sneakers best quality and will always be an amazing classic style Must have

Would like to return the material feels cheap and not sufficient

I like the style of the show I hate the fact that the front rips easily

Great sneaker great fit Very happy Highly recommend

The sneakers are really comfortable and good for the summer time because they are not too hot Got a lot of compliments and I am planning on buying more in different colors

This shoe is very nice I ordered the Navy White pair and it looks very good The Navy is really dark and looks black unless you look closely Order half a size smaller than usual if you are looking for a good fit

They look dapper with the right clothes I am going to order another pair

I like the product because it goes with most of my clothes and I like to match when I wear stuff so yes They are very comfortable and stylish and I would recommend these to a lot of people

I play tennis and I really wanted a shoe to play good in and this shoe was perfect

These shoes are a classic and look better the longer you wear them I customized a pair for myself

Wish the back was green like the white ones I think I would look better

Great shoe may want to have the show a half size larger but regardless is fantastic in terms of quality and fit

Pretty good price for a pair of shoes I absolutely love

The size that held my heel was too short The size that was long enough did not hold my heel and felt like a clown shoe

Very confortable nice look very high quality sport shoe

Past years insoles was more arch support Now flat

Classic and stylish sneaker that works with suits or jeans without missing a beat

I would tell people to buy this product only if you have narrow feet Wide feet people stay away

love the look love the look love the look ok

i put the shoes on and i was transported back to the days when Stan Smith was still playing Then i climbed a flight of stairs and that high was quickly gone i have always loved the classic look of these shoes and nothing has diminished that

They look great with anything you wear also very comfortable

Great shoe at a great price This is a classic for a reason

I like this kinda style because of how casual it is It does not stray too much on the eye to be focused on which is nice

Looks fresh Fits perfectly Really comfortable Nice

Nice clean look would recommend to all people that want something simple

Very simple and easy to match with Ideal for minimalist people

Looks great with a lot of outfits Wrinkles easily though and a bit stiff at first

Shoes had creases in them prior to wearing them

These shoes are longer for sneakers and run on the narrow side I would say that it is true to size for length based on Brannock but it is narrow so you may need to size up The shoes are very comfortable but I wish these did not have the padded tongue although it probably helps with the comfort

My son really enjoys the look and feel of these shoes

Love this shoe it is so versatile and easy go to sneaker

Very bad quality on wearing just 2 times It looks like when someone order online Adidas send the worst things that they have I will not recommend

I love it bc it is comfy and amazing you should buy and cop

My only problem with these shoes is that they are a little narrow in the toe area Wish Adidas came in wider widths As we get older our feet our less forgiving with a fit that is not totally comfortable for athletic shoes

Authentic classic but still feels contemporary and cool

I like that shoes I macth the shoes with my family everybody likes

Fit and Fashion style comfort color retro ease

Plenty of room in the toe Pretty comfortable after working on a concrete floor with no mat for 10 12 hours

Nice classic shoes from Adidas Sometimes you have to go with originals

These Stan Smith shoes are very comfortable and look great with all sorts of outfits Great walking shoe Can wear with shorts or jeans and look great Nice job with keeping these shoes around

I love the Stan Smith shoes You can dress up or down The most comfortable ever All my family is in love with ADIDAS Always

It was a mensneaker it was too large Just need the right size

They are cool No really they are cool Did I mention they are cool

I really like the shoes comfortable stylish reasonably priced

Customised lettering could be larger Otherwise they are great

Not upto the mark quality not as i expected product looks different in real and in picture

The Stan smith is a solid shoe I think I messed up and bought a half size too big which causes it to tease oddly in the toe are Other than that the shoes are super comfortable and you can tell they are well made

Timeless design Awesome clean lines classic look and comfort New pair ever year in any color since I was a kid Highly recommend

I find the Stan Smithto be simple stylish versatile and affordable I am very happy with my shoes

I used to have a pair of these shoes back in the 80They are extremely comfortableso you can imagine how thrilled I was to find out that they were still available

I love these classics These are summer staples and are a must year after year

These are not bad I am curious about the boost version now Buttery soft leather too hey you can not go wrong with these I am still breaking them in so the comfort is not A1 yet I hope

Cool trying to change my babymother types of shoes and she really likes it Thanks Adidas

This show goes with everything A great price point for a show that never goes out of style

Quality of shoe was not there and uncomfortable Runs a half size big

The shoes is comfortable to wear without socks as a kick around sneaker and a completely versatile item for my wardrobe

I have been looking for these forever Almost as good as they use to be

These shoes go with about any outfit and are very high quality I wear these almost daily and they still look new

Have had a pair previously and bought a second pair because they are the most comfortable shoes I have worn

Very comfortable casual walking shoe Satisfied that they do not need any additional insoles for proper fit

So I was watching a Netflix show when I noticed one of the characters was wearing these familiar white tennis shoes with a green tab on the back instant flashback to my teen years I lived in these shoes as a teenager But never thought they were still around to actually buy anymore I could not remember the name of these until a quick Google search lead me to Adidas website where lo and behold there they were the Stan Smith originals Added to cart immediately so happy with these Thank you Adidas for bringing back a great memory from my childhood

Stylish shoe for a good price Came in a good condition without any blemishes

I have had these sneakers in the past and it does seem like the quality of the leather is not as good as it used to be It also feels as if they fit a bit narrow

I love the quality and the feel of them The look old school and cool

I always wanted to own a Stan Smith shoes They are very comfortable and make a great summer shoes

Quality poor I wore it once and started folding

Fashion younger sports I like it

Love the style and shape the package came on time

Very nice and look so cute first time just place one pair for my hubby and he liked it so much then I placed 3 more pairs for my self and my two little boys

because the shoes are composed from too much plastic

The leather exterior is stiff and shiny This is not the right shoe if you want a casual look Seems solidly constructed A little uncomfortable due to the stiffness

I bought these in the same size as my old Sambas and they fit perfectly and are comfortable to wear all day in our busy shop I probably walk several miles a day and my feet do not hurt at the end of the workday will have to see about the durability as time goes by

I like this show however it does not come in a 12 1 2

So glad you brought these back Great fit quality leather and they look great Love them

They are comfortable stylish classic and the personalization bit makes a ton of a difference Definitely recommend it to everyone

They are Stan Smiths what is not to likeSmith

I love the designs and comfortable materials will buy more

This product is great quality and very in style now

Great classic shoe with great comfort and looks which goes with anything

Shoes are top Classic look that can be dressed up or down

I like shoe style so much so simple and perfect i think it is one of the best shoe that adidas produce and for sure superstar also

I love the shoes but they are hard to style Overall great

it is classic it is comfortable It goes with everything Whether you are a sneakerhead or just looking for a pair you need a pair of classic Stan Smiths

good fit quality and looks These shoes are pretty fresh and have a great light feel to them I got a matching pair with my girlfriend and they look pretty lit Also these shoes look great with shorts which is important for this summer season fit is a little narrow so i wouldnt recommend for people with wide feet

Perfect beater shoes I wear them almost everyday and I get a bunch of compliments

This is my first time to wear Stan smith and it is comfortable

I got these shoes mostly for work and they have been perfect so far I am pretty much on my feet 10 or so hours a day and these have held up nicely I have been wearing them for about 3 months or so and the only think keeping them from looking new is the wear marks on the outside where my feet bend while walking Otherwise they fit true to size I did not have to break in the width like I normally do on new shoes and they have stayed comfortable

on my left shoe the dye started wearing off I work in a office with carpet I was very disappointed so I will now have to purchase another pair I am somewhat skeptical about buying another pair from you or should I go buy a store where they would replace them if this happened but I do love the shoes I have worn stan smiths for 30 years

Wish the leather was a little softer and less likely to wrinkle

Great looking shoe comfortable even after a lot of wear and weather Simple ordering and received as described Will be buying again

Love it but wish I could customize with metallic trim

I like a lot the style of the stand smith you can wear it with everything

Very good stylish shoe Not really comfortable but I did not really expect to use these to run a marathon

Great as always I have worn them for years Never had black ones before Just as good as the white ones

I am able to be are united with adidas through this classic This shoe serves along with spiritual redemption with me personally everything sort of relates to each other

So simple Goes with almost everything It works with almost every type of outfit

I have always liked the Stan Smith sneakers and have owned several pairs in white I was looking for a dark sneaker and was glad to see different colors were now available I love my black Stan Smiths

I have been buying the shoes for 40 years they are still the best

They are comfortable and trendy perfect pairs for summers

Want 2 more

simple and fashion

Comfort superb I get compliments daily universally stylish

it is classic Stan Smeezies can not mess that up I only wish I could keep my strings cleaner

Great summer sneakers Very comfortable and stylish I got the white with dark blue Adidas heel patch which goes great with all of my shorts I also enjoy my Gazelles but the Stan Smith is a classic summer shoe In terms of sizing I buy my Stan Smitha half size larger than my Gazelles and they fit perfectly

I like it because they are very comfortable and look nice

Excellent everyday shoe The silhouette is super sleek with a low profile three stripes logo on the side and the stitching around the toe seems like it will keep the sole from separating They are also made of really soft feeling leather I am sure that these will last a long time but I am already noticing some stretch marks on the leather I guess it adds character and it probably can not be avoided with leather but I like my stuff to stay pristine It is pretty easy to keep these clean though so that is a huge plus

go with anythingdress up or down

Great reviews and I like Adidas I have good luck with this product

This Shoe runs small comfort level is stiff shoe looks good tho

this is my 14th pair of stand that should say it all

This is my 1st pair of Stan Smiths I ordered the all black pair I was immediately impressed with how comfortable the shoes were and loved the styling of them However after a month of wear the sole of the shoe developed a bubble with air trapped underneath I was able to exchange the shoes for a new pair for no charge but after another month the bubbles have formed on the soles of the new shoes as well It seems that this just happens to the soles of the Stan SmithsI have other Adidas shoes Samba Superstars and this has never happened to them

Perfect width for my foot Easy to clean and stay looking new

very comfortable and stylish classic shoes for everyone

Always fashion very good choice with this eternal chose

Just like the classic old School style just like the ones I had in high school



I bought it for my husband He loves new shoes it is very comfortable and nice

I like this product because it is very fashion and I use comfortable

Perfect price And comfortable i would recommend it

I love the shoes and my name printed on it but I made a mistake on the size and it is too small

I always want a pair of it and nice looking and price

Classic style Looks great I am glad they brought these back Very comfortable

Good Idk why they make submitting a review so hard tho

This shoe is great for the price and also very stylish

These shoes are so classy They go with everything you wear and make your look complete

Great purchse the product delivered fairly quickly fits well is comfortable and looks great What else is there

Clean white for tennis and personalized was a great addition

These are awesome I walked in them for a whole day and I did not have any problems They are both comfortable stylish and very versitile I would recommend to most but not to individuals who can not keep white shoes clean

I HAVE TO WEAR BLACK FOR WORK AND THESE SHOES FIT TE BILL THEY CAND BE SHINED UP TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS SHOE I have BEEN WEARING STAN SMITHS SINCE THE 70 LOVE them

Clean crisp classic dress up or dress down crisp white

beautiful and comfortable really nice sneakers

These sizes sell out very fast and they are in high demand

Finally some all leather white simple day shoes tennies that do not look like anime characters

Love the style of the Stans However I should have tried them in a store first

Great customized product with my nickname on it



Comfortable versatile stylish shoes I am thinking of buying another pair

Looks great and very comfortable to walk in My go to for the summer

Like the styling and quality of finishing Good value for the money

These shoes are so cool in person like I always see people in social media stunting these and honestly I get it now They are phenomenally stylish and well made My only real beef with this productlike many otherswas the size But that was entirely my own fault I normally wear a size 8 in womenand I went by the size chart and ordered a 7 in mensince I believed that would be the appropriate equivalent Well I was wrong and the shoe still came out to be too big I ordered it again men6 5 and now hope it fits when it arrives So fingers crossed

The shoes are very comfortable and look very nice Because they are simple they go well with any combination of clothes which is great Overall the shoes are amazing

Great pair of shoes you know exactly what you are getting when you buy these Stylish comfortable shoes

GREAT SHOE CLASSIC VERY COMFORTABLE WOULD DEF RECOMMEND

Fits exactly the way I like and amazing quality of course

Classic classy shoe Shipping was very fast inlike many other brands

it is very nice shoes White with collegiate red is very good combination

I have been wearing Stan Smiths for 25 years They have neve let me down

Nice looking shoe and is actually pretty comfortable Would recommend

Still a great shoe I wore these shoes when they first came out and they still have the same comfort and quality as the original Ware them as everyday shoes

Great shoes Simple and classic Love the way they look

the product is made in such a way that it makes it hot inside the shoe need to make it bit airy

The shoes are very comfortable and they look great

The shoe is one size to big compared to other Adidas shoes I got a 9 1 2 shoe because that what I wear when i buy other Adidas bought these and the show was too big At the same time they managed to be too narrow

I have been a fan of this style of sneaker for about two years now and this is my second pair This time I opted for a smaller size because I found the first was probably too big and was happy with this decision My only grievance is that this particular pair seems to have a sort of abnormality in the leather on the right shoe near the toe I probably could have asked for an exchange but I do not want it to go to waste so I will put up with it until it is time for another pair

Loves it Wrong size returned to repurchase new size

Great quality comfortable look and feel timeless

The most beautiful and elegant shoes I ever have it is classic and a must have one

Super fresh very good looking Only downside is they are not as comfortable or as breathable because of the leather

Menfashion staple suitable for every style you can think of I am mad I waited so long to purchase some

In the past over a three four years ago I have always bought 1 2 size smaller Anyone have experience with the sizing recently

They fit my high arch and they look good They are durable and comfortable

I have the all black and wear these anytime there is a formal or business casual dresscode The leather is soft and high quality looking and the black sole makes it perfect to conceal in business environments it is MUCH more comfortable than wearing a dress shoe and holds up just as well it is more comfortable than any Nike I ever owned but not as comfortable as some of adidas high end shoes But it is timeless classic and can be worn with anything For those looking for comfort and not concerned with price there is also now a boost version of this shoe

got them for my bf and he loves them I love them to

perfect price for the shoe just super comfortable love this Stan Smith

Beyond a beautiful looking shoe has maintained it is level of bright bright whiteness and feels of great quality I walk up down 3 flights of stairs every day at work and the stairs are coated with an abrasive kind of stain aimed to improve traction but my feet are too big and if I do not let enough of my foot hangover the stair the back of my shoe rubs and can scratch I have avoided scratching my Sam Smithas easily as I have a variety of other brands and shoe types from Pumas to Fossil boots to Redwing Boots I love these shoes

Love this sneaker it is super comfortable but order a 1 2 size down as they run big also if you have wide feet you might want to consider something else as these run a bit narrow I love them though and had a quick and easy purchase they arrived at my door in no time

I do not know why adidas quality in Jordan is not that perfect I have heard it many times that the quality here is lower than other countries For the size when i went to the shop they told me they do not have 36 2 3 and they gave me 37 1 3 But in general I am in love with them

Is Classic and Cozy You can wear it with everything

Comfortable clean and pairs with anything absolutely in love with these sneakers and I know they will become one of my wardrobe staples

My boyfriend loved the sneakers very comfy need to get half size bigger

the outsole fell off but every thing else is good i hate how i cant wear them i might have to super glue them

Have always been a fan of Stan Smith shoes and Adidas brand in general I wanted an all white stan smith so I decided for a customized version I normally wear size 6 but since customize version can not be returned i decided to go to the Footlocker and try the Stan Smith with the green heel patch I tried size 6 walked around the store and it was perfect Size was good I ordered it and waited patiently for it to arrive To my dissappointment the size 6 is too big I can put in both my index and middle fingers in between even after i put my foot in I can not return the shoes and now i am stuck with one that does not fit So dissappointed i still want my all white sneakers but now i am debating if i should just go with another brand or try to customize it again one size down

Great shoe super comfy and trendy goes with anything Ther is honestly nothing bad i have to say

This product is great My only complant is that I am having major heel slippage If anyone knows why that would help I orderd my true to size

Cheap but not the shoes Instead of skin substitute Drawings brands never seen Insoles are torn Do not buy

Very comfortable shoe This is my husbandsecond pair He just loves them I would recommend these shoes

Sized down 1 2 size Quality is great just like the good old days

I like it because the bottom of the shoe is hard and it last very long

A flexible and supportative shoe Newer shoes are too stiff

I love the sneakers I wish they did not run big

really liked it Hopefully everyones can get a pair Very good quality

Amazing shoe I really do not need any other shoes except this You can wear them with anything and last forever Thanks Adidas

Extremely comfortable shoes that look super clean as well However I tried walking with them in some rocky ground and when i got home I found them very scuffed and paint scratched off Disappointed

My first time bought Stan smith adidas brand I love them Very stylish and classic They gonna be my favorite from now on I ordered one size down it fit me perfectly

Comfortable great shoe for the price Would love to have in additional colors

Once again I have ordered from the website 1st mistake I own 7 pairs of Adidas So can anyone tell me why these are the wrong sizeIf those 7 I have 4 yes 4 different sized shoes Why is a size 12 not a size 12 all overGo in a store and save yourself this drama Apparently 12 inches varies from manufacturer to manufacturer SO over this waste of time SOrt it out please

I like the clean white shoe look with simple design The sole has small pads to reduce the cleaning of mud from shoe bottom My feet feel cushioned

I am usually a size 8 in shoes but for this I got a 7 and at first they felt a little uncomfortable but I just had to break them in

This is the second pair of Stan Smith I got and perfect about everything Comfortable when wearing it Style and fashion

easy to buy

trendy versatile sleek comfortable and good looking pair of shoes

Clean Comfortable Fashionable Simple Everyone has it

I love them because they are fashionable and comfortable Also because the leather stays white for a long time I used to wear them in the 80when they were in style and I am happy that they are once again a fashion trend Glad you are offering them in Pink

Not what I expected Would have like it if it was more like matt black

Shoes look sharp Simple style and comfortable Would buy again

Classic affordable and iconic This shoe can be worn with almost anything

The Stan Smithwere monogrammed and arrived factory direct from Portland Great experience and price The monogram is a nice personal touch great for gifting

I love thevfact you can customize a great classic shoe

ADIDAS quality is always outstandingit is also very stylish and in fashion

its great shoes fit fine they were cheap i am happy with my purchase

Perfect the stan smith shoes are the best ever

Perfect shoes sooo comfortable and sizing is accurate Must haves

I feel that adidas has changed there size chart 10 5 is no longer you have to size up a half size

These shoes crease way to easily I have had them for less then a week and they are already very creased No excessive activity was done in them Lastly they already came somewhat creased when shipped to me

These shoes are comfortable and stylish at the same time I wear them with slack kakis and jeans They give my feet the support and freedom I need to be comfortable on my feet all day

I would size down a half size but these are perfect I wear them almost every day easily my new favorite shoe

I purchased a pair of Adidas tennis shoes years ago They are my favorite pair of casual shoes They are leather with a very soft cloth material interior lining I love those shoes but they are falling apart I wear them without socks very comfy on the beach I have been looking for a similar pair for a few years The Stan Smith shoes are very similar in external appearance but lack the comfortable sole and soft cloth lining of my current Adidas I will keep hope alive

The price point is perfect you get what you pay for The fit is nice too

I love these shoes I wear them all the time They do run a little large so I ordered down and they are perfect I am usually a women8 5 9 and I got an 8

I think the color is cool and the material is super comfy The best thing about it is that you can pull up any look with this pair of sneakers

I love this pair of adidas They are a classic and they go with literally any outfit I especially love the green part of it because it makes it stand out a bit

With an arch insert

I love these shoes these are a great shoe for everyone

The shoe is nice Very versatile and great for those casual on the run looks over it is a great shoe

I can wear it with anything basically all season shoes

Too big just did not like them returned they run very big

Got white Stan Smith shoes because my favorite leisure shoes were black Stan Smith shoes that my wife said made me look like an old man

Perfect balance of style and comfort Sleek while durable Overall great shoe

A true classic I have been wearing them since 79

Looks great and seems pretty resistant to getting dirty These shoes do run really big though

I like the style of the products but what I do not like how much the shoe creases I have only wore them twice and there is already crease marks even though I have been very careful about them

Classic shoes They are super comfortable and stylish

Perfect shoe to use in basic streetwear fashion Either these basic ones or the Raf Simmons and you are good to go for a long time

They comfortably fit but are a little too wide I like the style of all black shoes I like the stan smiths and I get a lot of compliments on them

good product with ugly face on shoe tongue not sure why adidas decided to put stan smith face on a tongue but on white sneakers it is quite noticeable I would refrain to put any face on a tongue especially old guy with not such a good looks I have been buying stan smith shoes for many years because of they comfort and simple look not because I am a big fan of that guy

I used to wear these shoes many years ago Glad they are back

Super comfy looks great with almost everything only better pair is Raf simmons stans

I have worn Stan Smiths for over 30 years They are my only go to shoeGreat quality all leather product My last pair lasted 3 years and going strong I have worn mine on musical tours all over the world Keep up the good work

I bought these in my true size 6 5 mens and they were very tight for a while until I broke them in and i think the leather stretched a little It was very painful for my big toes I will be honest I will probably buy another pair in a 7 These have a classic minimalist silhouette that goes with virtually everything Everyone should have a pair of these and they are very on trend

I wore Stan Smith in the 70and loved it Now I am loving it again

Everything it says to be Comfortable stylish and affordable My boyfriend loves them

Love them I had to order a youth size 5 5 I am usually a women38 5 and the 7 5 was too big for me Finally got the right size after ordering twice

Super preppy old school Ran large I wear a true 6 and 4 1 2 fit perfectly

Price was good perfect size for me when i wear it is feel comfortable

Stan Smith Pinwheels Holy Grail of shoes Literally everywhere I go wearing this I get huge positive energy I visited SamTailor in Hong Kong and the suitmakers were immediately freaking out These guys hang out with celebrities every day for sure they want their customers to be happy but they were genuinely elated I was planning on wearing a custom white suit with these Stan Smiths Out here in Asia the design is so much more future than in the USA I really hope Adidas continues pushing the envelope and making some seapunk vaporwave tumblr cyberpunk style shoes for the kids Especially back in the US not many companies are really pushing the limits of design in that way yet I know based on my Stan Smith pinwheels that Adidas is one brand who is actively stepping it up Please make some vaporwave cyber shoes

I got these shoes because of the style but I was not sure how comfortable they were going to be or how well they would fit but I love these shoes I show them off and they are super comfortable and I can just slip them on I do recommend getting a size up

Good quality comfortable timeless design The Adidas Stan Smith are a must have in your shoe collection

I wanted leather tennis shoes I had these as a kid and loved them They lasted forever and they are great to wear all day The leather is supportive and my feet do not hurt do not get hot

I love this style shoes it is very cool and comfortable

Thank you Adidas for continuing to make these wonderful sneakers

Classic pair great quality with reasonable price

I love these shoes They look great and go perfect with pretty much anything I am so happy that I bought them

My Stan Smiths are sporty yet fashionable They are comfortable walking around town as well as running on the tennis court

I loved it I would recommend go half a size smaller

Good looking shoe that is also comfortable Fits as expected

These are my babiez A foot love affair if I may On my third pair diz is only th beginning

Should come in different colors

I just plain love these shoes They are cute I am a 60 year old female and I get lots of compliments on them I wear them to work too

I love adidas and have bought so many shoes from them over the years These Stan Smith shoes were the most uncomfortable shoes I can recall owningand are made from materials that seem rather cheap

look the same as the old ones butt the new ones have no arch support at all Why pay for quality and not get any more than a discount store

On the surface the shoes are quite simple it is amazing that they look so amazing with such simplicity involved Adidas nailed it with these

My hubby has been wearing stan smiths for 25 yrs will not wear anything else I guess that is a true testamonial

I bought this as an everyday walk around shoe and I was disappointed The shoe is uncomfortable and made walking around difficult I was excited by the look of the shoe but was very disappointed when I actually started wearing it

Love it Very simple and comfortable Would def recommend this

Adidas Stan Smiths were great in the 70s great in the 80s great in the 90s great in the 00s etc As long as the clean simple white leather tennis shoe with the green tag at the heel exists the world is a better place

I love the way these shoes fit They are so comfortable I love the iconic design but I am a little concerned about how I will keep them clean My only issue is that i had to buy an entire size down I am typically size 13 in pretty much every shoe brand but these were far too big for me I would recommend going 1 2 to a full size down

Prefect comfort look and feels very light on my feet Best shoes ever purchased

I will definitely buy more Stan Smith pairs Just love them

I have been using Stan Smith since last few years and now I do not even consider buying any other shoes

The only little downside is how easily the shoe creases which all depends on how you use wear the shoe aside from that I highly recommend this shoe to anyone unsure wether to purchase a pair or not

So i bought the newly stocked ones and let me tell you that the quality on these are bad but not horrible The soles has excess rubber cuts excess glue marks the holes which make up the stripes had cracks on them Its those small details that throw me off but overall i liked it Good quality leather and the form is just right Sizing was on point so go TTS

I am 6 5 in the runners and size 6 for women in Superstars so i ordered 6 since it is a sneaker but i came small to me

My soon to be ex wife and I got a divorce and the only thing I got to keep was my vast collection of shoes This will only add to my collection Thanks Adidas

The shoes were everything I hoped for and even looked better in person Great buy that I would recommended to anyone

Stan Smithare clean and a solid shoe for summer months They run true to size I am a 11 5 12 in sneakers and got 11 5 as they run a tad bit wide If you have a wide foot go up 1 2 a size Otherwise great shoe clean design I recommend

I really like it It looks great and it is comfortable

I need the shoes of kids about 4 this shose is too big to fit in it

I love this 1973 original Stan Smith I am OLD SCHOOL CLASSIC CLEAN and sMOOTH

These are great Fit true to size maybe get a half size larger than usual for a less tight fit You will not regret this purchase These shoes are comfortable warm sturdy and match everything I have owned 2 pairs one with a green heel and one with a navy blue one Both look great but I slightly prefer the blue one

Make sure to check if it is menor womenDefinitely go for 1 size down if you are a female shopping in menshoes

I was worried about this shoes because the superstar are really narrow but i tried on and it was amazing

Great shoes can not wait to wear these once all the snow melts Super comfortable all purpose perfect

The title does not mean I want to write a few words

I really liked the shoe I will wear them right Trust me 

Stan smiths are really well made and look good with everything

The sizing was the only problem while purchasing these shoes I wear a WOMENS 7 5 I ended up buying a MENS 6 because for women getting menstan smith adidas recommends getting 1 5 SIZES DOWN this is just because the shoes usually run a half size big other than this the shoes are perfect and super comfortable They are super cute and i get compliments all of the time Also they are great for people with high arches like me

i love the color the price and free shipping reading the reviews about the size i ordered half size smaller i ended up receiving the correct size i ordered but smaller for me i should have stick to my original size now there is no available size on the color i wanted i still gave adidas 5 star and would recommend this product because of its quality and appearance

They are pretty comfortable and they match with almost every outfit They are great

I love how these shoes look but I have to make sure to wear bandaids until they are completely broken in because the back is pretty stiff Also they are just a little bit narrow but nothing crazy it is to be expected with new shoes

the shoes came on time i was surprised when I got it addressed to my work love it

These shoes are bomb advice all to buy a pair

The shoes have style but they are so uncomfortable Literally hurts to wear do not buy these just buy something else

Masterful rework of a timeless design Loving the Chicago Horween Leather upgrade Definitely have to do the same in the Shell Cordovan next

I had to return it because it was half size to large

I got mine personalized which takes them to another level for me

Im US 9 Womens I got 8 5 for these shoes however then run 2 sizes bigger than usual I should have gotten size 7 instead Hope they will restock been wanting these shoes for so long

I love the color that is on the back looks good feel green when I wear the shoes

Just bought this shoes this week and after 2 days it was delivered Fast super fast shipping Been looking for this shoes and my size luckily I was able to purchase it only The quality is perfect and the style is vintage With Adidas Stan Smith you will not go wrong baby its off the hook shoes I will pair this with my skinny and jogger pants

All in all is a great shoe Goes well with a lot of my clothes the leather is nice and soft comfortable to wear really no complaints with it so far The only thing for me is that my foot is kind of wide so it fits a liiiitttttlllllleeeee narrow but hardly noticeable Love this shoe would definitely recommend

Stans are the only court shoe I have worn From squash to racket ball over the last 30 years

I was so happy to finally get a pair of these I got the polka dot ones with the gold stripe adds a really unique but subtle touch The polka dots are actually navy so they are different than shown but I actually like it a lot better than white I am usually size 7 7 5 ended up going with a 6 and they fit perfectly so definitely size at LEAST half size down

These Stanare amazing The leather quality is like no other sneakers I have ever seen I want to buy a second pair just to save for when these wear out PLEASE adidas make these in Black I need them in black notice I said need not want NEED They are worth it buy them now

I have been wanting to get my hands on a pair of the Stan Smiths in New Navy for a while but they always seem to be sold out in womensizes No problemI thought I will size down in the mensizeI was surprised to see that the official Adidas sizing chart only accounts for one size difference between the Menand WomenUS sizes ie a women9 5 is a men8 5 when typically there is a 1 5 2 difference for most brands I ignored my instincts and went with what the Adidas website stated and ordered the men8 5 for myselfand just as I feared the shoes I received feel a full size too large That being said they are still comfy squishy sneakers and I can pull off the larger size if I wear a thicker sock They do not look like clown shoes on my feet despite being too big and they are so stylish and cute No regrets over here but if you are a stickler for size I would recommend trying them on for fit in a store first

Ecstatic that Stan Smiths are once again readily available I am on my 4th pair

I only have good things to say about these These shoes will 

The Horween Leather is amazingly soft and accommodating for my wide feet Good fit looks great well tanned They are like the Loni Anderson of footwear WKRP Loni Anderson

I sold my car for these shoes 10 10 would do it again

Very nice and comfortable

DO NOT TAKE THESE SHOES OFF THE MARKET THEY ARE GREAT AND I HOPE YOU ARE SELLING ALOT OF THEM THE FIT IS GREAT

I have been wearing this same shoe the exact style for over 40 years It is the only tennis shoe I wear Over the years friends and family have given me other tennis shoes to wear and they just do not measure up to the Stan Smith I am a professional photographer and am outside on my feet up in all kinds of terrain and this is my everyday shoe The last for a very long time and are a great value I have only been able to find them on direct order for the past few years but as long as Adidas keeps making them I will keep buying them

One of the most versatile shoes you could buyyou can can wear with formal wear like suits or casual wear like denim

I have worn Stan Smith tennis shoes both for casual and performance on the court for over forty years Was and still is the most comfortable and stylish shoe ever made Not into some flashy design and colors Especially do not need my shoes to do that on or off the court actions speak louder than shoes

i received my stan smith with different laces than the ones online The ones i got are white with black dots that do not match the shoes at all and that look very bad Very disappointing They could have At least made sure the online description is correct or sent the right shoes as per the description I would not recommend those shoes unless you do not mind receiving surprise type of laces

I love the simple lines understated entire package of this combo is there anything wrong with this shoeNo Nada Nyet

These are great shoes Recommend buying a size bigger they run smaller I typically where a size 13 and I bought these shoes in a size 14

Great shoe

These shoes were a little too narrow for my feet Also the look of these shoes is different than the picture especially in natural light The picture makes them look grayish with a black and white mesh material Underneath the black mesh is actually gold and much shinier than I expected Not a bad shoe but it was a little more narrow than most of the Adidas I have owned

so glad I made this purchase and at a great price

I usually wear womansize 6 my feet are 23cm I buy this shoes in mensize 4 5 and they fit for me perfect However after I wear them my feet feel a little bit moist and sultry Overall I really recommend this shoes They can wear with jeans dress and any other clothes

So clean and so comportable

The stan Smith VULC is a great shoe I like this vulc style more than the regular stan smith It reminds me the gazelleand if they had a slimmer sole they will remind me the sambaLooking at this shoe and then the adi superstar makes me think why not bring the adi san remo in black and in white Overall great shoes hope you guys restock this shoe It is a must

These look like a cheap knock off with the weird puffy tongue In Europe they get the original style tongue Why does the UMarket always get the bobo versionI sent these back and ordered a pair from Europe The leather is also much nicer on the version the rest of the world gets

So yeah They are really comfy and lots of cusion in the shoe which I think is great I already have 2 pairs of stan smith LOVE YOU GUYS

these shoes had great promise i love the idea of using kevlar as a material and wish they would of worked out they fit pretty narrow and the arches were too high for my feet feet were in pain after only minimal wear maybe a size up would help but shoes felt stiff overall color shows through more yellow then i would like i got them for the black look but in the end the yellow was too much for what i wanted would be a sweet shoe with some improvements in comfort and color

Love my stans all 5 of them

This shoe is nice shoe with good quality leather and has lots of colors to choose from They are very comfortable and run true to size I also get a lot of compliments on them Overall Adidas did a great job on this classic

the show is great especially the color way I picked out it is sure to turn heads I love them and expect me to purchase more color ways

It is my first time to purchase online in USA Good experience for me Thanks

i was scare cause i didnt know how is was gona fit but it was perfect have gotten alot complement on them

iam happy all my frend wach and like

great shoe very nice and comfy but when I got them they already were creased along the sides this upset me very much

This sneaker is comfortable and some designs are a must grab They should make many more

I am a little obsessed with Adidas shoes because their the only ones i wear I would have to say these Stan Smith shoes are the most comfortable shoes I own

Everyone has their classics and must have shoes and Stan Smiths are definitely it for me Fits true to size very comfortable and stylish at the same time

just as I expected

The quality of the leather on these shoes is awful Adidas has sent me two pairs now and the leather on each pair was creased horribly out of the box I have attached some photos

The appearance is definitely impeccable One uncomfortable thing is that after walking for 2 hours wearing them you will feel your heel a little pain maybe that will be improved after this polishing period with the new shoes

The sneaker is great for my casual attire and the feel is quite comfortable

looks great feels great

So comfortable and extremely good quality leather molds right to your foot I been wearing them almost every day and i have 20 sneakers in my collection

Runs about 2 sizes large I bought an 8 5 and it is way too long will need a 6 5 but they are sold out and these are too long for me and I normally wear an 8 5

I bought my first pair of Stan Smithin 1985 and have worn at least one pair each year since then

simple sneakers good

Because the womenstyles were all sold out I ordered the stan smith in fairway white in a man7 5 I usually wear an 8 in womensizes The shoes are soft and comfy and fit perfectly with socks on

Runs big I usually wear 6 5 in women and bought a 5 5 which fit well with still a lil room Overall cuteness

My only complaint is the insoles seem to be glued on and I am one of those people who uses inserts Had to rip them off to get mine in but other than that I am loving them so far

Just got these bad boys this week for my summer Stans These are a little dressier and more stylish than typical old school sneaks so you can wear them with a nice pair of chinos or a structured pair of shorts The inside feels a little different than my winter Stans almost like it was designed with the intention to be worn without sock These shoes are great and I love how Adidas is expanding the Stan line up with a fun and versatile selection of styles

I love the fit I love this shoe

Fits awesomely they might look better with fat laces but not mad at the one that came with them They look good in person and even better on your feet got alot of attention because of them at a bbq

This shoe is great style and comfort wise only issue is it fits a little bug but after you get used to it the shoe is great

I dig these kicks They fit great and have a good amount of support Also the Stan Smith is a classic and this colorway gives them a toned down and elegant look Works great with jeans shorts even khaki pants You could even wear them with a suit if that is your thing

very good nice

beautiful shoes there should be hi top model Top ten high model is the same all ugly hip hop ish look sneaker styles seem to be getting pretty bad every year whatever makes money I guess

Fits great At the age of 50 This shoe takes me back to 1977 when I bought my first pair this is my 5th pair love the classic look and feels good on my feet I like the white shoe with the green tab on the back of shoe

I purchased these for my pre teen boy and he loves themthe classic style is coming back

Great looking shoe but also extremely light and comfortable

I wear them to the gym and they are very comfortable on the treadmill for an hour and the same on the rowing machine They are good looking and fit well

Fit good and look good too

Adidas created these classics and they look great with shorts joggers or even a suit

Overall very comfortable to wear

What I expected

Great shoe Comfortable and would wear them all time Not too sure how they would hold up for skating but I can see the potential to be a great skate shoe Almost like chuckwith better look

Got these shoes last week and I absolutely love them They are super light and yet they have just the right amount of support Materials seem durable and easy to clean I got them in dust blue and the color is on point almost grey with a hint of blue Simplistic overall yet very stylish I have gotten tons of compliments on them already Definitely considering buying another pair in a different color and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for some all purpose casual kicks

I recommend Stan Smith to everyone who love to be in style and fasion together with quality I ha dthis shoes for so long even when i was in college and up to now i really love the comfort and style For me Stan Smith is the best for any age love it so much

Really nice shoes

Would Recommend And Has My Approval

100 good the love shoes fell in love with me

Did not fit well and the quality of the leather was horrible

A good shoe I like classic Adidas shoes I do not like boost I do not like how Adidas is making almost all their running shoes with boost Adidas please make your future athletic shoes with more variety not just boost

They look sharp

Stan smith Adidas shoe is a great shoe

I really like the shoes are very comfortable

These shoes look amazing They have a great silhouette and the design is marvelous The shoeall white color with a subtle flash of green looks great I highly recommend this

Big Adidas fan from years gone by

I have been wearing these since 6th grade 45 years and never thought to go any where else Always comfy and have great support for someone with a high arch Thanks for bringing them back

I have been using this sneaker since college uptil now Last time I bought this was a little less than a decade ago and been trying to preserve it since I thought I would never find another one ever So glad to know its produced again with much more flavours Great job guys Thank you

I have been wearing stan Smithsince the 70When you took it off the market I shopped every store internet flea market that I could find just to get a pair My children sent me the ad that you put Stan Smithback on the shelf I could not be happier Bravo Kathy

This was an excellent buy for the price finish line out did itself again thank you

I love this shoe I bought these as a gym track shoe and another pair of regular Pureboost as a recovery lifestyle shoe since I run so many miles These shoes started me on a serious Adidas kick and I hunted down the Ultraboost ST for my long mileage I LOVE the Pureboost RBL but there is one problem with them Ever since I have been running in them I have noticed a lot of friction at the front of my feet on the bottom The FLAT insole does not cup feet well and causes friction when I run I am also noticing arch pain I never had before running in these shoes I am pretty sure it is MY feet and these shoes being incompatible but I really like them so I am looking for a pair of Superfeet Insoles to help out

Feel good its light weight great color also feels good when I am walking or running

Flexible and comfortable locks in your heels nicely

Feels like you are walking on a little mattress It looks great

Comfortable Disappointed that the heel loop ripped off within 6 months of minimal wear Otherwise I would have rated them 5 stars

The running show is extremely comfortable and light weight Already ran a total of 30 miles and I am happy with my selectionquality running gear

It hurts my ancle and feet when I run and I think it is nor for running

They were exactly what I needed

I wear a size 11 Ultraboost and find the Pureboost RBLs to fit similarly I prefer these to the 2017 Pureboost and the Pureboost DPRs and actually prefer it to the Ultraboost due to the increased stability

Great support and comfort Not the best to play volleyball in but overall great

Secure confident fit Everyday comfort Lifestyle sport type shoe

This shoe is ultra comfortable and stylish one of the best shoes I have ever had

These shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever put on The shoe comes with so many good things just walking in them it feels like your walking on air because of how soft the sole is The material is very comfortable and flexes well for running and walking The only real con i found is that the shoe is a bit narrow at the end of the arch but still remains very comfortable as the material flexes enough that your foot can still go flat

Awesome shoe very comfortable and hugs your foot like a glove Will definitely purchase another pair

I like tis product because it has great arch support and good reflective lining around the shoe for when you are running or just wearing the she around town and they have a almost sock like fit where I do not even use the shoe laces Over all good shoe but runs a little big would getxc2 xbd down

I like this product because it is good looking and comfortable

The shoes came unraveled within 3 weeks of us ordering them

I purchased these for myself and they are feel and look great

The look is fantastic The feel is amazing Everything exceeded my expectations

First time with Adidas shoe that I had problems either the size it is too tight for size 10 that i usually order

this shoe is so comfy my feet fill free the knit dose well keeping everything together the grippy soles are a blast

could not wait to try these out when I got them It was raining on my first outing and am happy to say my feet stayed dry

Love the style Extremely comfortable Love the color scheme

I bought these for my boyfriend for Valentine Day I bought the size he normally wears in Adidas but he was not even able to get his foot in them He does have wider feet These shoes look great but need a little stretch for those with wider feet

I purchased these shoes in black for my 19 year old son He loves them as they are comfortable and stylish He can wear them with joggers while walking across campus for class or just out with a nice pair of jeans I am going to order him a different color

This is a very nice looking and comfortable looking shoe that you can often get for a great deal I would definitely a recommended this shoe It is very solid for the price

I love them they look awesome with track pants and a hoodie I love finishline

Great looking shoe I recommend if you are not afraid to wear pink

These shoes are great Like a sock with laces That Alphabounce bottom is second to none in comfort These shoes were very tight on delivery however after wearing them several times they are great You will not be sorry if you add these to your collection

At first was not so sure about the shoe but turned out to be very comfortable

Looks and feels amazing Extremeley comfortable for running

These shoes provide looks comfort and anything else you could want I use these for training and running These are shoes that do not get uncomfortable

This is the best purchase I have made from buying shoes online

They rub wrong on the top of my feet and cannot wear for more than a couple hours

I like these shoes very much From a style and comfort perspective they earn a 100 in my book

Shoes were great super secure while lifting also durable for working out

shoes were super durable with running a long marathon

This is a great shoe that has great quality It is great for working out

Great colorway perfect fit perfect for active wear as well as casual

Nice shape and great look good prices Excellent fit

But the comfort compared to pure ultraboost did not even come close

Been wearing another shoe brand for over 40 years and all I can ask myself is whySuper comfortable shoe and lightweight Best decision ive made in a long time

Great overall shoe Comfortable with a nice look Runs slightly small so 1 2 size up

Its odd but hot The shoe is that isnt something no other brand has

A snug supportive fit but lace lightly The laces pinch the top of the foot if tight

I like because the quality design confort cost

Honestly these are very different from the shoes I usually wear but I love them They have a very interesting design that looks really cool on your feet

These feel great and fit perfect i have wide feet and have no problem with these

These shoes are comfy Durable and stylish They also make me feel taller

This is the first sneaker in a long time that has adequate lateral support these knit sneakers have terrible Lateral support I pronate so its important to me

REALLY LOVE THE WAY THESE FIT AND FEEL WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN gt 

it is good and works perfect for everyday especially work

Overall great sneakers Fit great and the look is amazing

it is light comfortable and stylish I quite literally feel the bounce in each step And the design is really good

did not realize these were as they came but very happy ordered 2 pair

Great shoes all around 10 10 would recommend to anyone

Awesome shoe Feels like I am running with an extra BOUNCE in my step

These shoes are amazing They look great feel great and leave me totally satisfied I would definitely recommend these to any and everyone

I am an RN and on my feet all day These might be the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn

The material is incredible and very durable They look incredible My only issue that is not a big deal is the brown plastic in the sides near the sole are angled to where they dig into the foot of someone with wide feet Not a big deal I just keep the shoes a bit loose to compensate I am very pleased with them

Buy them now Like right now Why are you still reading thisThey better be at your house by this time in the review

Great all purpose shoes You can go from the gym to hanging out

Fits great not as wide as some might think Very good

I got them because they looked like a very comfortable shoes that had a current look Upon receiving them and trying them on my predictions about the comfort were spot on but the appearance just did not grow on me I just could not see myself rocking them on the daily

I love the style and fit however I have not worn them out yet

After a few wears the front toe is peeling back

Well made Better than lower cost shoe I tried earlier You get what you pay for

I Absolutely Love everything about them i would buy again

The base of the shoe is unlike any of the previous Alpha bounce styles It slims out the look of the foot and draws the attention of everyone in the room

I love these sneakers Their not only comfortable but very bright in color and stylish Very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend this sneaker to anyone who stands for long periods of time or who are active people who engage in exercising

Highly recommend if your trying to bring back the 90s swag I love them so much I bought both pair

Reflective are pretty cool

From the moment I slipped these on I realized how far Nike has come with their already excellent shoes The fact I could buy a new version of an old favorite colorway made these even nicer These are remarkably comfortable and ready for any workout I can throw at them Great style great price and supreme comfort make them my new favorite Nike shoes

I am a barber standing most days 10 12 hours I have flat feet sore heels and wear compression socks really I need them I have 2 pairs of vapormax flynit which is comfortable but have to rotate sneakers during the day to my surprise these utility vapormax feel a bit more cushioned bouncey all around comfortable I wore them all day without any discomfort My new work shoes

These are my first vapormax they are very comfortable and lightweight I like the lacing system where you can slip on and tighten without having to tie shoe strings They are my only shoes that make noise while walking so be aware if you are a librarian If they were not so expensive I would buy 2 or 3 more pair right now

These shoes make you feel like your walking on air and bubbles Literally Their extremely comfortable More comfortable than Air MaxYou also bounce a little with each walk Overall great shoe awesome quality and water repellency is true

Fits like other vapormax I am a 9 5 10 in Nike Went with a 10 and they fit great Lacing mechanism is unique and do hold tight during exercise Recommend them

The vapor max are really light and very comfortable

I have bought a lot of shoes and these ones are definitely my favorite I wear them to the gym daily and they have held up great

My favorite vapormax I absolutely love these shoes Very comfortable and stylish The sizing is perfect and the lacing toggle is so convenient for those days you just want to go NIKE if you could please bring back the White Tropical Twist Team Orange Black colorway in a 8 5 I promise I will buy a pair

I BOUGHT 2 PAIRS I THINK THEY HIT IT OFF WITH THIS MODEL I HOPE THEY MAKE MORE COLOR WAYS ROYAL BLUE AND BLACK ps I could not adjust the slider for size and durability levels on this post

I purchased a NikeiD pair first and waited 5 plus weeks to get them however during the wait I purchased the pair with the blue reflective side strings I love these shoes for what they represent and how it is executed Besides looking good they shed rain effectively I liked this shoe so much I purchased a 3rd pair in all black My NikeID pair are black with translucent gray and looks unique but I have gotten many compliments can not wait for my all black pair to arrive These are not a light as my Flynit 2s or MOC 2s but they are quite light for a utility shoe and I highly recommend them

These sneakers are mad comfortable I love them I just wish that they were still on NikeID

I have gone through an absurd amount of different shoes trying to find the right one for the gym running This is by far the best shoe out of all of them including the Reacts Air Max 1997Air Max 2017Vapormax Flyknits etc The fit is perfect and I found them to be true to size Supportive comfortable and you get that bit of a bounce when running I liked them so much that after a week of wearing them I bought the all black ones as well As I find with all Air Max shoes they do need a bit of a break in period Once broken in a really great shoe Now if only Nike would make a pair in the Obsidian colorway hint hint Nike

Just picked up a pair of these a few days ago Very comfortable but takes getting used to

These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned and I have been wearing Nike for 30 years My feet are really walking on air I am lost for words great shoes great design the air bubbles are super light

I have three variations of the VaporMax lineUtility Fly Knit 2 and Fly Knit Premium These live up to the line with great fit comfort and style Love them because I can wear in cold months comfotably and my feet stay warm Brilliant design and utility Great job Nike

Like running on air Great looking design on the lace up and the feel of the material is nice I would agree with the one reviewer that they seem to squeak a bit extra loud compared to my other running shoes Overall Nike did a nice job with the shoe Fits true to size

Tried the shoes on in store when they dropped The right sole squeaked like crazy on the pollished cement floor Ordered online Got them and the upper is squeaky where the flywire meets with the leather eyelets Not going to deal with it going to return Other that making noise is a super comfortable shoe

These are great shoes super comfortable and warm have not had them in water yet we will see how that goes

A direct from my 17yr old the moment he saw my new shoes I purchased the black version and it is the most comfortable and most stylish beast I owned and I am a sneaker freak with over 100 pair Fit is spot on for a 9 5 and the lace lock system is far superior to that of the other AirMax Vapor shoes with the pinch toggles lacing it is a spendy shoe but so worth it

These shoes were awesome and I will continue to buy lebrons

I have the Lebron 15 15 Low 16 and now the 16 low This is by far the best one it is the lightest lowest to the court most supportive of all of them I highly recommend this shoe to anyone

Really good shoe size is perfect really comfortable when playing in If playing on a dirty court they do pick up a lot of dust but on a decent court their perfect Also not bad for being a low top make sure to tie your shoes tight tho otherwise the overall shoe is perfect and would recommenced for anyone wanting a reliable pair of shoes like the creativity of the colorway
