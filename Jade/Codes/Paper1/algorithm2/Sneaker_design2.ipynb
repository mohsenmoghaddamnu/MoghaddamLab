      "Parsing [sent. 1 len. 317]: I ve been wearing the asics numbus model for years going back to version 11 I ve always loved the fit and incredible cushioning Asics really messed up the sizing on version 19 as was pointed out by numerous reviewers I generally wear a medium width and sometimes even a narrow in certain shoes and had to go to a 4E width on version 19 for it to feel comfortable I was very excited when version 20 was supposed to have an improved fit and was hoping it would feel like my previous versions I do agree that version 20 is not as tight as version 19 which was unwearable but it still does not fit right in my opinion I usually am a 15 D and this size still feels way too tight particularly in the toe box My toes are jamming against the edges of the shoe and feel compressed My heel also feels as if it is crossing over the back edge of the foot bed making me think the shoe is too narrow I tried on the 15 2E although I ve never had to wear a wide shoe in my life - it felt a bit better in the toe area but the rest of the shoe feels just that - too wide On the positive side it is a lightweight shoe with very good cushioning If one is able to go up a 1 2 size I would definitely suggest this That s a problem however when you are a size 15 and there is no size 15 and 1 2 only a size 16 which is way too big Overall there are some positive aspects to the shoe but in my opinion the sizing is still way off and nothing like all the previous models I ve come to adore I ll be trying on other brands now for sure\n",
